Supporting young people affected by the mental illness of a parent or sibling
We provide information, resources and support for children and young people who care for, or are affected by, a parent or sibling’s mental illness.
We’ve also developed a number of projects to raise awareness of the difficulties faced by these children and young people.
Our workshops for children and their families explore the issues they may experience, and aim to help overcome fears and stigma associated with mental illness, in a friendly, supportive and fun environment.
‘Kidstime workshops help me to be a kid again.’
With some of our partner organisations, we have also produced a number of training programmes to help professionals in the health, education and social care fields gain an insight into the needs of young carers and how to provide the best possible help and support for them.

The Hub Model
To find out more about our local Hub Model for delivering the Kidstime Methodology in your area please contact us here.

What is a Local Hub?
The idea of the Hub brings together the Kidstime Workshop for families and the Who Cares? programme for schools. Having close links between the Kidstime Workshop and Who Cares? allows the family to become aware of the support in school and similarly the schools can become more aware of the support provided for affected families through the Kidstime Workshop.  We believe that this approach will be both more effective in supporting the children of parents with mental illness and will reach a larger number of families and children through the development of the regional clusters. Our aim is to build on the work already being done in schools and use that network to build a sustainable support system for families and children affected by parental mental illness.

Our Origins

The Kidstime Foundation works with young people significantly impacted by parental mental illness, their parents, carers, teachers and peers, to build resilience, reduce morbidity and improve life outco

Origins and History
In 1999, at a key national conference called Keeping the Family in Mind, a group of young people made an angry, passionate presentation about what it meant to be a child caring for a parent experiencing mental illness when adult help arrived:
‘the worst thing was when the mental health services got involved … they came in like the SAS to take our parent, no one explained anything, and worse still no one asked our advice or what we knew.’
The Kidstime Groups and later the Foundation were a response to this impassioned plea for change and visibility.
The scale of the issue
An initial estimate by Aldridge and Becker identified approximately 65,000 young carers of parents with mental illness in England and Wales, with about 1 million children significantly affected. In 2010, the Social Care Institute for Excellence updated this estimate to 2 million children.
The negative impacts of parental mental illness on their children are well documented (Oats, 1997; Nicholson et al, 1999, 2004; Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2011), with 70% of affected young people experiencing one or more of:
Loss of education through poor attendance and emotional distraction.
High levels of anxiety about the parent/s and their own potential of succumbing to the same illness.
Social isolation resulting from stigma, rejection by peers and self-isolation.
Guilt and an excessive sense of personal responsibility.
High levels of subsequent depression.
Fortunately, quite small interventions have been shown to substantially increase a child’s resilience and ability for self-protection. (Quinton and Rutter 1984; Rutter, 1966). Clear information and explanation of the parent’s illness, and of the impact on themselves of the illness and its treatment has been consistently shown to improve resilience (Bostock, 2004; et al.). A study of 11–15 year olds living with a depressed parent, by Garly et al. (1997) found they wanted information and discussion with a knowledgeable but neutral adult to help them understand 4 key aspects of their parent’s illness:
The nature and cause of the illness, including their own feelings of responsibility and vulnerability.
How to recognise the signs of an impending illness.
When a parent should be hospitalised, and what happens when this occurs.
How to manage the illness and its effect on both themselves and their parent.
“It’s the idea that it’s not her [my Mum’s] fault, because it’s not her fault, it’s her illness.”
“Before, I just didn’t want to speak to my mum, or acknowledge her. [Kidstime helped me with] the understanding that she wasn’t in control of it.”
“It was no body’s fault really, it just happened to her [my Mum] and it can happen to 1 in 4 people too.”
Juliet, 11 years old, Kidstime workshop attendee

The Finnish Adoption (Tienari et al., 1994, 2004) study and earlier work by Rutter (Rutter et al Rutter M., 1996, 2004) demonstrated that when relationships in the child’s environment are improved, the child’s future resilience to mental illnesses, even when they carry a genetic vulnerability, is enhanced. But major interventions like adoption are rarely required and in fact quite small interventions can make a significant difference. Even such small interventions as explanation of a parents’ s illness have been shown to significantly improve the child’s mental health.
The Kidstime Foundation has connected with MindEd to link up with resources that can help you with a child who is dealing with their own mental illness. MindEd is somewhere you can find out about common signs of mental health problems affecting children and young people. Important: If you are concerned about someone who is at immediate serious risk you should contact your local support services immediately. To find our more about how to help these children please see here.

KIDSTIME WESTMINSTER


Kidstime in Westminster educates children to understand that mental illness, just like a physical illness, can affect anybody. It is nobody’s fault. With role playing, games and exercises, confidence and self-worth improves.
Teenagers can get involved in structuring the programme, assisting the drama worker in putting together scripts and co-producing for all to enjoy acting out scenes.
Kidstime in Westminster gives adults the opportunity to learn about mental health from professionals, led by clinical psychologist Dr. Jo Early. Parents and guardians share experience in the mutually supportive discussion group. They often make new friends among peers and, feeling better about themselves, are motivated to better address their issues and make best use of the help and support available in the local community.
Location: BESSBOROUGH CHILDREN’S CENTRE; 1 Bessborough Street, Pimlico, London SW1V 2JD
When it meets: Workshops are held the last of the month during term time. Transport is arranged for families to arrive at 5pm for healthy drinks and snacks. Later pizzas are served. The workshop ends at 7.30pm.
Kidstime in Westminster. Safe, welcoming and stigma free!

Wirral Kidstime Workshop needs support to keep going.

We are raising money to keep the Wirral Kidstime Workshop going after funding cuts. Please help us raise money to keep this amazing initiative going!!
You can donate directly to this campaign here.                                          Please get in touch if you are running an event here.

Why is Kidstime important?
If left unchecked, it can be easy for a child or young person to have the wrong idea about an adult’s mental health difficulty. This can range from the child feeling responsible, wrongly blaming themselves for causing the condition, to a young person worrying about ‘catching’ a mental health illness.
By helping to open up conversations, sharing factual information and working through resources and activities, the Kidstime programme supports children, young people and their families to find ways of talking about mental health difficulties that can be acceptable to all of them. This can help to reduce anxiety and avoid uncertainty and half-truths, allowing fears and concerns to be named and addressed.

 
Kidstime takes action on helping us learn about mental health in really fun ways. We use a lot of drama to help us figure out our own thoughts and feelings about our parent’s difficulty.
This makes it easier for us to express things in a way that is interesting and easy to understand.
Kidstime is never boring!

Hear from our young people and our team about the issues affecting children who have a parent with a mental illness.


Kidstime In Action
An account of a Kidstime Workshop Session
The day was excellent! The sessions are just getting better and better!
We are getting to know each other and people are more comfortable and themselves.
As people arrive quiet music plays in the background. People help themselves to refreshments and write their names on the board in a coloured pen. Staff help everyone to arrive and settle.

At the beginning we played a few games, which worked really well!
In a circle with the ball going round saying our names and our favourite foods.  This enabled them to step out of self-consciousness and find common interests.
Jo did an exercise with marbles, demonstrating how the build up of thoughts and worries can create a blockage system, making other thoughts not come through properly. Everyone had a marble and gave a worry to put in the cup.
Adults and children were so open with each other. The adults were interested to hear the kids’ worries as well as wanting to voice their own.
The children were getting restless so we spontaneously opted to do the drawing of the thoughts being voiced in the circle. – The kids became fully engrossed with what was being said and drawing it while spread out on the floor with big sheets of paper, working hard to make sure to get all the points down – these were ‘things you do to make you happy’. They voluntarily gave their drawings to the adults, who were very impressed. This led nicely onto the kids’ drama time, as they were already in that space.
We then split into a parents group and a children’s group with the adults going to a different room with Jo and the children staying with me to do drama games.
We played the game “What’s in it?” – This was an improvisation to guess what was in a fragile object using imagination, At first some children thought it was silly but then ideas started pouring out and they became immersed in the world together. This highlighted the importance of creating a space where kids can allow themselves to express emotions and reactions that may appear traditionally ‘silly’ or ‘wrong’ in other contexts.
We played ‘Musical Statues’- this was FANTASTIC!
Great moves and concentration to stay in the game – Through this game we saw some of the boy’s becoming engaged and they continued to play a positive affect on their behaviour and the group’s energy.  The group became really united after this.
We developed a play about zombies and someone running away. The story took the person running away to a ‘haven’ but then the zombies start breaking in. So she uses her magical power to shine them off and it works. Then they become their normal selves as if they were not aware what happened when they were zombies. We rehearsed this three times, refining ideas as we went along. It was fantastic. We bowed at the end to the camera.
This was all we had time for and was great in terms of using the time to set a structure of playing, making and filming. We got to explore ideas and practiced rehearsing a piece of drama and having fun and sharing ideas, allowing ourselves to be spontaneous but knowing the boundaries of respectful behaviour.
A ‘difficult’ child was on such good behaviour and he continued to engage by offering to help set up the film space and wanted us to tell his mum how well he’s been doing.
At the Pizza Time and Show and Share Time the kids willingly gave an intro to each section of their film clips whilst people ate pizza and applauded.
Teenagers Group
Topic Explored – Stigma
We took the teenagers in a different space– their main activity was ‘What is stigma to you?’ which they explored through drawing and afterwards, explaining to the group what they’d done.
They did not want to show their video so we saw what they produced and they explained it to everyone. People were amazed by the strong thoughts the drawings contained. We were really happy to use the talents of the young people to create the visuals. The exercise revealed thoughts and feelings on their experience and understanding of stigma.

Conclusion
Overall it was a great day! Where clear progression was made. The challenging behaviour from a few children was dealt with by one -to – one engagement and this has helped those children to be a lot calmer and focused. They became more engaged in group conversations and were able to share their body map drawing. Their influence on each other and self-awareness has increased and they are  becoming aware of the value of positive behaviours and communication in the sessions. It is touching to see that once they begin to recognise their strengths and abilities they want to share these with their parents and have them acknowledged.
We finished with the kids saying they don’t want to take a break for summer holidays.  It felt as though the adults had been inspired by the kids’ way of being – there is a sense of greater consciousness and appreciation with praise growing in the room.

Ambeya on winning “Young Student Volunteer” at the Westminster Community Awards

 
I do not do what I do for appreciation or recognition, but when I find myself being celebrated in an award ceremony like this, where the Lord Mayor of Westminster, the Director of Communities and Chief Executives, are congratulating me for the time and dedication I give to Kidstime, it made me realise that it isn’t officials or leaders who create change, it’s those of us who belong to communities who make things happen and who make a difference.
Of course, I appreciate the recognition and support which this award represents and it helps me to have the courage and energy to keep going. Having heard important people, who were complete strangers to me before this ceremony, list all the work I have been doing for young people, especially young carers who care for parents with severe mental illnesses, I felt overwhelmed, but it also felt really good, to hear back the amount of work I have managed to complete in such a short amount of time.
There has always been a stigma attached to mental illness and most people do not want to think about such sad and difficult things. As a result, you become oblivious to the issues which arise in families where mental illnesses exist. Children who have one or more parents with a serious mental illness will have experienced many traumatic situations throughout their childhood and unless they are helped early, the consequence on their mental and physical health is serious and permanent (Adverse Childhood Events research). Parental mental illness is not a small problem. In terms of numbers, an estimated that about 2 million children are affected and it is a root cause of many of the mental health problems which affect children and young people.  However, by providing appropriate and early support for the family and in school, we can protect our children from following in their parents’ footsteps.
At Kidstime, this is what we are about and the message we want to share is that you can prevent the cycle of mental illness.
I feel both glad and grateful that the work of Kidstime, and the work for which I have received this award, is now finally being recognised in Westminster. I hope that such recognition opens up doors for conversations in other areas and increases the emphasis on how important it is to hear from the voices of the unheard and unseen – from children of parents with mental illness whose voices are silenced through stigma and shame. I have taken a personal stand to speak up for those children, as no one spoke up for me whilst I was growing up.
It isn’t fair for children to live their lives as victims of society’s inability to see mental illness as an illness like any other. It is not something we can hide and it is not fair to expect a child to parent their own parent. It certainly isn’t fair not to allow young people to voice their opinions on the things which they experience and which matter the most to them.
Receiving this award has taught me one thing. You don’t need to think of grand plans and big ideas which take ages to put in place or are too ambitious to even consider. This is a way of not doing anything. It really is the little things that make the difference. It is all the little things that I and others in Kidstime have been doing that have made a change to children’s lives, maybe even saving lives.
I am delighted to be part of a movement that campaigns and helps the children of parents with a mental illness; to get the attention that it should and allows charities like Kidstime to move forward and in the right direction, towards a recognition of the problem and the funding of the solutions to enable all affected children to benefit.
Building Communities – For Carers Week 2017

Everything we do here at the Kidstime Foundation, whether it is working with families, schools or lobbying the government, is working to build a community around the child who has a parent with a mental illness.
We know that without a supportive network 70% of these children will go on to have some level of emotional, cognitive or social difficulties and high levels of subsequent depression. The key to unlocking this network is to enable the discussion about mental illness to come out into the open.
At Kidstime we reduce the fear of stigmatization by:
• Providing them with a fun and supportive ‘break’ from the everyday challenges that they face
• Enabling them to build positive relationships both within their family and with their peers/others that have similar lived experience
• Giving them a voice, empowering them through drama, film and creative activities and peer-to-peer confidence building to express their needs, wishes and aspirations
• By providing appropriate ‘role models’, including ex-service users, build self-belief and positive life expectations.
The impact of a community that is open to the issues they are facing is clear when you talk to those that attend our projects:
“I love talking about mental illness because it made me understand more about what it is and how it can affect people, like my mum … I realised I wasn’t the only child with that sort of problem, and that other kids felt the same. This and someone asking me how I felt, made me believe in myself and feel more confident.” Young carer
“Coming [to Kidstime] has enabled her to see that others are in similar situations and, although we have problems, we are working through them. That has given her confidence and now she is blossoming.’ Parent
“I used to think that I was nobody, but it’s like Who Cares? has given me a voice and that sharing my experience can help others. Me and my dad have a future. The world is no longer such as dark and frightening place. I feel that the Who Cares? Project has saved my life.” Young Carer

The Hidden Issue

My name is Matthew, I am 14 years old and I live with my Mum and Dad and little sister. I am in Year 10 and I like school but I find it hard to make friends because I don’t have time to do things with them and I don’t want to bring friends home because my house is very messy and my Dad is a bit unpredictable. He has a mental illness, you see and that means that he often sleeps during the day and my Mum works all the time, she has to do that because Dad cant work. I love my parents but I also feel responsible for them, Mum does her best but she can’t do everything. I do most of the housework and shopping and sometimes I do the cooking but I am not very good at it and my sister is too young. I enjoy being helpful and grown up but it does get me down at times.
Things have improved lately because one of the teachers has taken an interest and asked me how things were at home. I felt better once I told him and I know he understands and will speak up for me if I get into trouble with homework and sometimes I am late for school because things are difficult at home. He talked to me about the need to look after myself, to have a hobby, to go out with friends so that I can deal with the stress. I know this is good advice but it’s hard to make time for myself.
Recently we had an assembly on mental health and it was interesting to understand what mental illness is and how it happens. I realised that it’s not that different from having a physical illness but it’s much harder to talk about mental illness because people call you names. I worry that I will have a mental problem just like my Dad but maybe I can avoid it, that’s what the teacher said, he said it was not true that if Dad has a mental illness I will have it too. I am really interested in the brain and how it works and I hope to find out more in the Carers Group that the school has started. At least I don’t feel so odd any more.

Helping Children Who Have a Parent with a Mental Illness to Thrive in Schools.

Being a young carer or coping with a parent or sibling with a mental illness will have a significant impact on a young person’s school life – both the academic and the social aspects. In the long term this has been shown to significantly affect a person’s life chances. Young people often tell us how having a parent who is mentally ill was missed or misunderstood by teachers, in both primary and secondary school. School staff can be alert to signs such as lots of unexplained absences, lateness, problems completing homework, having the correct uniform or kit, parents not being able to attend meetings, tiredness, distraction and signs of anxiety.
A school that is understanding and responsive can do a great deal to help. It is crucial that the whole school has a positive ethos about mental health and an openness to talking about mental illness. This is beneficial for all children and staff, not just carers and the children who have a parent with a mental illness. Being open about the problem helps to reduce the stigma and isolation experienced by the children and reduces the risk of bullying. We have been working with this issue through The Kidstime Who Cares? programme which has given us the perfect vehicle for addressing the problem, not simply being aware of it, although that is the first step. The Who Cares? Programme has given us the confidence and skills to support the children and has been positively received by students and staff.
We have used Assemblies to raise awareness and to allow the affected children/young people to identify themselves and get the support they need. This has been a vital part of addressing the problem as young people often think their situation is normal or not worthy of attention. It also raises awareness in the wider school community, and working with the issue has had the further advantage of building understanding and empathy across the whole year group and the school community.
Young Carers groups who are attuned to the issue of parental mental illness have proved to be a significant support.  Here is what young people tell us about their school’s young carers group:
‘It’s really awesome – to do things that normal kids do and to chill out and not be judged by anyone. The fact that I’m getting remembered is really cool and they know I’m there.’
‘It’s also having the time – it’s at the beginning of the week so anything that’s gone on at the weekend we can talk about. It helps with people’s mindsets, with stress, it’s not just about having fun. Other groups you feel you’ve got to go but this one doesn’t feel like that. If I can’t face people I don’t have to go.’
Young Carers develop many strengths and skills, are excellent at supporting one another and in devising the support they need in school. It can be as simple as providing a quiet room with a sofa. Schools being willing to listen and respond can be transformative.

Perinatal Mental Health Awareness Week
Having a baby is a life changing experience, both exciting and terrifying at the same time. All parents know that it puts enormous pressure on the couple, the family and the mother in particular. The stresses and strains involved in having a baby can sometimes precipitate mental illness.
Mothers who have a mental illness can often feel ashamed and worried about the effects on their child but the most important thing to remember is you are not alone. Removing the stigma to allow those who are ill and their families to talk about it and get help is essential to recovery and ensuring everyone in the family is thriving.
At Kidstime we have been working with families affected by parental mental illness for 16 years and we have developed the Kidstime Workshops to support the whole family based on our knowledge and research:

talking about it helps
knowing you are not alone, being in a group where you feel safe to disclose your fears
having a good explanation from a knowledgeable, sympathetic professional

Key Points to remember
Removing the stigma, there is nothing to be ashamed about, you are not alone
Being able to talk about it, finding a safe place and trusted adults who share your experience
If it happens tell someone and get help, don’t suffer in silence, there is help available
There is no shame in having a mental illness but we as a society should be ashamed if we allow those who are suffering and their families to remain hidden from support.

A Teacher’s Perspective…
When I first met Ambeya in 2005, I was a Newly Qualified teacher, aged 23, working in an inner-city London comprehensive. I had completed my training in 2 similar schools, but perhaps nothing prepares you for that first year of teaching in a school where many young people face such a multitude of personal and social challenges.
Ambeya, aged 12, was as she is now: inspiring and resilient. She continues to be one of the most impressive and strong people I have ever met. She is completely self-made, despite facing so many difficult circumstances at home – she continued to try hard in every subject, ace her exams, be kind to everyone around her and completely thrived at school. I used to ask myself regularly, how she achieved this, when dealing with so much outside of school.
It’s taken me 12 years, but I realise that all she needed was a pair of willing ears. She needed someone to listen. I would love to take some credit for her academic and personal successes, but the truth is, all I think I did, was allow her to speak freely and listen to her. She did everything else for herself.
I had no training in the consequences of having a parent/carer with mental health problems on young people, and I had no real experience of young people from these background  – until I met Ambeya.
However, I believe that through talking, you can knock down walls, and through listening, you can perhaps build new foundations – strong blocks, that are not excluding or protectionist, but foundations that help young people to feel more confident about their lives and futures.
If Kidstime had existed in our area and at our school 12 years ago, and I had known about it, I would have loved to have helped Ambeya meet others who had similar experiences to her. I also wish we could have had whole school training about this topic and how to further support children like Ambeya. I was able to listen and try to empathise, but I could never fully understand how she felt. It would have been wonderful to see her build relationships with others – who had also lived through her experiences and could share her story. And I would have loved to have seen our school work with all staff and pupils to break down barriers, like stigma, to support.
Ambeya and her teacher reconnected after we ran her story in our social media campaign ‘Helping kids #BeKidsAgain’. It has been amazing to hear how much this relationship has affected each of them and to know that even something as simple as having someone to talk to, can have such a big impact.
Ambeya will be taking part in a sponsored trek across the Sahara Desert in the autumn for Kidstime. She is taking on this once in a lifetime challenge to help promote the work of Kidstime to help other children like her have access to support. In order to do this, she must raise a minimum of £2000. Any amount would be appreciated!

So, what’s the point of drama in Kidstime Workshops?

 Wirral Kidstime tells us about the drama in their sessions.
The core philosophy of Kidstime is that children’s resilience to parental mental illness is improved and vulnerability lessened when they have an understanding of their parent’s mental illness, can discuss it with a sympathetic adult and feel their experiences validated by the group.
Kidstime does this in several ways; the use of drama techniques in the warm up session encourages families to interact playfully as a family.  It can be daunting coming into the group, and often in Wirral Kidstime some of the adult and child participants begin by feeling anxious or uncomfortable in the group, we frequently start sessions with an adult sitting outside the group or a child may hide behind their parents or the long curtains.  Families where a parent is struggling with their mental health are often isolated in the community and when they start Kidstime they often sit on the edge. The drama games to break the ice at the beginning of the session are vital to establish a sense of fun, group safety and acceptance.
After working together on a topic that explains some aspect of the experience of living with a parent with a mental illness we split into separate child and adult groups. Much helpful work in developing a drama or dance in the children’s group starts by working up the drama, in the planning stage. Children’s ideas and thoughts are sought and this allows for the children to talk about their experiences as they plan the drama. When they understand that they are not alone because other children have experienced the same thing their experiences are made valid. This is an important technique to help them process, think about and verbalise traumatic experiences and ways to cope.
Performing the drama is a process of finding words and bodily expression to express, communicate and think about the subjects tackled. The group builds confidence as the drama or dances are always responded to with pride and enjoyment.
But most of all its energetic, active fun!
 ‘Kidstime takes action on helping us learn about mental health in really fun ways. We use a lot of drama to help us figure out our own thoughts and feelings about our parent’s difficulty. This makes it easier for us to express things in a way that is interesting and easy to understand. Kidstime is never boring!’
‘We normally start our group activity with lots of fun games and warm-up exercises. We then make up stories together that describe all our different experiences. We act these out and film some of them so that we can show our parents how we feel about the topic we have been working on.’

Reasons why I stand up for the rights of children who have a parent with a mental illness.
Life is tough for parents with a mental illness – but it’s also tough for their children.
It is impossible to make this issue go away so I feel it is my duty to raise awareness so they get the support they need to help them get through it.
I want to do my bit and help these vulnerable children and young people protect themselves from the negative effects of living with, and sometimes caring for, a parent with mental illness.
I have met kids from the age of 3 who are caring for their parent. No child should be forced to become an adult from such a young age.
These children don’t deserve to lose out on their childhood and parent their own parents. Just because you can’t see it like physical illnesses, doesn’t mean it’s nonexistent.
These children have become isolated from a society where a mental illness is seen as a taboo or their caring responsibilities do not fit the attributes of a ‘normal kid.’ These children have to deal with the difficulties and heartaches on their own because they feel embarrassed to speak up – I take it as an obligation to be the voice that speaks for them.
When you feel like there is no one to turn to for help, these children can be left with no choice but to take over the parent role and keep everyone safe; sometimes tolerating verbal abuse and extreme and/or aggressive behaviour. This shouldn’t be allowed.
I believed it was my duty to remain strong and reliable for everyone in my life and that I couldn’t let them see the messed up person that goes into hiding.
For those who know me for my stubbornness, I would still like to believe I am superwoman. Which is why, I take it as an obligation to prevent others from experiencing a tough childhood like me; creating the change that these young people are wishing will happen.
Life has been a rollercoaster for me. But, over the years, I have learnt how to manage sometimes life threatening situations. Being a carer has now become part of who I am and I’ve been able to find ways to deal with it on a day to day basis.
If Kidstime was available to me when I was younger, life would have been so much easier for me. I wouldn’t have had to learn about my role as a carer or study mental illnesses through Google. I wouldn’t have had to try to manage everything when someone else could have taken that pressure off me. Maybe, I would have even learnt how to build up the courage to ask for and take help; something which I still struggle to do.
Children who have a parent with a mental illness need the support and resources to better manage their roles at home; building resilience and confidence along the way in order to help them build a brighter future for themselves.
I know there are so many other kids out there who could be in the same situation as me. They avoid asking for help or even acknowledging that they care for someone. They are unable to confront their fears and it hurts to know that they have to deal with it on their own; just like I had to do.
I always thought I was the only one but when I got involved with Kidstime, I see so many children in the same boat. I would like to see all the kids in this situation learn that you can look after your own emotions as well as coping with mental illness, as a family.
Investing in young people’s physical and mental health shouldn’t  just be a moral imperative, but will prevent problems occurring later in life which may need more intensive and expensive support.
I’ve never really had dreams before – but being a part of Kidstime has allowed me to start dreaming. And I do dream that one day, the words ‘young carer,’ ‘mental illness,’ and other word which carry such stigma – are used as words to describe achievements, as positive challenges and something recognised for the right reasons. Because right now, it feels like we are so far away from achieving that.

I will be taking part in a sponsored trek across the Sahara Desert in the autumn for Kidstime. I am taking on this once in a lifetime challenge to continue to raise support and awareness for these children and the work that Kidstime do and I would love for you all to feel the passion and energy that I feel. In order to do this, I must raise a minimum of £2000. Any amount would be appreciated and your support will carry on driving my commitment!

The impact of Who Cares? In schools.
Joel Archibald, 16
Joel cares for his father, who has physical and mental health problems.
Through the Who Cares? Project in school, I now recognise myself as a young carer, and that 
there are others like me.  
My peers in class now understand what my life is like, and why I am sometimes worried… I used to think that I was nobody, but it’s like Who Cares? has given me a voice and that sharing my experience can help others. 
Me and my dad have a future. The world is no longer such as dark and frightening place. I feel that the Who Cares? Project has saved my life.
I was 13 when Dad got ill he had depression and chronic heart disease, and loads of other things. I had to cook every night do dishes, clean up – everything I thought Dad would do. It wasn’t so bad that I couldn’t bear it but I wasn’t able to concentrate on school work and had really bad grades in English and maths.
It was complicated in the beginning because no one knew that l was a carer.
Until I saw the Who Cares? film I felt isolated. I didn’t have any school friends, I was on my own everyday. Sometimes l wouldn’t go home until seven or eight because I didn’t want to. But that has all changed because l have opened up and told my stories.
After I did this even others in my class changed their way of acting. It has helped me to talk. It was easier to talk to a group than one-to-one. Now it’s better and easier, but my Dad  won’t get better. It will be like this until I leave home.
There are good days and bad days. Dad doesn’t see himself as ill he is always going to be stuck with it but l find it easier to cope now. And my grades have picked up. I have now heard of people having the same or worse problems but never met them face to face.
My advice to anyone in the same boat is to speak to someone before it’s too late. When you are in the situation you feel isolated and don’t want to speak to anyone because you feel no one will help and you think you are the only one with those problems. Speak to a family member you can trust or a teacher or a friend you can trust. Us young people don’t get enough information about this. The authorities don’t really know how we feel. They should come and talk to people like us. Posters and books could help to inform and help us. Kidstime and Who Cares? are doing that.
It’s nice to see someone in your situation and watch what they do. When I saw the first Kidstime Who Cares? film. I thought that was me. That’s what I’m hoping this film will achieve with others.

“I realised why Mum was different and that I had nothing to be ashamed of.”
  Chineye Njuoku, 27 attended Kidstime from the ages of 13 to 17.
 
 
She is now a trustee and ‘experience counsellor’ with the charity and is pioneering a TeenTalk programme for adolescents. She is a Psychological wellbeing practitioner and a cognitive behaviour therapist in training for IAPT.
My mum had postnatal depression when I was born and is also bipolar, so I’ve always known mental illness. When I was two years old, I was sent to Nigeria with my elder sister Sabrina and we stayed there, living with my father’s family for the following seven years. My mother remained in the UK and we would talk on the phone, but I remember her sounding strange and relatives would talk about her having “a madness”.
We were reunited when I returned to the UK at the age of nine. I had imagined that we would hug and kiss, but she was withdrawn and I now understand that she was numbed by her medication. She still wasn’t well enough to look after us so I was sent to an aunt’s. At school I did well academically, but I couldn’t relate to other students. A teacher took me under her wing and, gradually, I told her what was going on and she encouraged me to make friends.
By my early teens, our parents had divorced but Mum was well enough for Sabrina and I to live with her. It didn’t all go smoothly. She would have relapses and we would be sent to stay with relatives and went into foster care for a period.
I first became involved in Kidstime through social services. Alan [Dr Cooklin] was the first person to describe my mum’s illness clearly to me. I realised why she was different and that I had nothing to be ashamed of. I also met other children with the same problems and that made me feel that we weren’t abnormal.
At home, I had to behave like an adult; most of the time we couldn’t run around or make a lot of noise and we had to always make sure Mum was ok. Kidstime was the one place I could be a child – I could play, have fun and laugh for a couple of hours and I really needed that.
In my mid-teens I went through some bullying problems that led to rebellion. I stopped taking my education seriously and bunked off school. I had been in the top set, but went down to foundation level. My English teacher picked up on it, talked to me and made me realise that I did care about being successful. I knuckled down and went to university, where I graduated in biomedical science before doing a master’s in psychological therapies. I now work in mental health.
Mum’s health is still up and down, but we are doing ok. Two things have got me to where I am: Kidstime and my teachers. That’s why I am so keen to see Who Cares? in schools. With the right information and support, teachers have the power to make a difference to children like me.

 
Who cares? We do
Offering effective support to children of parents with a mental illness is vital for good health outcomes. Jess Streeting describes an inspiring project at the Kidstime Foundation which does just that, working with school children to improve their resilience.
People are not always aware of the distinct role of the school nurse. In essence, we take over where health visitors finish, promoting the health and well-being of the school aged population, aged from five to 19 years old. We work closely with schools, children and young people and their families, helping to lower barriers to learning and supporting young people to navigate the path to health.
Our work is fascinating, fun and challenging. At present there are fewer than 1,400 qualified school nurses in the country.
Introducing Who Cares?
On project, very dear to my heart, is the Who Cares? project at The Kidstime Foundation. The project was founded by Dr Alan Cooklin and offers information, resources and support to children and young people who care for, or are affected by, a parent or sibling’s mental illness. Kidstime focuses on improving the child’s resilience through engaging him/her in explanation which can make sense of their parent’s less rational behaviour.
I first became involved with Who Cares? when piloting a project as a full-time school nurse in one diverse, high need London secondary school. There we ran a young carers’ group, specifically for young people who have a parent with mental illness. The group, facilitated by two family therapists and very much led by the young people themselves, had the full backing of school and governors, who demonstrated unusual insight into this often-overlooked group.
With the support of The Kidstime Foundation, we made a film about the impact of having a parent with mental illness. Many of the young carers took starring roles in the film, which features a boy called Jas who is struggling to get homework in, be on time for school and care for his sister, whilst keeping up appearances at school. Jas is also getting teased by peers and when he retaliates at comments about his mum, his teachers are puzzled at his uncharacteristically volatile behaviour.
As well as outbursts of anger, teachers have noticed that Jas seems withdrawn and disengaged in class.
You can watch the film which also contains comment from teachers, support workers at school and Jas’s little sister, who is a bystander at the fight, elsewhere on the Kidstime Foundation website.
Children take the lead
This was our first film for Who Cares?, although Kidstime has been using drama and film workshops as part of their work with families for several years. Who Cares? is distinct from the other elements of Kidstime because it is a school-based project. Working within the school environment has many advantages, not least the potential to reduce stigma based on misconception around mental illness, in the whole school community. Interestingly, the young carers had wanted to call this part of the charity ‘mental’, as a direct challenge to this stigma. It was adults who struggled with this title, particularly when we were looking for funding support from larger professional bodies. Who Cares? was the children’s imaginative, if pragmatic alternative. From the initial success of this film, ideas flowed, the best often generated by the children.
For every 1,000 children and young people aged between five to 18 there are between 110 and 220 whose lives are affected by parental mental illness, but like Jas in our film, these children can be hard to identify. Referred to as ‘the invisible dimension’ in some studies, they may present at school with deteriorating attendance, low level behaviour issues, or unwillingness to participate in afterschool clubs or plays, because they have commitments at home which they do not feel they can share and responsibility more burdensome than their peers. Having a parent with a mental rather than a physical illness can carry additional strains for the child or young person, which can set them apart from other young carers.
Supporting COPMI
International research concurs that these children (sometimes known by the acronym ‘COPMI, meaning children of parents with mental illness), need support in three key areas:

interventions to diminish social isolation
access to a neutral adult to listen and act as advocate
explanation of their parents’ illness with opportunity to address their concerns.

Although COPMI is an Australia-based initiative, their research shows their work crosses boundaries as well as the globe, with their resources now increasingly adopted throughout the UK. One of their statistics highlights the importance of this work: the risk of developing mental disorders for children whose parents have a mental illness ranges from 41% to 77% (see Further information box for website details).
The Who Cares? project is able to address these needs by working closely to individual schools’ requirements, with a flexible programme of training from skilled worker, informed in large part by the children identified in the early stages of the programme. For example, one marvellous school in Plymouth, Stoke Damerel Community College has embraced the project and made it their own. In February 2014, despite extreme adverse weather conditions in the West Country, huge numbers of diverse professionals attended our initial awareness raising conference. With our tailored support, this school went on to establish a young carers’ group and through cross-curricular work in school, other young people came forward, recognising themselves as in need. In some cases, the school had been completely unaware of the home situation for their students. Finding a voice has transformed these children’s lives and they are now strong ambassadors for the work of Who Cares?, as well as keen critics of anything they feel to be disingenuous or unhelpful.
The importance of good communication




‘No one ever sat down and explained to me and my brother what manic depression was. It would have helped’ 
Young carer, The Children’s Society




I use this quote to illustrate the importance that children receive an explanation of mental illness; what it is, why their parent might be unwell and most significantly addressing the fear that they might ’catch it’. A clear explanation can also meet the specific need for children to make sense of their parents’ illness, to help the child associate the illness with a set of neurophysiological processes, rather than just the parent’s emotional responses. This strengthens a child’s resilience. Explaining might also encourage a child to start to trust, which can mean they disclose more therapeutic need.
The good news is that helping is not so difficult; initially children are not asking for specialist counselling support, rather a neutral, listening adult who ‘gets it’, who they can turn to at school on bad days and ask to act as their advocate where necessary. Our training materials can empower whole school communities to understand more about the impact of parental mental illness as well as giving individuals the confidence to be that vital support.
For me this has been the most illuminating aspect; learning that we don’t have to be psychiatrists or experts to talk to young people about mental illness. Often they are the ‘experts’ in their parent’s condition, but no one has thought to consult them.
Asking the right questions
Before I was involved in the Who Cares? pilot, I remember feeling at a loss to know how to help such children. I wrote in my diary:
‘Home. Watching my own kids safe in front of the telly after supper, I wonder how little Paul is tonight. His mum is mentally ill with a chronic condition that seems untreatable and the bullies are looming, press-ganging him into doing stuff he shouldn’t, late at night, out on the streets. He is such an easy target. The big boys won’t lay off him, when all he has to stand up for him on the estate are a vulnerable mum and two little sisters. How to ascertain his health needs? Is he in danger? I got nowhere today, but I think I asked the wrong questions.’
The boy I was writing about, Paul, spiraled fast, away from the protection of mainstream school and into the less tender embrace of the criminal justice system. I had not asked the right questions. None of us had. Maybe I would do better now. Maybe I would know that Paul needed fewer questions and more empathetic listening.
Several of the early ‘Who Cares? COPMI pioneers are now working in some capacity for the Kidstime Foundation. I would like, finally, to draw your attention to Ambeya and Kirsty, both young carers, who are both now at university. You may wish to read about them on the Kidstime website or (shameless plug here!) to sponsor them in their fundraising endeavours for the Foundation. Kirsty completed a 10k run and Ambeya has already walked the Great Wall of China and this year is trekking the Sahara. These young people do not want our pity, but they do deserve our boundless admiration.
Ambeya and Kirsty symbolise what can be achieved, if only children receive the right level of support and are listened to. I believe Who Cares? is a great example of a project which can reach out to other COPMI children and really make a difference. I hope this might inspire you to find new and innovative ways to do the same.

5 reasons why learning about my Dad’s mental illness really helped me…
1. Learning more about a parent’s mental illness helps you know what to expect because you’re often scared of what you don’t know.
The nature of mental health problems are often that they are confusing and unpredictable and this is especially true for people with bipolar, like my Dad. We never knew when his next low or, even more scary, next high would be. As I was young, most people wanted to ‘protect’ me from my Dad’s illness which in reality meant telling us that he had a serious condition but not to worry about it – yeah right! This provoked a lot of anxiety for me about how to predict my Dad’s mental state from his behaviour, something I have since learned is rather unhelpful and just makes things worse. Learning about my Dad’s condition really helped me to relax and accept that you just had to go with the flow. I was taught ways of dealing with it if he did become ill, like who to tell and who to get help from and most importantly techniques to help him feel better more generally, after all – all you really want in that moment is to help your parent feel better. I did also learn, from professionals, what things were strong signs of him getting worse. This made me feel much more in control and allowed me to realise when it was worth worrying about whether he was becoming ill; meaning I spent a lot less time worrying about and freaking out over really small, insignificant signs. It really is the oldest trick in the book, learning what to expect means you feel more prepared and confident in handling the situation. Having an explanation made me feel more removed from the illness.
2. Learning more about a parent’s mental illness breaks the silence and stigma.
People don’t talk about mental health problems – it’s all very hush hush. We all just pretend it isn’t happening as this is much more comfortable than having conversations about them and sharing experiences. Well, for a child living with a parent with a mental illness, or anyone living with such a person, it is simply impossible to sweep it under the rug. It is blatantly obvious, yet your parent’s natural protective instincts and the deep rooted stigma in society teaches you to avoid the topic. Going to Kidstime and learning about my Dad’s mental illness reversed all of this with a simple conversation. It lifted the heavy burden of embarrassment from my shoulders and made me feel much more comfortable talking about it with other people – whether they liked it or not. It got rid of any myths I had picked up about mental illness, like it was shameful to have mental health problems or not be able to work etc. because you learn that this is natural and understandable. This made me feel much better and less embarrassed.
3. Learning more about a parent’s mental illness is a form of recognition.
When you are a young person caring for a parent with a mental illness you can feel lost and confused about your place in the system that is designed to help your parent. On the one hand the adult mental health professionals frequently depend on their patient’s child, regardless of age, for detailed information regarding their parent’s behaviour and medication e.g. drug names and recent doses. But on the other hand you could think that professionals were actually unaware of these children’s caring role because when it comes to support for them there is next to nothing, particularly for children of mentally ill parents. Learning about my Dad’s mental illness finally made me feel like this caring role, that I was very aware of doing, was being respected. I was being given the recognition I deserved. I dealt a lot with my Dad’s doctors etc. and even after disclosing really distressing information to them about my dad I was never asked how I felt about it, so the contradiction was painfully apparent for me. Being given somewhere to go to learn about my dad’s condition and difficulties was a real relief for me – it felt like a sign of respect or celebration of my hard work – hard work that I wouldn’t change or have anyone else do for the world.
4. Learning more about a parent’s mental illness can help children be more understanding of their parent’s difficulties, be more sympathetic and feel less to blame.
Despite caring very much for and loving my Dad his illness, and his resulting behaviours, led to me having some very complicated and conflicting emotions. Being acutely aware that your parent was less able to do what other parents could do or would excessively worry about something that your friend’s parent’s didn’t worry about – was inconvenient at the best of times, anger provoking at other times, and, at the worst times, left me feeling like I am the problem or to blame. Learning about my Dad’s mental illness gave me huge amounts more empathy for him. This was from being able to understand that he couldn’t help how he was feeling and that sometimes the behaviour he displayed was the last thing he actually wanted to. It also helped me realise that I was not causing him to be upset, or angry or quiet all day. I genuinely believed that I was to blame for his emotions when I was younger – but learning that the emotions were down to having a mental illness and learning why having a mental illness makes you feel a certain way took away this guilt. Feeling solely responsible for causing someone’s emotions is also difficult because you feel like you are also responsible for making them happy too. This means I could feel like a failure if I didn’t make him feel better. Learning about his illness made me able to feel less guilty when he was sad and I was able to relax more with the understanding that it wasn’t all in my control. This helped our relationship because I also knew that he wasn’t just mean or frustrating on purpose – it was his illness – and I didn’t feel bitter or angry at him for the things he wasn’t able to do. Being able to realise this at an early age definitely helped prevent this from affecting our relationship.  I didn’t blame my dad for his differences like I used to – I understood it was his illness.
5. Learning more about a parent’s mental illness means you can explain it to others too.
By being able to understand what was happening to my Dad, I could explain it to friends that might notice something was up without feeling embarrassed. Some of my friends had a lot of questions too once I actually spoke to them about it and it felt really good to be able to answer them. I feel like my friends/classmates were a lot more understanding and less likely to tease me about it if I was confident in explaining my Dad’s situation.

‘Kindness’ and what it means for children who have a parent with a mental illness
This week is Children’s Mental Health Week. The theme this year is “Kindness”.
Kindness (noun): The quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate
“Kindness can seem to be such a soft and woolly word, but it can have real meaning when applied to people experiencing prejudice, bigotry, and bullying – one person’s kindness can sometimes make the difference between a kind of hell and a sense of hope, and not being alone to face and challenge adversities.”
So what is kindness and how can we learn from the conversations about happiness this week? Our CEO, Dr Alan Cooklin has written a blog post on what kindness means for the children we work with who have a parent with a mental illness and the impact it can have on that child’s life.
This applies to all kinds of prejudice; race, gender, disabilities and the rest….but an often hidden prejudice is felt by the 2 million children who have a parent with a mental illness. Many isolate themselves, assuming (sometimes correctly) that none of their friends or school mates will understand.
And for those school friends it is not an easy job to understand unless they have had an opportunity to learn what mental illness is like, what it’s like to be the child of a parent with the illness, and how much some understanding (for which read kindness ) matters.
So why does it matter?
Because if your parent has a mental illness you may feel that you are drawn into his or her world or way of thinking, almost out of loyalty. It may seem so far away from what friends and school mates talk about that it can seem like another world. Then unkindness or bullying just confirms it and encourages you to stay alone and isolated.
If someone can understand in a kindly way, and break through your barrier of isolation it can make all the difference. From avoiding school – or at least avoiding all activities and people at school – to you being able to join in and feel part of a world that is not just centred around your parent’s illness. You can start to be a kid again.”
This blog post was written by Dr Alan Cooklin, CEO of Kidstime Foundation. Kidstime Foundation provides information, resources and support for families who care for, or are affected by, a parent or sibling’s mental illness. They also have a number of projects in schools around the country to raise awareness of the difficulties faced by these children and young people.
A Hidden Issue
‘I always thought I was the only one but when I go to Kidstime every month, I see so many children. I would like to see all the kids in this situation learn that you can look after your own emotions as well as coping with mental illness as a family.’ Young Carer.
A young carer is: ‘A child or young person under 18 who provides regular and on-going care and emotional support to a family member who has a physical or mental illness, disability or misuses substances’. ADASS, ADCS, The Children’s Society 2012.
Children who have a parent with a mental illness might not be identified as a young carer. They might not meet the criteria of doing a caring role. Maybe there is another parent or family member seen as the main carer for their parent. That person might even be an older sibling.
They may never have thought of themselves as a young carer, or heard the term before.
They might not think it applies to them because they don’t do any more at home than you usually would. They’re not doing more housework or cooking or helping a parent get washed or dressed etc. Or it might be that their parent or another family member would be embarrassed if they or someone else thought of them doing things which is an adult’s job.
Or they might just think that loving, caring or helping your parent is not something as officially as ‘being their carer’. But being a young carer includes emotional support as well as caring duties.
It might also be that they themselves or family members treat their parent’s illness and the caring that they do for them as a ‘secret’. Because of the ongoing stigma and discrimination around mental illness the young person or their family may not wish to speak out about what it is happening at home.
‘…you can’t talk about it at school because you know it makes you different. But at Kidstime, children talk about mental health all the time so you can stop holding in your feelings. It’s comforting, and I felt more accepting of my dad.’ Young Carer.
Even if they don’t seem themselves as a young carer, if you know someone who has a parent with a mental illness that may mean they are doing some caring roles, whether this is practical or emotional. Speak up for those that are caring for a parent with a mental illness. #carersweek
 
The importance of Good Relationships when your dealing with a parent who has a mental illness.
It can be hard enough being a young person but having a parent with a mental illness can bring a lot of added stresses and pressures. Often this has happened when no one else even realises or acknowledges how much you are caring or doing. Also when you don’t have anyone you can talk to about what is happening at home and what is worrying and stressing you out, these pressures can seem really overwhelming.
This is made worse because it can be very difficult to talk to anyone else in an open way. In fact, it is still uncommon in general every day conversation for people to talk about mental illness, and what it is like.
Life at home may be so hard that you stop seeing your friends and having fun. Maybe you don’t want to bring friends over because your mum or dad isn’t feeling well. Or maybe you’re embarrassed by the state of your house, or by your mum or dad.
Having someone to talk to and developing good relationships are necessary and important to everyone. 
So what of relationships and with whom? Some young people think that relationships mean boyfriend or girlfriend. Of course they can be with anybody; good friends, relatives, adults you trust from school, clubs or others.
Why do they matter?  Good relationships – especially outside the immediate family can help you to think more independently, not to blame yourself, and not to fear that you have to follow your parents illness. It can be an uncle, aunt, a particular teacher or school nurse, family friend, cousin or any of your own friends. Another parent who is understanding and rather ‘neutral’ or a special brother or sister can help a lot too.
Taking some time for yourself with a friend or friends you can hang out with and just have fun, can help you to feel more relaxed and help you to feel good about yourself and your situation at home.
The people you have good relationships with can help you to challenge stigma, to stop letting you think badly of yourself, and research has shown that even if there is ‘illness in your family’ that good and supportive relationships can help you to be no more vulnerable than anyone else. So hurrah to good relationships!!
Thoughts on relationships when your parent has a mental illness:
Caring with a parent with a mental illness can have both a positive and negative effects. Even though it has given me the skills of being strongly independent, it has affected my relationships with others in various ways and you only begin to realise this once you start growing up and view things from a different perspective. Only till now, have I realised how important it is to have strong relationships with those around you.
The main relationship that has been affected is my relationship with my mum. It hurts to know that her mental illness is the reason why I will never be able to have a ‘normal’ mother/daughter relationship and there have been many times where the roles switched and felt like I was mothering her in ways a young carer would.
Relationships with extended family were affected too. They can be understanding at times, but when in need of desperate help, they too would not know how to react to the situation. Living in a household where a parent has a mental illness, extended family never really know what happens behind closed doors. It’s been over 14 years now – and they probably still don’t know. It affected my relationship with my younger cousins too. Being the eldest cousin from my mum’s side of the family, I felt like I was pushed away because my family circumstances were different. It didn’t help knowing that extended family only lived a few doors away.
But I still had my dad and my brothers. Obviously during times of major distress, we would always stick by each other and make sure everyone was safe. However, everyone deals with stress in his or her own way and the build up of stress was taken out amongst us, as there was no one else.
Then there is the relationship you have with friends. When I was younger, I was never able to take part in social activities. I had to stay at home and look after my siblings. As the years went by, I began taking part in social events once I began sixth form and during university. But when you are a carer, you never know what is going to happen next. You are always on the edge and there have been many times where I would organise events and then cancel them; or I would back out of outings because I would have a duty to go home. However stubborn I may be, I always needed to remind myself that if my own family can’t help me when I need them too, I have great friends who would pull themselves together and be mentally strong for me when I can’t cope myself. These are the relationships that have helped me get to where I am today.
Even though I have grown up to believe that being a young carer and asking for help is a burden on others, I now believe that sometimes it takes more than one person to help you get through tough times. The past is something that should always be forgotten, but I have experienced and learnt things, which many are still learning now.
You will always have positive and negative relationships in life and everyone experiences them. But, growing up as a carer, forming relationships will always be difficult due to the stigma attached to mental illness. The lack of attention to how children are affected by parental mental illness and the emotional and behavioural impacts this has, is still unheard. This has to change.
Ambeya, Young Carer.
“I was very reluctant to socialise with my friends due to the responsibilities I had as a carer. I would particularly make excuses to my friends, reasons why I could not meet up, when my mother was experiencing a relapse. I was worried that if I met up with my friends, I would disclose what was going on at home, which would make me feel vulnerable. I later discovered that engaging in my social and private leisure activities was important for my own wellbeing. Also, I learnt that I do not have to divulge personal information about what happens at home as I can always talk to my friends about other things. Nevertheless, the more I met up with my friends, the more I was able to discern who I felt more comfortable talking to about personal things. This made me feel like I was not alone.
I also found that developing a relationship with my mother was also very important for my wellbeing. It is so easy for her illness to create to barrier between the both of us. I respected the fact that she did not necessarily like to talk about her health with me. I therefore talked to her about other things and did other fun activities with her. This made me see her in a different light and strengthened my relationship with her.
I cherish my relationship with my mum, family and friends, partly because it is beneficial for my own mental health.”
 Chineye, young carer.
“Caring for someone with a mental illness has its forgettable effects. I experience worry while not being at home because of what may happen when I’m absent, this causes a strain on my friendships and I’m overall unreliable when it comes to schedules.
This is because mental illness is an on going rollercoaster of events and emotions that repels you from being in a social environment. Family members can be understanding but unwilling to co-operate causing distress when unable to seek help.
Patience is a skill that can never truly be mastered; it is difficult to know if a breakthrough exists. Although, I have become patient with others around me, understanding that negative events in social constructs can be dealt with patience.
Having this responsibility has given me the ability to persevere during relapses, problem solving emotional situations at its extremes, making it feel like basic relationships always have the capability to be restored with the right time and effort (from both parties).”
Angel, young carer, 18.
Have you heard of COPMI?
If you live in the UK you probably have not. That is because the UK government does not even recognise Children Of Parents with Mental Illness (COPMI). If you are a ‘COPMI’ and you live in Australia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland or Iceland you will be recognised and have services to support you. In the UK we do recognise Young Carers, and some of those are also COPMI, but the different estimates of young carers are still between 175,000 and 700,000 – while in the UK COPMI are estimated as 2,000,000!
Young Carers suffer from:

Missing school and lower educational attainment
They are more likely to have special educational problems
They often have lowered economic living standards in the family
They suffer higher levels of all kinds of illness themselves
They often suffer social isolation and sometimes depression
They often suffer bullying and stigma from their peers

Children Of Parents with Mental Illness also suffer:

Distress and confusion from the ill parent’s ‘ill’ thinking. They often feel that they should try to agree with their ill parent, even if what the ill parent says is very strange or upsetting.
They can feel great loss from feeling they have lost closeness with a parent they thought they knew before the illness. Sometimes they can get that closeness back but if the parent’s illness is very bad and continues for a long time they may feel like they have lost that parent.
They also may experience stigma and bullying, which may be worse if they also feel embarrassed about their parent or even about themselves.
They may be distressed and frightened by the side effects of their parent’s treatment, about which they may have had no warning. These include things like:


Sleeping much of the day
Becoming more withdrawn and detached
Suffering muscle stiffness or strange movements
Showing increased excitability or irritability with some drugs

So that is a lot to cope with, on top of which they may believe and fear that they are likely to develop the same illness – especially because many people carelessly and inaccurately say things like ‘It runs in families’.
So what of relationships and with whom? Many children of parents with mental illness can find relationships with friends and others of their own age to be difficult, and as a result may pull away from other young people. The difficulty they often have is that they can feel that their lives cannot be understood by others, they may feel too embarrassed by their ill parent to invite friends home, and sometime the ill parent may discourage much contact with outsiders of the family. Also sometimes they may be teased or bullied about their ill parent. Even with adults they may find it difficult to trust that they and their life will be understood. Finally they may also be shy and want to stay at home if they have felt very insecure during their early growing up.
Research has shown that even if there is ‘illness in a family’, good and supportive relationships can help these children to be no more vulnerable than anyone else. As highlighted by this year’s Mental Health Awareness week good relationships are fundamental to our health and wellbeing.

Kidstime Foundation launches the ‘Who Cares?’ Project
On 26 October 2015 we celebrated the launch of the ‘Who Cares?’ project at the Royal Society of Medicine. It has been an extraordinary success, with many guests and young people directly involved into the cause and in the event success!
 

 
The event included presentations by Dr Alan Cooklin (CEO) of the Foundation, by the team producing the materials led by Mark Ayres  of Team Media, as well as testimonials from young people aged 10 – 20, who have benefited from the Who Cares and Kidstime projects. There were also presentations by Jessica Streeting (school nurse and adviser to Public Health England), and Gemma Blackmore (head of health and Social Care at Stoke Damarel Community College in Plymouth) who has pioneered use of the project. 6 young people also performed a dramatic representation of using the project, supported by Deni Francis and others entertained the audience by singing and playing songs.
    


   Ade Adepitan, Olympic medalist from the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens and now TV presenter, is a patron of the Foundation, spoke and engaged the young people.
  Commentary came from Michael Allured, Policy Adviser at the Department for Education and Alastair Campbell – now a tireless fighter to improve mental health services – who gave an impassioned speech and blogged:

The stars of the show were the young people who spoke of how this tiny charity, operating in a tiny number of schools, had helped them. A young man from Plymouth, Joel, who said quite simply ‘Kidstime saved my life,’ helping not just him to understand the nature of his father’s illness, but helping his teachers and fellow pupils too…
Then there was a young woman called Kirsty, one of Kidstime’s earliest success stories, the daughter of two parents with severe mental health issues, now on her way to getting a degree, and full of confidence and inspiration as she spoke, family members watching on proudly…
But the quote of the night for me came from a young girl called Cacharel, aged ten or eleven, who lives at home with her often profoundly depressed mother and younger siblings: ‘I love talking about mental illness’.  Kidstime had given her permission to be open and frank about what she felt about her mother’s illness, and also to understand that just as she needed to give support to her family, she also knew there was support for her too.
..What we saw were young people who, given a little support, now have the confidence and the resilience they need to make something of their lives..
       
Alistair Burt, Minister of State at the Department of Health added:
  “This work comes at a great time for mental health. There is a cross-government effort under way and we are building on this momentum through our campaigns tackling stigma and tirelessly focussing on young people to help prevent these issues developing in the first place.
 “I want us to celebrate the incredible work of our frontline mental health staff and the achievements of organisations such as the Kidstime Foundation to make this the best generation for supporting people with mental health conditions, and their families.”

Check in to read what we’ve been up to recently.

 

June 2017
At the end of June we attended the Young Carers Festival that was celebrating it’s 18th year.
The festivities were well enjoyed by everyone who was there, especially the young people who have a fantastic opportunity for respite and fun.

We were also running a stall in The Voice Zone where we consulted with the Young Carers about how to manage transitions. Often when Young Carers reach the age of 18 they are faced with tough decisions about how best to move on from school and studies. This can be made even hard when you factor in their caring roles and managing family relationships, responsibilities and expectations. We spent the day asking them to think about how there are always positives and negatives about moving on. You may really miss something but also equally be happy to leave something behind. You may be very nervous about something but also very exciting about moving on to something new.
“It will be good to leave behind bullies and people I don’t like but I will miss our garden at home”
“I’m nervous about handing over responsibilities to my younger siblings but I am happy to leave behind our noisy neighbours!”
“I’m excited about being able to express my new independent self-taking care of me and my wellbeing for a change, but I am nervous about leaving my Dad behind as he is going through a tough time”
“I’m looking forward to new experiences and meeting new people but I will miss all the memories in my house”
“I will miss my friends and family but I am excited about using my experience of looking after my sister to my day to day life.”
 
We’re very grateful to the Young Carers Festival for inviting us and to all the young people we spoke to about managing all feelings, good or bad, when it comes to moving on.
Happy Birthday YCF!

May 2017
Visiting Plymouth
Dympna Cunnane (CEO) and Esther Malvern (Operations Director) took a trip to Plymouth to catch up with their Kidstime work. It was a real pleasure to see their Kidstime Workshop in action and meet with the families they have been supporting. A big thank you to all of the participants for letting us join in with their discussions, drama sessions and games. Esther in particular enjoyed creating clay characters with the children and acting out some scenes with them which we recorded and presented back to the parents.
We also had the opportunity to meet with teachers, pastoral teams and young carers services from across the area and present the Who Cares? work in schools to them. A very interesting discussion was had about how to empower school staff to help support children who have a parent with a mental illness and how, as a whole area, Plymouth can work co-operatively to spread the Kidstime work. We were both enthused and inspired by the work done in Plymouth and looking forward to returning in the autumn to do further school staff training and develop our Primary School material with the Plymouth Excellence Cluster.
 
Brand New Kidstime Workshops!
We’re delighted to announce that we have four new Kidstime Workshops up and running in Barnet, Westminster, Birmingham and Brent. You can find out more about them here. We look forward to returning to them in due course to pick up on their progress and share some of the learning with you. We are learning the importance of having a well trained and experienced core team to lead the workshops and we have produced online resources now which will guide the teams through the process from finding funding to starting working with the families.
We wish all four the very best with their groups and welcome them to the Kidstime Network.

 
April 2017
Last night Wirral Kidstime received a generous donation of sound and filming equipment from Round Table in Wirral. We meet at Pilgrim Street Art Centre in Birkenhead and as you can see in the photos the room is very large and quite echoey. Some of the softer spoken adults and children are difficult to hear when in such a large space and the sound quality of our playback equipment has been hard to hear. Roger Clay and Janey from Round Table gave Kidstime some brilliant new loudspeakers, microphones, an iPad to film the dramas and dances and 20 Wise Mouse books, which we can lend to families so they can use them to help explain parental Mental Illness to their children. They joined our discussion and film session at the end of Kidstime to donate them to us. Next month we should be able to start making use of them! Many thanks for Round Table in Wirral!


March 2017

Correspondence with the Prime Minister
In response to Prime Minister Theresa May announcement around mental health support earlier this year, we wrote to her to draw attention to the vulnerability of children of parents with mental illness and ask that the research and work we do at The Kidstime Foundation be included in the review. As you can see below from the response and our further correspondence we have been invited to be part of the Green Paper and have been connected with an MP in the Department of Education. Though we welcome this move forward and the interest in this vulnerable section of Society, it also underlines the neglect this group continues to suffer, indicates to us that the needs of this group clearly needs to be headlined more effectively.
We will, as ever, continue to push for these children to be identified and included in mental health policy as a separate group under Young Carers who suffer different adversities and require different support. We ask that policy makers and health, education and social care planners include this large group in their plans and budgets. The Kidstime Foundation have designed and delivered high quality and highly effective support services for these children and their families, which, if funded, would break the cycle and significantly save the public purse in the long term. It is time to be looking more closely at preventative measures to help protect children’s mental health and wellbeing.
 












February 2017
Who cares? Awareness Raising Events in Barnet.

This February we ran four events with 27 secondary schools in Barnet to raise awareness of Children of Parents with a Mental Illness and start to explore what they, as schools, can do to support them. The events were a great success and well attended by a range of roles from the schools including Heads of Years, Pastoral teams and Student Support Services.
The afternoon was very useful and enlightening.
Has made me really begin to think about what we can do in school
These sessions were run in partnership with Barnet Primary and Secondary Schools CAMHS at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust and Barnet Mind, who have also set up and are running a Kidstime Workshop for the Barnet area.
We are now working closely with a secondary school to develop a lead for the Barnet hub and a Sixth Form College to develop transition packages for young adults from schools to further education and employment.
Excellent introduction to a very wide ranging topic.
Very passionate speakers
Very relaxed, open discussions
We look forward to the Barnet Kidstime Forum event in the summer to check in with how schools are moving forward with their COPMI support and introducing Kidstime to Primary schools.
Thank you, this session was very useful and encouraging to know that support for this group of young people is finally being taken seriously
January 2017
Prime Minister unveils plans to transform Mental Health Support.
On Monday delivering the annual Charity Commission lecture, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a comprehensive package of measures to transform mental health support in our schools, workplaces and communities. The Prime Minister stated that true parity for mental and physical health can only be achieved if every institution recognises the vital role it can play in delivering this objective.


PM: “I want us to employ the power of government as a force for good to transform the way we deal with mental health problems right across society”
comprehensive package of reforms to improve mental health support at every stage of a person’s life – with an emphasis on early intervention for children and young people
new support for schools with every secondary school in the country to be offered mental health first aid training and new trials to look at how to strengthen the links between schools and local NHS mental health staff


The Kidstime response:
We welcome this renewed commitment by government to improve mental health services in general and those for children in particular. It is clear that early help makes economic and social sense but sadly to date at least another four such promises from the previous Secretary of State for Education (Nicky Morgan), the previous Prime Minister, have not delivered anything because there has been no investment to back up the promises. Mental health services for children have not been protected at the local level and there is evidence that some of the much needed funding has been diverted to other struggling services.
We also welcome that the Prime Minister wants to find out ‘what is and what is not working’. We look forward to hearing the detail of how this is to be studied and acted upon. The provision of mental health ‘first aid ‘ training is a move in the right direction but again it depends on how this is designed and delivered.
Our work at the Kidstime Foundation over the last 15 years shows that children and teachers would welcome this and we have developed training and resources for schools in our ‘Who cares?’ project. The tragedy is that we know what needs to be done and we have the means to do it but not the funding. Until this is forthcoming we will continue to have empty promises and we will have to pay for the damage later in terms of lost tax revenue, high costs for social support and NHS bills for acute treatment because prevention was not politically a priority.
Alan Cooklin, Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and CEO Kidstime Foundation

Wishing you all a very Happy Christmas!!
Thank you for all your support over this year and we look forward to you join us as we continue to support and raise awareness of children who have a parent with a mental illness in 2017.
October 2016
Ambeya completed a Sky Dive for Kidstime and World Mental Health Day!
   

What perfect timing it was to skydive for Kidstime – the day before World Mental Health Day 2016. Like my China Trek, words cannot fully express what it felt like to complete a skydive. It was simply incredible. From physically shaking whilst signing the declaration before the jump, to landing with the biggest smile on my face, it just goes to show how much and how quickly emotions can change. I can still remember anxiously watching the timer and seeing our altitude climbing knowing; that we were only 5000ft up and still had another 5000ft to go before jumping. If I have to be honest, the worst part (before I said that I loved it!) was when the door of the plane opened. The guy attached to me was on the edge of the plane – whilst I am already dangling in the air! Skydiving made me realise what it is like to put your full trust in someone with your life. But, I don’t want to put anyone off by saying all this.
After jumping out and freefalling for a good 30-40 seconds, it indeed feel like I was diving into the clouds. Feeling the clouds and water particles hit your face feels so refreshing; however grey the clouds look from down below. At least the sun was out when the parachute opened. And that’s when it actually hit me that I’m a few minutes away from completing a skydive. Being up there makes you forget about everything and everyone for a moment. It’s a moment truly to yourself. You have no cares in the world in that moment – all I could actually think about is how long it took for this day to come and how quickly it’s all going to end. The world looks so much nicer from above the ground we walk on. I’m a wimp when it comes go heights. But up there, height wasn’t even an issue. In my opinion, being on a rollercoaster is scarier.
I had the patience to wait over year and a half for an hour of what I could call the best hour of my life. It’s given me back the confidence I had lost and I could not have done it without everyone’s encouragement and support. Kidstime will always stay dear to me. Children affected by parental mental illness are still sometimes left in the dark and its through these crazy events that I organise that I can help raise awareness of the young people Kidstime help. Completing a skydive has always been something important to me; but to know that I have done it for a good cause makes the whole feeling 100x better. I hope one day, these young people are given the life and opportunities which they have wished to have for all these years. I hope me completing this skydive has helped raise further awareness of how we support children with parents with a mental illness. I hope one day, that like myself, everyone can turn around and say ‘Yes, I said I would and could do it, and now I’ve done it.’ Never let anyone stop you from living your life or doing something you’ve dreamed of doing. Because it’s that mentality and negative attitude that makes the work even harder for charities like Kidstime to deal with. Only joking. Kidstime will always be there to support you.
Now it’s time to plan my next adventure!

August 2016
Young People’s responses from the Young Carers Festival.
We’ve gone through all the responses from our stall at the Young Carers Festival and there are some consistent and strong messages from the young people that attended:
“caring is not easy but we want to do it”
“we don’t want sympathy but we do want support to deal with the issues”
” Mental Health is hidden and this makes it harder to deal with”
“we are not faking it and using it as an excuse to avoid things”
Thank you to everyone who took the time to meet with us and let us know their thoughts and feelings.
 
June 2016
The Kidstime Foundation at the Young Carers Festival 2016!
We went to the Young Carers Festival at YMCA Fairthorne Manor and met some amazing young carers. We had some great conversations about how to burst the bubble on being a young carer of a parent with a mental illness. We look forward to sharing here some of their thoughts and ideas.
     
 
This week is Carers Week, 6th – 12th June.

This year for Carers Week we are asking how can organisations build carer friendly communities.
With 1 in 6 pupils in a classroom affected by a parent with a mental illness what are schools doing to support them?
• The number of 5-7 year olds providing care increased by 83% between 2001 and 2011.
• 39% of young carers have said that nobody in their school was aware of their caring role.
• Only 36% of student carers felt able to balance commitments such as work, study, and family/relationships, compared to 53% of students without caring responsibilities.
Our Who Cares? programme can help to raise awareness of the needs of these children, tackle stigma and discrimination around mental illness and help these children come forward for support.
This Carers week we ask you to speak up for those that are caring for a parent with a mental illness.   #carersweek
‘…you can’t talk about it at school because you know it makes you different. But at Kidstime, children talk about mental health all the time so you can stop holding in your feelings. It’s comforting, and I felt more accepting of my dad.’  Young Carer.
May 2016
This week is Mental Health Awareness Week, 16th – 22nd May.
We’ll be adding posts all week about how relationships for young people can be affected when you are dealing with a parent with a mental illness and about how good relationships are essential to our wellbeing.
We need to understand just how fundamental relationships are to our health and wellbeing. We cannot flourish as individuals and communities without them. In fact, they are as vital as better-established lifestyle factors, such as eating well, exercising more and stopping smoking. – See more here at Mental Health Foundation’s website.

The Kidstime Foundation was featured in the BBC Three Counties radio programme – Shrink Wrapped.

Seasonal Greetings from The Kidstime Foundation

 
November 2015
The Mail on Sunday has published an article on the Kidstime Workshops.
Catherine O’Brien has written about the Kidstime Workshops for You Magazine and The Mail on Sunday. Highlighting a number of the families we are helping through the workshops and how the work of drama is helping to support them.
Mental health awareness may be on the rise, but for the children caught up in family illness, support can be sadly lacking. Catherine O’Brien meets the professionals breaking boundaries with open conversation and drama – and the families they are helping.
Terry, a former electronics engineer, first brought Drew to Kidstime two years ago, as he and his family (he also has three grown-up children) struggled to cope with the ill health of his wife Amanda, 50.

‘It’s hard for any kid to come out and say, “My mum or dad has gone off the rails,” so instead Drew was pushing herself into a corner and could no longer relate to her peers,’ says Terry.
‘But coming here has enabled her to see that others are in similar situations and, although we have problems, we are working through them.
‘That has given her confidence and now she is blossoming.’

Who Cares? Project: early positive feedback
A number of schools have now completed their piloting phase of Who Cares? Project and have made overwhelmingly positive comments about their experience.
From feedback reports schools sent us, after piloting Who Cares? Project between May and July 2015 we have discovered that:

Some students were initially scared as they recognised symptoms in their selves or their parents. But they felt relief when they found out that others felt the same and been through the same thing. Students understood others’ needs and there has been a noticeable change in atmosphere among students, towards empathy and understanding.
School staff felt that they have been educated too; they felt they can now sensitively support students and now they are more aware of the misconceptions of mental health
Schools have reported that the Who Cares? Project also improved the overall school atmosphere, with increased confidence in both affected children and peer group relationship across the school

Catrina Garratt – Head of Drama Stoke Damerel Community College – Plymouth said:
‘The Who Cares? Drama team wrote a play for Assemblies in school. The audience were so engaged and the focus so intense you could hear a pin drop. They really took in the message. By the end of the week over 600 people watched this student led work.
One young carer said: “I really enjoyed it. The Who Cares? Project has given me so much confidence and even made me want to carry on with directing and performing”. 
 
       
Great Success for Kidstime Foundation at the funding network event!
It has been a really interesting and successful evening: it kicked off with an ethical business debate and it carried on with several charities’ pitches about inspiring projects that asked for support.
Kidstime Foundation participated with a well-represented team; formed by professionals, school representatives, affected children and other stakeholders.
The Who Cares? Project touched the hearts of donors who very generous in supporting our cause.  The evening raised over £10,000 in grants!
Have a look to Kidstime Who Cares? Project pitch video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLzicNEZ91M
 
    
We would really like to thank all the people and organisations that contributed.  Their donations make it possible to run our projects in real schools, to help real kids.
Thanks also to The Funding network organisation for organising such a nice event!

 
Great Wall of China Trek
Young carer, Ambeya, walks the wall for Kidstime Foundation
          
“I have never imagined I’d have the opportunity to trek the Great Wall of China but to do it in order to raise money for the Kidstime Foundation was simply incredible. No words or pictures would be able to describe my experience there, but what I can say is that it will probably be one of the most rewarding and exciting things I have done in my life so far. Being able to experience a whole new country, culture and environment with a bunch of strangers I met at the airport for departure has turned my life around. I met some of the most amazing, inspiring people who I hope to organise more trekking adventures with. Being able to speak about the Kidstime Foundation and give a talk about the work we do for children looking after parents with a mental illness at the top of Great Wall gave me a spark of hope for the charity. I wish I could go back and do it all over again! I would like to thank everyone who supported me with my fundraising; especially Odeon Marble Arch for allowing me to hold fundraising events which made a huge success. This will not be the end of my adventures, it’s only just the beginning. I will carry on raising money for the Kidstime Foundation and make sure young carers have a better future ahead of them.”        
Ambeya
 
July 2015
Congratulations to Ambeya for reaching her fundraising target, and wishing her good luck on her forthcoming adventures!

Thank you to the schools who have begun working with us on our Who Cares? project piloting.
We are looking forward to expanding the project in September with more schools lined up to be involved.
 
 
 
April 2015
Our “Who Cares?” project is about to start piloting!
We are currently training teachers and school staff in different schools around the UK who will use the “Who Cares?” material to deliver the curriculum contents to their pupils.
Kidstime Workshops are expanding and we will soon be launching these workshops in new locations, both in the UK and abroad (Portugal)!
Our young carer Ambeya began her fundraising at the start of April, selling doughnuts at a stall at an Odeon Cinema, to raise money to support her walk along the Great Wall of China.
To find out more and support Ambeya, please go here



Why are you raising money for Kidstime Foundation?
“I have been a volunteer at the Kidstime Foundation for over a year now and recently they appointed me as a trustee. The charity is offered to children who have to look after parents with mental illness and find it difficult to come to terms with what they have to live with. This effects the relationships and bonds within the family and Kidstime try and explain to children what they are dealing with in order to make it easier for them. I have never managed to build a relationship with my mum and this therefore made it even more difficult for my brothers to build a relationship. If Kidstime was available to me when I was younger, I believe things would have been different and I wished that was the case.… I don’t want to see children suffer the same things in life that I have had to deal with”.


February 2015
One of our determined young people, Kirsty Tahta-Wraith, is taking on a personal challenge in March and asks for sponsorship to raise funds for The Kidstime Foundation.
Kirsty will be doing the Salomon Citytrail™ Richmond 10K run in March!

“Growing up as a young carer for my father with bi-polar disorder had its fair share of difficulties. Nearing the end of the journey of childhood, I am so aware of the necessary help the Kidstime workshop group gave me and my family and thus where we would have been without it. There are so many other children like me, but drastically less people aware of their role and willing to help them. The money I raise for The Kidstime Foundation WILL change this!
Though I’m not strictly a kid anymore, the support I received and continue to receive from the Kidstime foundation has stayed with me. It remains credited for many of my past, present and future achievements. Please donate, and enable other children to flourish too.
I will be running a 10 kilometre race on the 22nd of March 2015. All of your donations will go towards the Kidstime Foundation. This is my effort to support those who supported me. Please show your support and donate what you can!”
You can sponsor Kirsty here.
To hear more from Kirsty and her feelings about the work we do and the support children need when dealing with parental mental illness please see her article in the Mail on Sunday and a video piece she did for The Guardian.
January 2015
Happy New Year from everyone here at The Kidstime Foundation! We’re really looking forward 2015 – a very exciting time for us! Our Who Cares? pilot will be launching in the Spring and two of our young people will be launching their fundraising events shortly. Not to mention the on going work of all of our Kidstime Workshops (both existing and new!). Watch this space as we update you with all the goings on.
The Guardian Charity Appeal Blog wrote more about us on New Years day.

We thought we would start 2015 by hearing from some of the people directly helped by your donations. These young people are supported by the Kidstime Foundation, one of the charities chosen for this year’s appeal.
Read the post and watch the videos from our young people here.
December 2014
The Mail on Sunday has published an article on the Kidstime Foundation.
On December 14th Sarah Stacey of the Mail on Sunday wrote about The Kidstime Foundation. The article focuses on the plight of the young carers affected by parental mental health and tells the story of Kirsty Tahta-Wraith and Ambeya Begum, two former attendees of Kidstime Workshops who now work with the Foundation on various projects and frequently attend Kidstime Workshops as young helper.

Kidstime also allows Ambeya to drop her own defences: ‘I try to put on a front that I am always happy. Kidstime gives me a way of releasing my stress. It allows my emotions to flow. I am not angry with my mother but there are times I think it is too late for me to build a relationship: the only thing that I can do is to give her her medicine. That’s the most I can do. She has lost her qualities of being a mum. ’
Ambeya is clear that Kidstime should be available in every school. ‘It’s one of the only charities that teach children what mental illness is and how they can cope with it.
‘I always thought I was the only one but when I go to Kidstime every month, I see so many children. I would like to see all the kids in this situation learn that you can look after your own emotions as well as coping with mental illness as a family.’

Ambeya is now a trustee of the Kidstime Foundation.

Kirsty and her sister were referred to Kidstime 12 years ago. ‘Going to the sessions helped me to understand what to expect and how to deal with my dad’s episodes. It made them much less scary and took away most of the worry and panic.’
One problem Kirsty found was that ‘you can’t talk about it at school because you know it makes you different. But at Kidstime, children talk about mental health all the time so you can stop holding in your feelings. It’s comforting, and I felt more accepting of my dad.’

You can read the article here.
Our article is published as part of the Guardian and Observer Christmas Appeal.
On December 13th the Guardian journalist Bim Adewunmi wrote an article highlighting the work of The Kidstime Foundation featuring a number of young people who have attended and still attend Kidstime Workshops and have been part of the Who Cares? Project.
Angel, 16, whose mum has schizophrenia, has been coming to workshops for two years. She doodles and shuffles a deck of cards while the others speak. “In primary school, I was alone. I didn’t want to talk to anyone,” she says. “My mum was the only thing.”
Kidstime was a chance to meet other kids who had similar – and not so similar – home situations. “I liked meeting people who had different experiences – some worse, some better – and learning how they deal with it.” For her, the casual “mentoring” works in both directions. “If they’re younger, you can give them advice, and if they’re older you can get advice.” Everyone nods. “It’s not therapy – we’re all normal here, we don’t think we’re weird ‘cos ‘our mums are crazy’ – it’s support.” That support is something everyone in the room feels passionately about.
You can read the article here.
At the end of the session, the young people talk excitedly and loudly. But the chatter is filled with ideas on how to make Kidstime even bigger and far-reaching. There’s much to be done, and they’re eager to get started.
November 2014
The Kidstime Foundation has been selected as part of the Guardian and Observer Christmas Appeal.
On November 28th The Guardian and Observer launched their Christmas Charity Appeal. This year’s appeal theme is one of our most common and under-acknowledged health issues: mental illness.
“Our Christmas appeal will raise money for nine superb UK-based charities. Each offers innovative services in their particular areas of expertise, but all have a common mission, which is one we as a media organisation share: to challenge stigma and create more positive societal attitudes towards mental illness.”
Alan Rusbridge – Editor of The Guardian
We’re delighted to get the support and promotion this appeal will bring but also to be part of the discussion around mental health issues and those that need the support we can offer.
“Austerity and cuts have not been kind to mental health services, or the people who rely on them. Our appeal is a recognition of the importance of this vital area of health and social services, and a tribute to the innovative contribution of the voluntary sector.
Last year Guardian and Observer readers helped raise more than £340,000 for charities … Over the next few weeks our journalists will demonstrate – through words, film, pictures and data, online on our Christmas appeal blog, and via our two papers – the brilliant work of our appeal charities.”

October 2014
Young Carers Call to Action: No Suits event at London Zoo.
On Thursday 30th October around 25 young carers and young adult carers hosted a Call to Action “No Suits” event at London Zoo. Health professionals and decision-makers joined the young people to meet them, hear their stories, and discuss what health services can do to better support young carers and their families.
YCiF Champion Charlie spoke to Dr Alan Cooklin, watch the video below:

September 2014
Filming of Who Cares? Masterclass.
Young people from Kidstime workshops gathered to meet a Children’s Mental Health Worker, an Adult Mental Health Worker and an Approved Social Worker to quiz them on many frequently asked questions our young people have about mental health and being affected by a parent’s mental illness. The finished film will become part of the Who Cares? Project and be shown on the Kidstime Foundation website.
July 2014
Article in the Western Morning News.
The Western Morning News visited the filming of the Who Cares? Project at Stoke Damerel Community College to see the impact on the pupils involved. More than 30 of the College’s Year 10 GCSE Drama students took park in four days of filming at the college and on location. Students also contributed to the final script through improvisation sessions with the director and writer.
For one pupil the project changed his life. Joel Archibald’s story emerged during a workshop with the teenagers. He finally found the ability to break his self-imposed silence. He said he believed the film would help other young people. “It’s nice to see someone in your situation and watch what they do. When I saw the first Kidstime ‘Who Cares?’ film I thought that was me. That’s what I am hoping [our] film will achieve.”
All the young people who took part in the project found the project very insightful to the world of those caring for parents with mental illness. Drama teacher Catrina Garratt said “I was very proud of these young people and the care they took for each other.” She said classmates often do not realise that a young carer needs their help and support.

Here we are sharing some of our fundraisers amazing achievements in raising money for us.

Previous Fundraisers:
Ambeya’s Superhero Skydive
 

What perfect timing it was to skydive for Kidstime – the day before World Mental Health Day 2016. Like my China Trek, words cannot fully express what it felt like to complete a skydive. It was simply incredible. From physically shaking whilst signing the declaration before the jump, to landing with the biggest smile on my face, it just goes to show how much and how quickly emotions can change. I can still remember anxiously watching the timer and seeing our altitude climbing knowing; that we were only 5000ft up and still had another 5000ft to go before jumping. If I have to be honest, the worst part (before I said that I loved it!) was when the door of the plane opened. The guy attached to me was on the edge of the plane – whilst I am already dangling in the air! Skydiving made me realise what it is like to put your full trust in someone with your life. But, I don’t want to put anyone off by saying all this.
After jumping out and freefalling for a good 30-40 seconds, it indeed feel like I was diving into the clouds. Feeling the clouds and water particles hit your face feels so refreshing; however grey the clouds look from down below. At least the sun was out when the parachute opened. And that’s when it actually hit me that I’m a few minutes away from completing a skydive. Being up there makes you forget about everything and everyone for a moment. It’s a moment truly to yourself. You have no cares in the world in that moment – all I could actually think about is how long it took for this day to come and how quickly it’s all going to end. The world looks so much nicer from above the ground we walk on. I’m a wimp when it comes go heights. But up there, height wasn’t even an issue. In my opinion, being on a rollercoaster is scarier.
I had the patience to wait over year and a half for an hour of what I could call the best hour of my life. It’s given me back the confidence I had lost and I could not have done it without everyone’s encouragement and support. Kidstime will always stay dear to me. Children affected by parental mental illness are still sometimes left in the dark and its through these crazy events that I organise that I can help raise awareness of the young people Kidstime help. Completing a skydive has always been something important to me; but to know that I have done it for a good cause makes the whole feeling 100x better. I hope one day, these young people are given the life and opportunities which they have wished to have for all these years. I hope me completing this skydive has helped raise further awareness of how we support children with parents with a mental illness. I hope one day, that like myself, everyone can turn around and say ‘Yes, I said I would and could do it, and now I’ve done it.’ Never let anyone stop you from living your life or doing something you’ve dreamed of doing. Because it’s that mentality and negative attitude that makes the work even harder for charities like Kidstime to deal with. Only joking. Kidstime will always be there to support you.
Now it’s time to plan my next adventure!

Ambeya’s Great Wall of China Walk

Ambeya Begum, a former attendee of Kidstime workshops, completed a life-changing trek along the Great Wall of China to raise funds for the Kidstime Foundation in September 2015. We’re very proud of her commitment and determination and wish her well on her continued adventures. Thank you!
“I never imagined I’d have the opportunity to trek the Great Wall of China but to do it in order to raise money for the Kidstime Foundation was simply incredible. No words or pictures would be able to describe my experience there, but what I can say is that it will probably be one of the most rewarding and exciting things I have done in my life so far. Being able to experience a whole new country, culture and environment with a bunch of strangers I met at the airport for departure has turned my life around. I met some of the most amazing, inspiring people who I hope to organise more trekking adventures with. Being able to speak about the Kidstime Foundation and give a talk about the work we do for children looking after parents with a mental illness at the top of Great Wall gave me a spark of hope for the charity. I wish I could go back and do it all over again! I would like to thank everyone who supported me with my fundraising; especially Odeon Marble Arch for allowing me to hold fundraising events which made a huge success. This will not be the end of my adventures, it’s only just the beginning. I will carry on raising money for the Kidstime Foundation and make sure young carers have a better future ahead of them.”        
Ambeya
 

 
Kirsty’s 10k Run
One of our determined young people, Kirsty Tahta-Wraith, also took on a personal challenge in March, participating in the Salomon Citytrail™ Richmond 10K run  raising funds for The Kidstime Foundation. Thank you Kirsty!
“Growing up as a young carer for my father with bi-polar disorder had its fair share of difficulties. Nearing the end of the journey of childhood, I am so aware of the necessary help the Kidstime workshop group gave me and my family and thus where we would have been without it. There are so many other children like me, but drastically less people aware of their role and willing to help them. The money I raise for The Kidstime Foundation WILL change this!
Though I’m not strictly a kid anymore, the support I received and continue to receive from the Kidstime Foundation has stayed with me. It remains credited for many of my past, present and future achievements. Please donate, and enable other children to flourish too.
I will be running a 10 kilometre race on the 22nd of March 2015. All of your donations will go towards the Kidstime Foundation. This is my effort to support those who supported me. Please show your support and donate what you can!”
Kirsty’s sponsorship page is here.
To hear more from Kirsty and her feelings about the work we do and the support children need when dealing with parental mental illness please see the article for The Guardian and Observer Christmas appeal she featured in, and her article in the Mail on Sunday, plus a video piece she did for The Guardian.

The ‘WHO CARES?’ Project
This is a trailer for a new programme we are launching in early 2015.
 It is designed to be used by young people and teachers in schools on our online learning platform. 
The programme includes dramatised scenes and documentary interviews, which illustrate the experiences of young carers of parents with mental illness: the impact that being a carer has on their school lives and how they can be supported by teachers and their fellow pupils.

When a Parent Has a Mental Illness
Produced in association with The Royal College of Psychiatrists, this short film is aimed at children and young people who are the carers of parents with a mental illness. It is introduced and narrated by Chineye, a young carer herself. The film features young people talking about their experiences as carers. It also explains in a very simple and visual way how the brain works and what happens when things go wrong.

Kidstime Workshops
Kidstime workshops are for children, young people and their parents who are affected by mental health issues in their family. It’s a safe place where children can have fun, learn and get help and support from people who understand what’s going on in their lives. The workshops use drama so that young people can explore things they are worried about and begin to develop new ways of coping with difficult situations at home, in school, or in their daily lives.


About the Workshops
The Workshops are monthly run, multi-family groups lasting 2.5 hours. The whole family are encouraged to attend where possible; the parent or parents with mental illness, the non-ill parents, and the children. The groups include explanations of the mental illness for the children as well as drama sessions to represent their experiences. These sessions have been shown in a recent evaluation to significantly diminish the children’s levels of distress and disturbance and to improve the caring approaches adopted by the parents.
Find your local Kidstime Workshop
There are currently Kidstime Workshops running in several areas around the UK, with more being planned to start in different locations around the country. There are also workshops running in Barcelona, Spain and new workshops about to start up in Germany. If you would like to join a Kidstime workshop, or have a family you would like to refer to one in your area, please see the individual links below to understand each workshop’s referral process.

KIDSTIME BRENT


Kidstime in Brent educates children to understand that mental illness, just like a physical illness, can affect anybody. It is nobody’s fault. With role playing, games and exercises, confidence and self-worth improves.
Teenagers can get involved in structuring the programme, assisting the drama worker in putting together scripts and co-producing for all to enjoy acting out scenes.
Kidstime in Brent gives adults the opportunity to learn about mental health from professionals, led by clinical psychologist Dr. Jo Early. Parents and guardians share experience in the mutually supportive discussion group. They often make new friends among peers and, feeling better about themselves, are motivated to better address their issues and make best use of the help and support available in the local community.
Location: HARMONY CHILDREN’S CENTRE; 38 Bridge Road, Church End, London NW10 9BX
When it meets: Workshops are held the third Tuesday of the month during term time. Transport is arranged for families to arrive at 5pm for healthy drinks and snacks. Later pizzas are served. The workshop ends at 7.30pm.
Kidstime in Brent. Safe, welcoming and stigma free!

KIDSTIME CAMDEN & ISLINGTON

WHAT OUR KIDS SAY ABOUT US
‘Home was sad, Kidstime was fun. That’s what I looked forward to. I looked forward to having fun, you know being a child. But at home you have to be an adult, look after yourself, look after mum, look after the house, give her medication; at Kidstime you’ve having fun. You’re being looked after and you’re not looking after others. …there are people there who are paying attention to you and you can go and speak to because you probably can’t speak to your mum because you know she’s not well she probably won’t understand. But Kidstime was time for the kids; I think that’s why it’s called Kidstime. ‘ (Ex-attendee – young person)
‘When I started the Kidstime project, I felt like I couldn’t really express myself, because I know that people often thought that because my mum had mental illness I may have mental illness, so I didn’t want to say anything, because I didn’t want to seem odd or say anything inappropriate, so I kept to myself. So when I started coming to this project, you realise that, not necessarily, because when you know that other people have the same problem as you, and they look normal, they seem normal, that’s its okay to come out and just, you know, express yourself a bit more. So I just felt like I wouldn’t necessarily, after learning about the illness I felt like I wouldn’t necessarily become mentally ill, so it’s okay for me to express myself. ‘ (Ex-attendee- young person)
“I’ve learned a few more names of illnesses and I’ve learned some side effects of illnesses and how to know the difference between if a parent is, stroppy to know the difference if it’s ill stroppy or normal stroppy.” (Young Attendee)
“What I liked about KTW was? “Everyone was listening to each other” (Young Attendee)
“Fun positive atmosphere lots of families come together as one big one” (Young Attendee)
“It changes my whole expression”,”Talking about things and knowing my problems weren’t going to be forever”, “I enjoyed all of it” (Young Attendee)
WHAT OUR PARENTS  SAY ABOUT US
“The supported children who I’ve met through ‘Kidstime Workshop’ have not questioned their parents love and concern and have been fiercely protective of them…but being part of a project focusing on my children’s needs I know has actually made me feel better” (mother who had suffered repeated bipolar episodes)
“This is probably the only outlet for them to be what the project is named after, kids” (Grandparent)
“That we all feel equal with them, we all feel, you know, you just all feel, well, not, obviously we’re coming from different places, but we all feel respected I think, and easy to talk to them.” (Parent Attendee)
“They just behave like normal, they don’t seem to use many tactics because I used to go to therapy and I still go, there’s always some sort of tactic that they try to work around, these people are more like, I don’t know, have a very nice approach, very relaxed approach and I like to be relaxed because I’m not often relaxed.” (Parent Attendee)

A recent example of a group discussion with parents and children:
‘I then asked them to represent how those relationships and feelings changed when a parent was mentally unwell: suggestions were made that the relationship became more fraught, or that anxiety and worry prevented each member of the family to show good feelings towards each other, or possibly create confrontation. We talked about how the feelings of love could be buried by these problems, even though the love still was there. We also talked how it could be possible to rediscover these positive feelings when they get temporarily lost or obscured’.
KIDSTIME HACKNEY


WHAT OUR KIDS SAY ABOUT US
‘I like the drama and the pizza best.’ (Peter, aged 8)
‘Kidstime is fun.’
When talking about different types of illnesses, a 12 year old said: ‘We talked about illnesses that could be cured and illnesses that could not be cured, including mental illnesses. I said that mental illnesses were ‘stronger’ because they affected the whole body’.
‘I wish I had come to Kidstime when I was a kid, and when my mother was unwell.’ (Mother of a 10 year old child)
‘I wish the Kidstime workshop was every fortnight because this really helps me too.‘ (Mother of 9 year old)
‘It’s OK to talk about what happens when I am not well. I used to think it would harm the children if we spoke about it.’ (Mother of two daughters, aged 14 and 7)

86-92 Rectory Road

KIDSTIME WIRRAL

WHAT OUR GROUP SAYS ABOUT US
Kidstime Wirral is a monthly workshop for local families where there is a parental mental health difficulty; with an emphasis on helping children and young people affected by the issue to access information and support.
‘Kidstime is different; it gives everyone a chance to share their thoughts, helping us overcome any fears or concerns we have, helping to increase our knowledge and understanding. It helps everyone feel a little lighter.’
WHAT OUR KIDS SAY ABOUT US
 ‘Kidstime takes action on helping us learn about mental health in really fun ways. We use a lot of drama to help us figure out our own thoughts and feelings about our parent’s difficulty. This makes it easier for us to express things in a way that is interesting and easy to understand. Kidstime is never boring!’
‘We normally start our group activity with lots of fun games and warm-up exercises. We then make up stories together that describe all our different experiences. We act these out and film some of them so that we can show our parents how we feel about the topic we have been working on.’

Dr Alan Cooklin
Dr Alan Cooklin is a family Psychiatrist, working with the Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust. With a team of professionals he pioneered the Kidstime workshop model as a way to help the children of parents with mental illness to understand their parent’s illness, to feel less responsible for the illness, and less fearful of ‘catching’ it. With others in the team he has produced a training film and pack for professionals – ‘Being Seen and Heard’, as well as an online film for children and young people – ‘When a Parent Has a Mental Illness.’ With Dr Leonard Fagin -who runs the Hackney Kidstime workshop with Deni Francis – and together with the Anna Freud Centre, he is setting up a major national research study to examine the effects of the workshops on both the children and their families. He has also been instrumental in developing the ‘Who Cares?’ project.
“I have always been aware that a thin line separates strange family behaviour (of my early family) from mental illness. Then as I trained I realised that the contemporary model of psychiatry isolated the ill individual both psychologically and socially, and took little or no account of the mutual influence of family and other close relationships. After 35 years trying to make good this deficiency, I realised that the most vulnerable members of the family – the children – were still left out. Kidstime, ‘Who cares ?’ and the work of the Foundation are spear-heading a response to meet the needs of these neglected children and their families”

Dr Leonard Fagin
Dr Leonard Fagin is a Consultant Psychiatrist and Honorary Senior Lecturer at University College London. He runs a Kidstime Workshop in the London Borough of Hackney, as well as offering parental mental health supervision in Hackney Children and Young Peoples Services. He also works with the Anna Freud Centre in the Family Assessment Service providing multidisciplinary reports for Family Courts. He is a Second Opinion Appointed Doctor for the Care Quality Commission and a Lord Chancellor’s Visitor for the Office of the Public Guardian. He has authored books and papers on a variety of subjects including the effects of unemployment, of burnout in mental health professionals, on how to improve therapeutic environments in in-patient settings and care of people with personality disorders.
“As a consultant psychiatrist working for many years in deprived areas of East London I was able to see the transgenerational impact of mental health in families. Helping children to develop resilience when having to cope and  respond to parental mental illness offers an opportunity to break this cycle for future generations. The Kidstime Foundation has as its aims the creation and dissemination of interventions that can aid in this process, and as a trustee I welcome the opportunity of making a contribution in this much needed arena.”


Chineye Njoku
Chineye Njoku has been a young carer of a parent with mental illness for most of her life. She was originally a young person’s member of the Kidstime workshops, and is now (and has pioneered the role) an ‘experience counsellor’, using her own past experiences to help other young people with a parent with mental illness. She has recently started a new TeenTalk Kidstime group, with Deni Francis, for older young people who have a parent with mental illness. She has completed a biomedical science degree, MSc in Mental health: Psychological therapies, post graduate in low intensity cognitive behaviour therapy and intends to continue with post-graduate studies. She currently works in the field of mental health. Chineye has managed to combine her work and family life with acting as both a pioneer advocate for the needs of these children and young people as well as giving professional presentations to different groups in the UK and Norway.
 

Dr Guinevere Tufnell
Dr Guinevere Tufnell: After training as a doctor and then a psychiatrist, Guinevere worked in a wide variety of mental health services before becoming a child and family psychiatrist. After practicing as consultant psychiatrist in a busy East London clinic for many years she left to become consultant psychiatrist with the child and family unit of The Traumatic Stress Clinic in Central London. The TSC moved to Great Ormond Street Hospital in 2005, where Guinevere specialised in assessing and treating children and families who had been psychologically traumatised as a result of experiencing violence, abuse and bereavement. Her work included consultation, training, teaching, and medico- legal work. She has a longstanding interest in improving the general understanding of mental health issues, and has collaborated on numerous “public education” leaflets and media information projects for the Royal College of Psychiatrists. She instigated and was commissioning editor for Mental Health & Growing Up – a series of factsheets – available on the Royal College’s website – for parents, teachers and young people. She has also published articles on a variety of topics relating to child mental health. She also worked for many years on the telephone advice line for parents run by the child mental health charity YoungMinds, for which she was also a Trustee.
“I wish Kidstime groups had existed when I was working with children and families in East London. They would have been so valuable because Kidstime provides a unique opportunity for children and young people to boost their understanding and shrink their fears about mental illness.  It’s a safe space where they can share information with each other and with family members – and feel stronger and more confident about how to get help if they need it.”
 

Tina Cowen
Tina Cowen has been a city solicitor for 30 years and is currently a consultant with New Media Law a firm providing legal services to the music, television, film and publishing industries. However she has also found time for more social enterprises. Until recently she was chairman of Oracle Care a specialist residential care service for young people with complex needs requiring support, education and therapeutic interventions. Oracle Care was set up 6 years ago with the intention of being a market leader and provides a dynamic outcomes based service, focused on the rights and wellbeing of the young people in its care whilst simultaneously creating safer communities. Tina is committed to making a difference for children and young people with difficulties in their lives.
“Having worked with children in residential care and seen the impact that a parent’s mental health can have on a child I welcomed the opportunity to  get involved with the Kidstime Foundation and its work in identifying those children and helping improving their outcomes.”
 

Ambeya Begum 
Ambeya Begum is currently studying Banking and Finance at University and has been volunteering for over a year as The Kidstime Foundation’s young helper. Her ongoing support has also been recognised in her role in the NHS as an NHS Changemaker. Part of her responsibilities consist of being a voice on behalf of young people; have young carers recognised and helping the NHS manage their social return on investment. As a young carer herself of a parent with mental illness, Ambeya’s passion in helping others is reflected through her contribution to the charity. She provides ongoing support to young people in the monthly workshops and has proactive involvement in the Who Cares Project; giving recommendations from her own personal experiences. Ambeya feels that she needs to give something back to the community and has volunteered to take part in a sponsored Great Wall of China Walk in September 2015, which she hopes will help raise money for our current projects.
“Working for the Kidstime Foundation is always an amazing, yet overwhelming experience for me. Having never had a Kidstime Workshop experience whilst growing up, I take it as an obligation on my behalf to prevent others experiencing a tough childhood. Seeing a smile on a child’s face when they leave a Kidstime Workshop is one the most rewarding experiences.”
 
Claire Johnston

Claire Johnston has been a Director of Nursing, operating on NHS Mental Health and Community Trust boards for 15 years, with responsibility for nursing and allied health professionals as well as quality improvement programmes, clinical risk, human resources and organisational development.  She has also worked in clinical and operational service roles in family and mental health and safeguarding, and then took up a role as the Royal College of Nursing’s National Advise in Primary Care.  She also worked as a policy adviser in the Chief Nursing Officer’s team on nursing in primary care and school health.  Claire is currently on secondment to Capital Nurse, which is a London wide programme to get nursing right – meaning the right number of nurses, with the right skills in the right place – working to deliver person-centred nursing to users wherever it is needed.  Claire is an honorary clinical professor of nursing at Middlesex University’s Institute of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work.  She edited a book on new models of mental health practice in 2012.  In 2015/16 she was a Florence Nightingale scholar and carried out a study on the benefits of ‘under the surface’ coaching for student nurses and new qualifiers, to support them with the complex emotions they face on a daily basis in their work with patients and their families.

“Directly working with families where a parent suffers with mental ill health, as well as managing front line teams in health and care, I have seen first hand the devastating impact on children’s lives.  Children of a parent with mental illness are astonishingly creative and courageous –  taking on young carer roles with their mum or dad which would defeat many an adult.  But this is often at great expense as their chances to do well at school, to build friendships and to grow into well balanced adults are diminished.”

 


Natasha Sloman

Natasha is a senior manager with experience of managing integrated services, leading across both health and social care. A social worker by background Natasha has worked in mental health services for nearly twenty years, primarily running homeless and assertive outreach services. She now works at the Care Quality Commission as a head of hospital inspection and she has significant experience of health and social care regulation.  Natasha is driven by wanting to make a difference and has a passionate belief in social justice and equality. She is also Fellow at the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence.
“I love being involved with the Kidstime Foundation, the people are inspiring and passionate and everything is about helping children and young people to make sense of their world and support them to develop strategies which help them manage. These young people are truly inspiring and if there is anything we can do make life a little easier then let’s do it. Its time the world woke up to these kids and their potential.”



Kiran Sheena Premnath

Kiran brings experience of balancing budgets in difficult conditions and will help Kidstime to find new solutions without compromising quality.
“By investing in tomorrow’s generation, the Kidstime Foundation ensures these children are not alone to face this uphill battle. Consequently, they would grow to become leaders who place empathy and patience at the heart of their leadership. In a world corrupt by ambition and competition, this truly is a much needed and inspiring initiative.”

Alastair:
“As someone who has known mental illness, and now campaigns for better services and understanding for the mentally ill, I welcome and support The ‘Who Cares? Project.
Mental ill health does not only affect the patient but their family, friends and wider circle, and for children and young people it can be particularly hard to have a parent who is mentally ill.
The project offers a chance to understand and talk about a parent’s illness, and to be in a school which is more understanding of what children are having to manage at home. It is a great relief that this project can help children both learn about and make sense of their parent’s illness, and as a result hopefully increase their resilience and make them less vulnerable to future mental ill health.”
Ade:
“When I was a child my mum had a nervous breakdown, it was scary and confusing to see someone who was normally so strong looking and feeling so vulnerable. Its never easy to talk to your parents about these things, especially when you don’t even know whats happening to them. Kidstime helps to breakdown these barriers by teaching kids about mental illness, and its treatments. It also gives families the confidence, and communication skills, to talk openly in a safe space about mental health issues.
I wish Kidstime was around when I was younger but I’m glad they’re here now to make life a little easier, and the future a little brighter, for families dealing with mental illness.”

2) To inform and train education and healthcare professionals to identify and support children affected by parental mental illness
3) To lobby for proper recognition of children affected by parental mental illness and their needs
4) To work with external groups such as peers and parents to build understanding of the needs of children affected by parental mental illness
The Objectives of the Foundation are:
1. To support and develop methods to help children and young people who have parents with mental illness.
2. To educate professional staff of different disciplines, as well as the general public, about the needs of the children of parents with mental illness.
3. To develop educational tools and interventions to raise awareness of the needs of the children of parents with mental illness, and to counteract stigma.

The ‘WHO CARES?’ Project
The unique in-school project helping children of parents with a mental illness

This project is aimed to create a model of explanation and understanding of mental illness, to reduce stigma, to define and create the support needed by the children whose parents suffer mental illness. 


” Through the Who Cares? Project in school, I now recognise myself as a young carer, and that there are others like me.  My peers in class now understand what my life is like, and why I am sometimes worried…

I used to think that I was nobody, but it’s like Who Cares? has given me a voice and that sharing my experience can help others.  Me and my dad have a future.  The world is no longer such as dark and frightening place. I feel that the Who Cares? Project has saved my life.”
Joel, 15 


Find out more about The ‘Who Cares?’ Project – Visit  this page  
Download the leaflet giving an overview of the ‘Who Cares’ project here.
See the ‘Who Cares?’ project launch event here 





‘The Who Cares? Drama team wrote a play for assemblies in school. The audience were so engaged and the focus so intense you could hear a pin drop. They really took in the message. By the end of the week over 600 people watched this student-led work.
One young carer said: “I really enjoyed it. The Who Cares? Project has given me so much confidence and even made me want to carry on with directing and performing”.
Catrina Garratt – Head of Drama at Stoke Damerel Community College

When a Parent Has a Mental Illness
Produced in association with The Royal College of Psychiatrists, this short film is aimed at children and young people who are the carers of parents with a mental illness. It is introduced and narrated by Chineye, a young carer herself. The film features young people talking about their experiences as carers. It also explains in a very simple and visual way how the brain works and what happens when things go wrong.

Kidstime Workshops
Kidstime workshops are for children, young people and their parents who are affected by mental illnesses in their family. It’s a safe place where children can have fun, learn and get help and support from people who understand what’s going on in their lives. The workshops use drama so that young people can explore things they are worried about and begin to develop new ways of coping with difficult situations at home, in school, or in their daily lives.


About the Workshops
The Workshops are monthly run, multi-family groups lasting 2.5 hours. The whole family are encouraged to attend where possible; the parent or parents with mental illness, the non-ill parents, and the children. The groups include explanations of the mental illness for the children as well as drama sessions to represent their experiences. These sessions have been shown in a recent evaluation to significantly diminish the children’s levels of distress and disturbance and to improve the caring approaches adopted by the parents.
Find your local Kidstime Workshop
There are currently Kidstime Workshops running in several areas in the UK, with more being planned to start in different locations around the country. There are also workshops running in Barcelona, Spain and new workshops about to start up in Germany. If you would like to join a Kidstime workshop, or have a family you would like to refer to one in your area, please see the individual links below to understand each workshop’s referral process.

Being Seen & Heard
Children with a parent with mental illness often fall through the professional net and are seen as nobody’s responsibility. Nothing is explained to them, and they often receive no help at all to deal with the effects of the parent’s illness.
 
 

 
All professionals working with adults with mental illness need to stop and think about the needs of these young people. This training package provides practical and creative suggestions about working with children and parents. It contains clips of children, young people and their parents talking about their experiences of mental illness and how professionals can work effectively with them.
This training video has been developed for the exclusive use of staff involved in the care of mentally ill parents and their children – whether from the Health, Social Care, Education, Probation or Voluntary Sector Services.
A CD-ROM of additional resources is enclosed with the video:
Training pack

Video training pack with CD-ROM 2004. £36 (incl. VAT)

Background to the
‘Who Cares?’ Project
Two million young people between 5 and 18 in England have a parent suffering from a mental illness. However there is evidence that when a child can be helped to develop an understandable working model of mental illness, that this can improve their own resilience. This, combined with positive school experiences and challenging of any bullying they otherwise experience, can improve school participation, attendance and attainment.
Ref: Parrott L., Jacobs G., and Roberts D. (2008)

The ‘Who Cares?’ Project provides a fully comprehensive kit of materials and a support system for teachers and students which primary and secondary schools can use to address the needs of young people affected by parental mental illness, as well as the attitudes of others towards them.
 
The Who Cares? Materials:



Using a mixture of drama sequences – highlighting some of the difficulties faced by young carers – video interviews with young carers and advice from professionals, together with written materials, exercises and activities, our programmes promote discussion about the experiences of living with mental illness.



              
Stills from Who Cares? drama sequences
The packages:

The first package helps teachers and school staff develop skills in identifying children whose parents have a mental illness; helps them understand the nature of mental illness and its impact on children of ill parents, so that that they are better equipped to meet their needs; provides information about other resources, support and specialist help; provides training & information about communicating with children about their parent’s illness and offering understandable explanations; provide training about how to engage the families of affected pupils and provides training & support in the use of the second and third packages.

The second package is aimed at improving understanding of mental illness, the emotions and fears it arouses and deterring the bullying or targeting of affected young people. It contains curriculum materials for teachers which provide information about how common mental illness is; provide some dramatic representations of ways in which ‘others’ may relate to the families experiencing mental illness; address the fears of young people becoming like an `ill’ person or of `catching the illness’; illustrations of the similarities between parental mental illness and other adversities such as family violence, alcohol and drug misuse, which they may themselves have experienced; provide suggestions for positive ways to respond to children of parents with mental illness and to others who ‘target’ those children.

The third package is for those children who have a relation suffering from mental illness and help them understand that they are not alone and and that they can share their experiences with others in similar situations. It provides a ‘survival tool kit’ to help them manage situations both at home and at school; includes tips on how to deal with the many professional agencies that they often find so confusing; offers clear explanations of the emotional and neuro-scientific aspects of mental illness, as well as other descriptions and explanations of mental illness – how it develops, what treatments are used, and what conditions affect outcomes; provide ideas about protecting themselves from some of the effects of the parent’s illness, and how to develop their own resilience; giving information about how to access other resources, support and advice.

The Kidstime Approach
The Kidstime Foundation provides explanation-based interventions to children significantly affected by parental mental illness to increase resilience, reduce the risk of their developing mental ill health and improve life outcomes.

The Kidstime Foundation
In response to the ‘Keeping the Family in Mind’ conference, a group of professionals led by Dr Alan Cooklin began to develop Kidstime Workshops, an explanation-based, whole-family intervention aimed at developing children’s resilience to parental mental illness. The original Kidstime Workshops took place in Camden and Islington in 2000. There are now 7 Kidstime Workshops running in the UK and another 3 due to start. A further 2 are running in Spain, with 3 more due to start. Following this, TeenTalk Workshops have been developed, aimed at older children, and two earlier films aimed at both children and professionals produced.
The Kidstime Foundation was registered in 2012 to formalise this ongoing work. The foundation brings together former affected young people, nurses and psychiatrists, to develop programmes aimed at providing evidence-based, explanation-centred interventions to young people whose parents are experiencing severe mental ill health.
The foundation’s overriding aim is to increase understanding of mental illness amongst the general public, in particular but not exclusively by:
Educating professionals and the general public about the needs of children and young people who have a parent with a mental illness.
Developing educational tools and interventions to raise awareness of children’s needs in order to counteract stigma.
To this end the foundation:
Promotes resilience in the children who are affected by parental mental illness.
 Promotes positive attitudes to mental health for affected young people.
 Works to reduce the stigma associated with mental ill-health in general, and with children of sufferers.
 Works to reduce the burden of emotional overload in vulnerable families.
“[Kidstime was important in learning that] It’s nothing to be ashamed of, to be embarrassed about.”
“There should always be an optimistic viewpoint on it, that’s what Kidstime has taught me.”
Uzma, Kidstime Workshop attendee

Children We Help

The Kidstime Foundation works with young people significantly impacted by parental mental illness, their parents, carers, teachers and peers, to build resilience, reduce morbidity and improve life outcomes.

Origins and History
In 1999, at a key national conference called Keeping the Family in Mind, a group of young people made an angry, passionate presentation about what it meant to be a child caring for a parent experiencing mental illness when adult help arrived:
‘the worst thing was when the mental health services got involved … they came in like the SAS to take our parent, no one explained anything, and worse still no one asked our advice or what we knew.’
The Kidstime Groups and later the Foundation were a response to this impassioned plea for change and visibility. 
The scale of the issue
An initial estimate by Aldridge and Becker identified approximately 65,000 young carers of parents with mental illness in England and Wales, with about 1 million children significantly affected. In 2010, the Social Care Institute for Excellence updated this estimate to 2 million children.
The negative impacts of parental mental illness on their children are well documented (Oats, 1997; Nicholson et al, 1999, 2004; Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2011), with 70% of affected young people experiencing one or more of:
Loss of education through poor attendance and emotional distraction.
High levels of anxiety about the parent/s and their own potential of succumbing to the same illness.
Social isolation resulting from stigma, rejection by peers and self-isolation.
Guilt and an excessive sense of personal responsibility.
High levels of subsequent depression.
Fortunately, quite small interventions have been shown to substantially increase a child’s resilience and ability for self-protection. (Quinton and Rutter 1984; Rutter, 1966). Clear information and explanation of the parent’s illness, and of the impact on themselves of the illness and its treatment has been consistently shown to improve resilience (Bostock, 2004; et al.). A study of 11–15 year olds living with a depressed parent, by Garly et al. (1997) found they wanted information and discussion with a knowledgeable but neutral adult to help them understand 4 key aspects of their parent’s illness:
The nature and cause of the illness, including their own feelings of responsibility and vulnerability.
How to recognise the signs of an impending illness.
When a parent should be hospitalised, and what happens when this occurs.
How to manage the illness and its effect on both themselves and their parent.
“It’s the idea that it’s not her [my Mum’s] fault, because it’s not her fault, it’s her illness.”
“Before, I just didn’t want to speak to my mum, or acknowledge her. [Kidstime helped me with] the understanding that she wasn’t in control of it.”
“It was no body’s fault really, it just happened to her [my Mum] and it can happen to 1 in 4 people too.”
Juliet, 11 years old, Kidstime workshop attendee

The Finnish Adoption (Tienari et al., 1994, 2004) study and earlier work by Rutter (Rutter et al Rutter M., 1996, 2004) demonstrated that when relationships in the child’s environment are improved, the child’s future resilience to mental illnesses, even when they carry a genetic vulnerability, is enhanced. But major interventions like adoption are rarely required and in fact quite small interventions can make a significant difference. Even such small interventions as explanation of a parents’ s illness have been shown to significantly improve the child’s mental health.
The Kidstime Foundation has connected with MindEd to link up with resources that can help you with a child who is dealing with their own mental illness. MindEd is somewhere you can find out about common signs of mental health problems affecting children and young people. Important: If you are concerned about someone who is at immediate serious risk you should contact your local support services immediately.

When a Parent has a Mental Illness
Produced in association with The Royal College of Psychiatrists, this short film is aimed at children and young people who are the carers of parents with a mental illness.
It is introduced and narrated by Chineye, a young carer herself. The film features young people talking about their experiences as carers.
It also explains in a very simple and visual way how the brain works and what happens when things go wrong.

The ‘WHO CARES?’ Project
The unique in-school project helping children of parents with a mental illness

This project is aimed to create a model of explanation and understanding of mental illness, to reduce stigma, to define and create the support needed by the children whose parents suffer mental illness. 


” Through the Who Cares? Project in school, I now recognise myself as a young carer, and that there are others like me.  My peers in class now understand what my life is like, and why I am sometimes worried…

I used to think that I was nobody, but it’s like Who Cares? has given me a voice and that sharing my experience can help others.  Me and my dad have a future.  The world is no longer such as dark and frightening place. I feel that the Who Cares? Project has saved my life.”
Joel, 15

‘The Who Cares? Drama team wrote a play for assemblies in school. The audience were so engaged and the focus so intense you could hear a pin drop. They really took in the message. By the end of the week over 600 people watched this student-led work.
One young carer said: “I really enjoyed it. The Who Cares? Project has given me so much confidence and even made me want to carry on with directing and performing”.
Catrina Garratt – Head of Drama at Stoke Damerel Community College
