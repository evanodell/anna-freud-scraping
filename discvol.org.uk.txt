North Yorkshire Horizons’ 1st Year


1st year celebrations for North Yorkshire Horizons




 
Home » North Yorkshire Horizons’ 1st Year





								Thursday 08th October 2015							


Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


North Yorkshire Horizons, the ground breaking alcohol and drugs Recovery Service for the county has been celebrating its first year of delivering innovative recovery work. It has held birthday celebrations at all five of its Community Hubs in October  to celebrate the 313 clients who have been discharged from the service having become alcohol or drug free.
Ted Haughey, Operations Director at NY Horizons, said: “This represents a major breakthrough, not just for those people recovering from alcohol and drug addiction but also for families and friends who can look forward to a brighter future for loved ones who are on their way to permanent and sustained recovery from their addiction – Every single day, across the whole of North Yorkshire, we strive to ensure that everyone who contacts service receives the support needed to beat their addiction.”
In the first year the service has had 2,686 people referred, either by self-referral, from friends and family, or from other professionals including medical practitioners.
From the initial referrals received by the service, 1972 individuals received specialised assessment based on the severity and complexity of their addictions.
The Hubs, based in Harrogate, Northallerton, Scarborough, Selby and Skipton, held celebration events during the first week of October where members of the public were invited to meet the staff and service users, find out about the services we deliver and learn about the successful work undertaken on a daily basis that can and does lead to life changing experiences.
Individual Hubs also held cake bake-offs, graduation ceremonies, tombolas and acupuncture clinics.
If you would like more information on the work being delivered by North Yorkshire Horizons which provides support to people suffering from issues related to alcohol and drug misuse, please call the confidential Freephone number 01723 330730.

DISC has been accredited with the nationally recognised quality mark for organisations which provide support to individuals to make informed choices about their learning, work and life goals – the Matrix Standard.

In 2014/15 we helped over 12,000 people and wanted to ensure that these clients were receiving the best information, advice and guidance possible. Liane Taylor, Assistant Director of Service Employment & Social Enterprise at DISC, said: “It is essential that impartial and high quality information, advice and guidance is embedded within everything we do.
“The Matrix Standard supports us to continually improve our services by benchmarking against best practice and ensuring we measure the impact of the services we provide, which supports us drive up standards. It’s fantastic that the assessment recognises the strong culture within the organisation, and the dedication of our staff who always go the extra mile to meet the needs of our service users”.
DISC gained accreditation to the Matrix Standard in 2006 and receive visits from assessors every three years to review progress. Matrix assessors praised the work carried out by DISC since their last visit, commenting: “There is a genuine desire to provide the highest standards of support to help service users and to provide them with a positive experience.”

DISC expands housing support service in Sefton







 
Home » DISC expands housing support service in Sefton





								Tuesday 07th July 2015							


DISC Housing
DISC News


DISC is proud to announce the start of its new Sefton Homeless project which began work on Wednesday 1st July and has been set up to provide assistance and support for homeless people in the Sefton area.
DISC is part of a wider partnership providing a full range of accommodation and support services for those people unfortunate enough to suffer from homelessness. There has been a 25% rise in the last twelve months of people sleeping on the streets, and Sefton Council regards the new project as a key part of its work.
Councillor Trish Hardy, Sefton’s Cabinet Member for Communities and Housing, is keen to emphasise the importance of the new service “This Council has a long standing commitment to helping people who are suffering from homelessness. We have both a legal and moral duty to help those people who are amongst the most vulnerable members of our society.”
The project will provide a number of innovative opportunities for those people who wish to recover from alcohol and drug misuse. There will be a 10 bed housing accommodation service that includes access to groups and key workers, giving those in most need the very best chance of achieving their abstinence objectives. DISC will also provide a service for those people at risk of becoming homeless or in housing need in the Southport and Formby area, which will focus support with key workers working with the most vulnerable sections of society, a similar but more intensive service runs across the county for offenders who may be at risk of becoming homeless.
Unique to the project is the ‘personalisation’ funding pot which supports individuals to overcome barriers to employability, such as access to privately rented accommodation and support to deliver furniture, bedding and carpets to allow clients to move into habitable homes. By providing support in these areas, we give people the very best chance to continue with their rehabilitation and to live productive lives for the benefit of themselves and their local community.
DISC’s Senior Manager for Independent Living Services said “Our services work. In 2014/2015 we provided housing-related support interventions to 3863 clients, helping them to achieve over 97% of their desired outcomes. We are excited to be able to continue to bring this success to Sefton, working with Sefton Council and local partners to support those in need’’

Calderdale in Recovery creates a buzz

								Monday 13th July 2015							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


A local project is buzzing with excitement after securing a grant to develop a bee keeping project in Southowram.
Calderdale in Recovery, based in Halifax and Todmorden, provides recovery orientated life changing support and inspiration to people who use the new drug and alcohol treatment system. This new bee keeping project aims to inspire even more people to join the recovery community and demonstrate how life can be enjoyed without using drink or drugs. The new treatment system, Recovery Steps is made up of a partnership between DISC, St. Martins Healthcare and The Basement Recovery Project is already delivering successful outcomes to hundreds of people across the area since commencing operations in February.
The recovery community was initially consulted on what kind of project they would like to become involved with, and one of the suggestions that caused a stir was the development of a bee keeping programme.
Following an application to Community Foundation for Calderdale, a sum of £1,571 has been received from the Kathleen Mary Denham Fund that has allowed the purchase of hives, safety equipment and the first colony of bees; in fact, everything that is required to develop a thriving bee keeping community.
The Calderdale recovery community members are swarming over the project and have taken delivery of their first bee hives, alongside a nucleus of 4000 hybrid New Zealand honey bees. The aim of the bee keeping project is to allow people in recovery to develop their husbandry skills and to ultimately produce “Recovery Honey” that will be sold to support local community led initiatives.
Andy Bryant, Recovery Builder and Chair of Calderdale in Recovery is delighted; “This project is innovative and exciting, and allows service users the chance to develop unique skills and to be part of a project where they can witness progress and actually enjoy the fruits of their and the bees labour. We’re proud of how the new treatment system is doing and how Calderdale in Recovery is helping. This helps highlight the willingness of service users and workers to develop new ways of supporting people with addiction.”

Selby’s inspirational Drug & Alcohol Centre praised by High Sheriff







 
Home » Selby’s inspirational Drug & Alcohol Centre praised by High Sheriff





								Thursday 16th July 2015							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


The High Sheriff of North Yorkshire, Charlie Forbes Adam, praised the ‘inspirational’ North Yorkshire Horizons Hub in Selby following a visit on Friday 26th June.
Mr Forbes Adam, whose charity work during his year in office is focusing on drug and alcohol addiction, said he was “humbled and amazed” by the tremendous work carried out by the North Yorkshire Horizons service.
North Yorkshire Horizons delivers specialist drug and alcohol services to people in North Yorkshire, where recovery orientated services are delivered via a range of local Hubs in Selby, Harrogate, Scarborough, Skipton and Northallerton.
“I was so impressed by the inspirational work carried out by the staff and volunteers at North Yorkshire Horizons,” said Mr Forbes Adam, “The atmosphere at the Hub was positive and friendly, which is so important for individuals using substances entering recovery. A number of volunteers were in recovery themselves and their bravery was humbling.”
He went on to add “It may come as a surprise to some that a relatively quiet market town such as Selby needs a drug and alcohol advice Hub. But addiction is no respecter of environment and there are a significant number of people of all ages in the Selby area who need help in their struggles with drug and alcohol. North Yorkshire Horizons, provides that help in spades. It is an oasis for those in the nightmarish grip of addiction and is supporting many addicts on their road to recovery. This outstanding Hub deserves our fullest support.”
During his visit, the High Sheriff met staff and volunteers and presented the newly-trained volunteers with High Sheriff Awards, toured the building, listened to a first-hand account of a service user on the way to recovery and enjoyed an informal lunch.
Lesley Dawber, the Lead Worker at North Yorkshire Horizons Selby Hub, said “The High Sheriff’s certificates that are presented to volunteers for their ‘Contribution to visible recovery in the Community’ are fantastic and it was great to have Mr Forbes Adam at the event to present them.”
North Yorkshire Horizons Selby Hub is based at 74-76 Gowthorpe, Selby, YO8 4ET and the telephone number is 01723 330730

New CEO Announced

								Tuesday 02nd June 2015

DISC News


Chief Executive Mark Weeding announced that he is retiring from his role as CEO and revealed that his successor will be Paul Townsley, currently Northern Director of The Lifeline Project.
During Marks time DISC has seen a significant increase in turnover, rising from £400K in 1990 to £21m in this financial year. “Following the last year of really strong results, I feel that it’s the right time for me to step down and enjoy some quality time away from the pressures of running a successful organisation such as DISC,” said Mark. “We have carried out an extensive recruitment process and following a successful interview, I’m delighted to hand over the reins to Paul, who is highly thought of in the sector and who brings wealth of experience to the role.”
Paul is currently working for The Lifeline Project as Northern Director, before that he was a Senior Director at the Crime Reduction Initiative (North) and prior to that he was the Chief Executive for the Westminster Drug Project for ten years. Paul is looking forward to the challenges he faces when he takes over the role in August. “Working in the sector I have always admired DISC and the Chief Executive role is a fantastic opportunity coming at an exciting time for DISC and myself. Mark and his team have brought DISC to a great place. “
DISC is currently well placed to expand its operations, with a major new project about to start in Leeds on July 1st. Aligned with all the current work being undertaken across the North of England, it looks as though the new CEO will certainly find that he’s joining a progressive organisation that has further plans to expand “There are some great opportunities and challenges ahead and I cannot wait to start on the task of helping DISC and its service users fulfill their potential and build upon DISC’s reputation as an excellent provider of Social care services “ said Paul.
“DISC is well positioned for significant growth, due in large part to Mark’s vision, his leadership skills and his commitment to excellence. He will be greatly missed by DISC’s staff and the Board of Directors,” said Jim Black, Chair of Trustees at DISC. “Mark has the Board’s best wishes and we are indebted to him for his many years of exemplary service to DISC’s mission.”
Mark joined DISC in June 1990 and became CEO in December 2009. A new three year strategy was implemented in 2011 to set the organisation off in a number of new directions, including Locality Development Projects, DISC Housing RSL, More Time and the Northern Inclusion Consortium. All of these projects continue to grow, and with a strong emphasis on Key Outcome Targets, DISC is able to demonstrate the impact of all our projects. “Having just enjoyed celebrating the 30th Anniversary of DISC, it’s good to know we have a dedicated staff, a strong and involved Board of Trustees and a considerable number of volunteers supporting our work, I am immensely proud of the organisation that we have built here that’s goes the extra mile for those most excluded from society” said Mark. “I know that Paul has all the tools, resources and support needed to ensure that DISC continues to help the most vulnerable people realise their potential.”
Mark plans to make a visit to Bolivia, where he will attempt to climb some sections of the Andes he’s previously been unable to visit. “There’s a lot of mountains to be climbed and I’m not getting any younger, so I aim to visit many of the places that I’ve so far been unable to reach.”
All the staff and volunteers at DISC wish Mark the very best for the future, and look forward to working with Paul to continue to deliver the very best service to service users.

Success in Bradford for Housing Services

DISC Housing
DISC News


We have great news to share as we have been successful in the tender for the Bradford ‘No Second Night Out’ service, which is due to start in October 2015 and will be delivered from Discovery House in Bradford.
DISC already provides the Street Outreach element of the provision, however has now been awarded the Accommodation and Move on provision with specific responsibilities in providing additional support during Cold Weather. The service will be delivered in a partnership model with all local providers and Bradford City Council, however, the core delivery is in formal partnership with Hope Housing.
The service is aims to support ‘new’ and entrenched rough sleepers over the age of 18, ensuring that they don’t spend a second night sleeping on the streets, with every ‘No Second Night Out’ client receiving an offer of planned independent housing within a week.
DISC’s Senior Manager for the service said ‘’we are very pleased to continue to contribute to addressing the housing needs of those in Bradford. It is an exciting prospect to expand that provision into such important area. Our services work. In 2014-15, 100% of DISC’s Bradford Street Outreach clients were supported to reduce debt, develop confidence and better manage their health, with 97% of clients exiting the service in a planned and accommodated way’’.
DISC and Hope Housings provision of this service will reduce the demand on local services and help people, in need, move towards independent living freeing up much needed local services.

Five Young Carers from our Young Carer project in Darlington enjoyed a fantastic daytrip to the Lake District during the half-term holidays.
The lucky individuals were selected for the trip were from a group who have taken part in an ongoing gardening and development project on the Tees Valley YMCA site funded by Cleveland Scientific Institute. The young people, all from Darlington Young Carers, act as carers for either siblings or parents and they have been specially chosen from across the charity to enjoy some respite from their daily activities.
Accompanying the group on the trip were Kevin Lloyd and Paul Shelton of the Cleveland Scientific Institute. Originally, the destination for the trip was the banks of Loch Lomond, where a flight on a Seaplane and lunch at the beautiful Cameron Lodge were booked. However, as the minibus travelled through Cumbria, Kevin received a call informing him that due to poor flying conditions in Scotland, the flight had been cancelled!
Instead of admitting defeat and turning back to County Durham, the group detoured to the Lake District and hopped aboard the steam boat at Pooley Bridge, making their way down Ullswater to enjoy lunch in a local restaurant. A return boat trip saw the Young Carers safely back on dry land and contented after an enjoyable and surprising day out.
The five young people really enjoyed the trip, stating “It was relaxing, fun and exciting,” and that they really appreciated “Getting out and about and doing exercise.”
Darlington Young Carers recently worked with the Cleveland Scientific Institute (CSI) on a project for children to grow plants from which they could extract dyes and then dye some fabrics. This project was part of the overarching programme to promote Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) to local children. The science and process engineering understanding involved in the project was significant, and the children were exposed to scientific ideas that may have been missed due to time lost in formal education as a consequence of caring for disabled or sick family members.
The Young Carers work came up in a conversation between the Vice President of the Institute, Paul Shelton, and his friend Kevin Lloyd. Kevin, owner of Netting Services (Northern) Limited, immediately offered to organise an exciting trip to reward the children for their hard work and commitment.  Originally planned to visit Loch Lomond, after the cancellation due to weather, the Kevin’s quick thinking allowed a change in location and activity to ensure the Young Carers had a day to remember.
Kevin said “I’ve been continuously impressed with the tireless work these young people undertake to help loved ones on a day to day basis. When Paul told me about the science project they had been involved with, and the circumstances the children face on a daily basis, it was an easy decision to make to donate this gift, providing something a little bit different for these selfless individuals and allow them to enjoy something spectacular and memorable.”
Kevin’s generous gift off the flights had been supplemented by his offer to drive a minibus all the way from Darlington to Loch Lomond and return, in tandem with Paul Shelton. Both had to reschedule a number of business appointments, happy in the knowledge that the gift was a once in a lifetime opportunity for these young people.
Support from other businesses has been tremendous, with Transflex Vehicle Rental’s MD Peter Abdale offering the free use of a minibus, all recognise the importance of the often unseen work that these young people undertake, and these acts of generosity really do help make the lives of young carers that little bit better.
Cheryl Hunter, Senior Practitioner on the Darlington Young Carers Project, has been amazed by the local support. She said “We were overwhelmed by the extremely kind offer from Kevin Lloyd and would also like to extend our thanks to the other parties involved in making this day come together. The children involved in the work funded by Cleveland Scientific Institute with YMCA and Sally Reckert have not only had the opportunity to have a break from substantial caring roles but have learned new skills and are really enjoying seeing how the project and garden at YMCA is developing each time they come. The children had a wonderful experience in the Lake District and it will be something that they will remember for a very long time. We’re looking forward to working with the YMCA project over the summer months.”
Paul Shelton also noted “We’re very grateful for the contribution that Kevin has made to support our work and in promoting STEM activities. The STEM businesses in the Tees Valley will no doubt benefit from generous donors, such as Kevin, to the Institutions work in promoting uptake in Science and Engineering amongst young people and we would welcome further monetary or kind donations from business.”

Students’ Fundraising for Macmillan a piece of cake

								Tuesday 29th September 2015

Fundraising


Our students made fundraising a piece of cake when they got together and organised their own event for Macmillan Cancer Support World’s Biggest Coffee Morning.
The 16 to 18 year olds on the Steps 4 Success education and training project based at DISC near the Blue Bridge in Newton Aycliffe, encouraged friends and family to join them in baking and selling cakes and pies as part of the annual fundraising event. They collected a total of £189.25.
Caitlin Lowe, 17, from Shildon brought in a corned beef pie baked by her mum.
Caitlin said: “It’s my mam’s specialty and my favourite, so when I asked her to make one for today she was delighted to, especially since my granddad passed away from cancer seven years ago and he had a lot of support from Macmillan nurses.”
Isaac Farmer, 16, from Coundon, also contributed a corned beef pie baked by his grandma, said: “I asked my Nan to make a corned beef pie but I didn’t realise that there’d be competition!”
Andrea Dixon, Project Manager for Education and Training Services at DISC, said she was delighted by the response of the young people who are on the Steps 4 Success course to learn skills to help them into work, training and further education.
She said: “We’re delighted that this event has raised so much money and that it’s all going to such a great cause. The students organised it and have really worked well to make this a success. It means a great deal to them to know they are helping other people.”
DISC chief exec Paul Townsley and chair of trustees of our charity, Jim Black were once again there with the young learners, having a chat and this time a bit of cake, too.

MP visit to DISC







 
Home » MP visit to DISC





								Friday 06th November 2015							


DISC News


Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson visited DISC today to see how lottery funds have allowed us to deliver innovative projects across the North of England that improve the lives of hundreds of people.
Mr Wilson met Angie Hutchinson, Director of Children and Young People’s Services at DISC during a visit to the charity’s headquarters today.
Mr Wilson said: “I’m delighted to be visiting DISC, a beacon of excellence that helps to inspire individuals, their families and communities to overcome incredibly difficult circumstances to achieve improvements in their lives”.
DISC currently receives funding from the BIG Lottery for the WY-Fi Project (West Yorkshire Finding Independence) that helps improve the lives and wellbeing of people with entrenched multiple and complex needs who are suffering from homelessness, addiction, re-offending behavior or mental illness.
Lottery cash also helps DISC’s BRICWorks project in Hull, which provides skills development, education, training and volunteering and employment opportunities to individuals and communities.
Angie Hutchinson said: “As the MP for our headquarters’ constituency, we’re delighted to meet with Phil to discuss some of our projects.
“It’s appropriate that the visit is during our Diversity Month, and one of our flagship projects is the North East Gender Identity service that is based in Newton Aycliffe and works across the north east. It was recently awarded Investing in Children accreditation and is just one of a number of really important, life changing projects that we’re involved with, not just within Phil’s own constituency but across the North of England”.
Other local DISC projects that will be discussed with the MP include the Darlington Young Carers Service that supports young people and their families to reduce the impact of caring for a family member or friend, and the Skills4Success study programme that provides enhanced learning opportunities which was rated as ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted.
Angie added: “The support of the BIG Lottery has been instrumental in the success of both WY-Fi and BRICWorks, and we’re able to learn from project successes there to help develop other successful projects in the parts of the country where we work”.

CATERPILLAR, PETERLEE HOSTS LOCAL TRAINEES

Bosses at the Caterpillar articulated trucks plant at Peterlee were delighted to play host to a group of young people who attend DISC Steps 4 Success  training course which is aimed at helping them get jobs.
The young people were shown the shop floor operations at the plant which employs around 1,200 people.
Jonathan Clappison, HR Consultant at the plant, said: “Caterpillar promote work in the community and are keen to develop local talent.
“One of Caterpillar’s core values is sustainability and young people from the local area are key to caterpillar’s future success.
He said apprentices at Caterpillar were “the cornerstone of the business” and the company was always looking to recruit local talent to build a sustainable talent pipeline for the future, with an on-site Apprentice Manager providing information about Caterpillar’s advanced apprenticeship scheme.
Mr Clappison added: “Caterpillar are always keen to provide opportunities for young people in the local community and visits such as this will provide the students with an opportunity to understand how a global manufacturer operates. “
Lewis Musonda, a project worker for DISC, which aims to improve opportunities for different sectors of the community, said:
“The young people on the Steps 4 Success course really enjoyed their visit and were able to see for themselves what working for a highly successful international company would be like.
“It was fantastic to see these amazing trucks at different stages of completion and then coming off the production line!”Mr Musonda added: “We are very grateful to Caterpillar for hosting this visit. We continue to receive tremendous support from employers all over the North East.”

North East Equality Awards







 
Home » North East Equality Awards





								Thursday 29th October 2015							


DISC News
Employment, Training and Education
Health, Children, Young People & Families


DISC and More Time were proud to be shortlisted finalists at the North East Equality Awards.


DISC North East Gender Identity Service were finalists in the”Groups that have made a difference”  category

MoreTime were finalists  in the “Organisations under 50 staff” category

Founded in 2011, More Time Ltd is a not for profit Social Enterprise company providing cleaning, building and renovation services alongside furniture recycling and a catering operation. It creates ways into employment for those who can struggle to access mainstream employment, such as those from the Gypsy and Roma community and ex-offenders, as well as offering volunteer opportunities where individuals can update their work history with real work experience.

Liane Taylor, Assistant Director of Service Employment & Social Enterprise at DISC, was delighted that More Time has been nominated: “It is hugely motivating to be able to create volunteering and employment opportunities to those who have been previously excluded from the labour market due to barriers they may have faced.
“The work that More Time does has allowed us to develop a loyal and committed workforce who are passionate about what they do, and we feel this is reflected in the service we provide. Our mission statement is “Business where society profits”, and we’ve certainly seen that come true in the last twelve months”.
In partnership with DISC Housing, More Time has recently worked on an Empty Homes project across Hull, Hartlepool and County Durham that offered 40 volunteer placements and created 11 full time jobs for the unemployed.

DISC’s Gender Identity Support Service has been working for the LGBT community for 6 years, delivering the only specialised support service for young people (aged 15-25) across the North East. Providing support for ‘coming out’, legal and employment rights, access to medical treatment and awareness raising, the service, funded through Comic Relief, is making a massive difference to the lives of its members.
Billijean Summerbell, DISC Team Leader for The Gender Identity Support Service was delighted to have been nominated for this award “The young people who we help, face many barriers to living a happy life.
One 17 year old service user from Newcastle, who did not wish to be identified, said: “I honestly don’t know what I would have done without their support, they really have helped me.”
The service also works with local organisations such as schools, colleges, social care providers and health providers to provide training professionals to provide awareness raising activities to help them effectively meet the needs of young people experiencing gender discomfort.
Debbie Hickling Walker, project leader at project partner Trinity Youth Association said “We’ve supported 146 young Transgender individuals across the North East of England, empowering them to thrive in the face of adversity, helping them overcome issues around transphobia, mental health and poor educational attainment”.

DISC News


DISC are now providing a new service in partnership with Bradford Council, the ‘No Second Night Out’ service. The service is designed to give immediate help to single people who have become homeless. It will provide support to The service will aim rough sleepers within Bradford as soon as they become homeless to prevent them becoming hardened to life on the streets.
The service is ran from existing hostel on Barkerend Road, on the edge of the city centre.
Dave Targett, DISC Senior manager, said: “We are very pleased to contribute to addressing the housing needs of those in the greatest need.”
“By providing this service we will help to reduce the demands being made on other local services by helping people move towards independent living.”
Councillor Val Slater, Bradford Council’s deputy leader, said: “We need to intervene as soon as possible when a person becomes homeless to stop them from becoming hardened to living on the streets. “The ‘No Second Night Out’ service will offer people somewhere to sleep when they first become homeless, with an emphasis on addressing their problems and helping them into settled accommodation.”
“The new service will deliver emergency accommodation to meet the Council’s commitment to provide shelter to rough sleepers during the winter months, when the temperature drops below zero,” said Councillor Slater.
Using a dedicated outreach team, the service will provide support to help get people off the streets immediately, and offer them short term emergency housing while a solution to their needs is found.
Cllr Slater said: “The council had learnt from other schemes and developed the new service to meet the needs of the district.
The decision to award DISC the contract was due to the extensive experience DISC has of working with homeless people in the district.”

Cleveland Police commissioner attends Transgender Day of Remembrance event







 
Home » Cleveland Police commissioner attends Transgender Day of Remembrance event





								Monday 23rd November 2015							


Health, Children, Young People & Families


A successful partnership  project, based in Middlesbrough, celebrated the Transgender Day of Remembrance #tdor on Friday 20th November, with the planting of a heart shaped floral tribute made up of purple tulip bulbs.
The event was attended by Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner, Barry Coppinger.
North charity DISC’s LGBT project teamed up with MyPlace and DISC’s Platform Young People Substance misuse service P to raise awareness of the issues faced by young people aged 15 – 25yrs old who are transgender or transitioning and currently access services in and around the Middlebrough area.
Mark Blyth, Senior Practitioner at DISC’s LGBT Service in Middlesbrough is looking forward to seeing the tulips next Spring.
He said “The blossoming flowers will be a sign of hope. The work Platform  and the  LGBT team are doing with transgender service users and their families is providing hope to people who continue to be discriminated against in their everyday lives”.
Commissioner Coppinger, said: “We know that many members of the trans community experience discrimination on a regular basis. Events such as this send a message out to the whole community that young transgender people will be supported and discrimination will not be tolerated.
“We’re proud of our diverse culture in Cleveland and the police will continue to deal sensitively and robustly with any issues raised”.
Supported by the commissioner, B&Q, Teesside University and Teesside Positive Action Ltd, the event is just one of hundreds happening across the world with the aim of bringing the plight of transgender people and their families to the attention of their local community and to celebrate the diverse nature of the communities in which we live.
The local celebrations form part of a month-long Diversity Awareness campaign delivered by DISC to highlight all forms of diversity in the communities where it works, including a visit to a Hindu Temple, an over 50’s Roadshow, Children in Need sponsorship events and a sporting challenge at Durham County Cricket Club.
Mr Blyth explained the transgender community was represented by the colour purple, and it was decided to use purple tulips to represent lives lost through violence against someone who is transgender. The growing tulips would also represent life continuing to flourish in spite of hardship. They were planted by Platform Middlesbrough service users in the MySpace Middlesbrough garden on North Street and should appear next Spring.
The service offers one-to-one support, peer support groups, training and awareness raising. To make a referral or for more information, please call to speak to a member of the team on 01325 731 160.

Award winning Newcastle solicitor helps transgender young people for free







 
Home » Award winning Newcastle solicitor helps transgender young people for free





								Friday 18th December 2015							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


Transgender young people who are fighting to establish their identities have thanked an award winning Newcastle lawyer who is working for free for them.
The young people all attend the gender identity services run by Northern communities charity, DISC in partnership with Trinity Youth Association. So far, Cris McCurley, a partner at the Newcastle firm, Ben Hoare Bell has enabled 15 people to change their names by deed poll.
Billijean Summerbell, a DISC team leader for LGBT services, said: “Cris is so kind to do what she does for the young people who are in transition.
“Changing your name is such a big step. It gives people who are trans so much self-confidence. If they open a bank account or have to present ID in any situation, it can be excruciating if your name does not match your gender identity.”
And she continued: “With their names changed, our service users can really begin to blossom in life and not feel they’re one step away from a course word or nasty look or some other, even violent, humiliation.”
Cauley Jefferson, a DISC servicer user from Middlesbrough, who is transgender, said a name change was very important to him. After completing his own at Ben Hoare Bell solicitors’ in Byker, Newcastle, he said: “It feels really good. It is difficult, especially meeting new people, trying to be identified as male and then having to give a female name. It’s a bit of a confidence knock.”
Ms Summerbell said: “Cris is a really warm person who treats everyone with genuine respect. Young people are just skipping when they know she’s sorted out all the legal stuff to make it happen. They hug her. It’s a magical, life changing moment for them.”
Ms McCurley, who last year was named ‘Solicitor of the Year’ at the national Law Society Excellence Awards, said: “I am happy to be in a position to help these young transgender people. Changing their given name is crucial. But it’s also daunting and can be complex and costly.”

Local people in Northallerton who attend a charity’s drug and alcohol recovery programmes are raising money this Christmas by making Yuletide wreaths for sale.
The service users at North Yorkshire Horizons’ Northallerton recovery hub in the Applegarth, have also made table decorations, baubles and other Christmas tree decorations.
Craig Bosomworth, of North Yorkshire Horizons, which is managed in partnership by Northern communities charity DISC, said: “Our service users have really enjoyed this. It has been a very positive experience for them.
“Some did not think they were any good at arts and crafts but the fact they have made a fantastic Christmas wreath or table decoration they can show their family, means a lot for their self-esteem as they recover.”
Karen Bushell, of North Yorkshire County Council Adult Education, conducted the courses and guided the work.
She said: “I think everyone’s got a great deal out of making the decorations. Many didn’t think they could do it but now they’re really proud of what they’ve achieved.
“It wasn’t easy for some at first but they were determined to give something back. I think everyone is benefiting.”
Paul Townsley, Chief Executive Officer of DISC bought five wreaths for friends and family. He said: “The wreaths are really well made and they look fantastic. We’ve had some great compliments which we are passing on. We are so grateful to these service users for their selfless work to help others.”
The wreaths and other decorations will be sold on behalf of the social enterprise More Time UK which is owned by Northern communities’ charity DISC which works with partners to manage North Yorkshire Horizons.

Hull traders serve up Christmas dinner for 75 homeless people







 
Home » Hull traders serve up Christmas dinner for 75 homeless people





								Tuesday 22nd December 2015							


DISC Events
DISC Housing


Around 75 homeless people in Hull have accepted an invitation to a full Christmas dinner, courtesy of the BRiCworks community hub and kind hearted local traders.
Amy Peacock, at BRiCworks, on Story Street, said: “A lot of the people who come to us through the year are lonely and isolated and find this time of year particularly hard. It can also be very cold as all know.”
“We are an alcohol-free venue and people recovering from alcohol and drug addiction come here for company and to spend a little time with friends who understand.
“We felt we couldn’t abandon them and had the idea of putting on something special for Christmas. We’re proud and honoured to be able to host their dinner.”
The venue, which is managed by Northern communities charity, DISC and funded by the Big Lottery, will hold three sittings on Christmas Eve to accommodate the diners.
Amy asked local traders if they would help provide the food for a turkey dinner with all the trimmings and was not disappointed with the response.
She added: “There really is something special about the community spirit in Hull. We didn’t have to ask twice. We’ve had so much support from traders all over the city and in the villages aroundabouts, too.
Craig Thompson who sleeps rough in the city and comes into the BRiCworks building up to five times a day for hot drinks, low cost meals from the five star hygiene rated kitchen and for company, said: “I think what BRiCworks is doing and what the traders are doing is fantastic.
“It means a lot to us in the homeless community that people care.”
The diners will enjoy a three course meal with a vegetarian alternative to turkey available. The Christmas cake which will be served will not have alcohol in it. It will be washed down with non-alcoholic “mocktails” and hot drinks.

Charity finds mum and toddler a home just in time for Christmas

DISC News


Charity workers who run a project to get local people in need into rented accommodation have handed over the keys to their latest resident – just in time for Christmas.
Charlotte Hope has just moved into a new home in the centre of Spennymoor after being referred to a scheme run by DISC Housing, a Registered Social Landlord which renovates empty properties in a deal with landlords and then leases them to people in need.
Charlotte who has a two year old daughter (name withheld in line with DISC’s safeguarding policy) had been unable to find a home herself.
Charlotte said: “DISC helped me a lot. They’ve helped me get my own house, helped me get my money sorted out. It means everything. “
Her new home is one of the DISC properties renovated through The Empty Homes Initiative, with the renovation process of the property costing £12,500 to complete.
It is the latest of 14 empty properties in County Durham renovated by DISC and More Time, its social enterprise subsidiary. The homes have provided a high standard of safe and secure accommodation to people across the county.
Claire McCreanor, Assistant Director at DISC Housing, said: “We’re so happy we were able to get everything done in time for Christmas for Charlotte and her daughter, however our work goes on all year round.
“We are very proud of what we’re able to do for local people who might otherwise not be able to find a home.”
Charlotte has also received help and support in setting up payment plans for her utilities from DISC’s Independent Living Programme, which helps young people in County Durham between the ages of 16-25 develop their independent living skills.

Work Experience Provides Spark for Success

								Tuesday 05th January 2016							


DISC News
Employment, Training and Education


A teenager from Newton Aycliffe is the latest of nearly 90 young people to gain a “first class” work placement through our County Durham education programme which aims to help people reach their full potential.
Kryran Harris, 16, who is a trainee on the Steps 4 Success course is enjoying life on a ten week work experience placement at County Durham Housing Group. He is trying his hand at a variety of trades including electrical work, plumbing and plastering.
DISC Education Services was cited last year as providing “Outstanding education, care and skills” by Ofsted, which included Kryran’s Steps 4 Success course.
The 45 week course aims to remove barriers to employment for young people and increase their self-esteem and motivation. In the last three years, 87 course trainees have been helped into work placements.
Rebecca Drummond, Employment Engagement Advisor at DISC, said: “I’m delighted for Kryran.  When he joined the programme, he was unsure of what he wanted to do. We’ve worked with him to understand his strengths and interests and have secured a first class placement where he can have a taste of experiences in the construction trades with the aim of helping him to identify a career path.
“We are very careful where we place our students and do a lot of research to ensure they are supported throughout their working days.”
Steven Brown, of County Durham Housing Group, said he was pleased by Kryran’s dedication.
Mr Brown said:  “We’re always looking for committed young people to come and work for our company, and we’re happy to help local individuals understand just exactly what being a tradesperson involves.
“Kryran is willing to get stuck in and that’s just the kind of enthusiasm we look forward to in an apprentice. Each member that Kryran has worked with has commented on his commitment and work ethic. We will be seeking another work placement from DISC in the future.”
Kryran said he was particularly interested in being an electrician. He said: “Once my training programme is completed at DISC I’m looking to secure employment in the construction industry, so this experience has been really helpful to me”.

Partnerships: our unique approach
by CEO Paul Townsley







 
Home » Partnerships: our unique approach





								Monday 25th January 2016							


CEO Blog


Partnership means collaboration, not competition.
I have had the privilege of being Chief Executive of DISC since July 2015 and it’s great to have my first blog on the new DISC website. When I applied for the role of Chief Executive last year and wrote down what comes into your mind when you think of DISC, it is partnerships.
For me, DISC is and always has been synonymous with partnerships. I believe DISC’s approach to partnership working is a unique approach in the health and social care field.
DISC believes that only through partnership working can we best meet the needs of the communities we serve. Partnership means collaboration not competition. One of the key reasons I applied for the role of CEO of DISC is that I also recognise that the only way we are going to work effectively around the range of needs our clients and communities have is through a collaborative, not a competitive, approach.
In a lot of the areas of our work, such as substance misuse and housing, there is not much genuine appetite in commissioned services for providers that come with a partnership model. The net result is that this form of commissioning leads to communities and service users losing out. Knowhow and expertise are lost as well as the wasted resources expended within a single provider model.
I don’t like large scale monopoly models of delivery because they bring bureaucracy and often squeeze out service users, communities and smaller providers. DISC’s partnership models have a lot to offer and we want to replicate this across the full range of our social care models.
Pioneering
Over the years,  we have worked with local authorities, the NHS and large, privately-led supply chains. We have also pioneered with third sector colleagues to form the Northern Inclusion Consortium and we’ve led partnership and consortia models.
At DISC, we operate as a medium sized provider effectively connecting communities and smaller effective providers with much larger providers and commissioners. We feel this innovative way of working has never been more needed. For DISC it means we need to remain fleet of foot, whilst at the same time having the processes in place to assure high quality services.
Our WY-FI project
The WY-FI project, for example, is funded through Big Lottery and is one of the most ambitious of their Fulfilling Lives national projects. WY-FI is trying to bring about system change across the five boroughs of West Yorkshire for people with complex needs including substance use, homelessness, re-offending behaviour and mental ill health.
We have developed a partnership with Barca, Spectrum, Bridge Project, Foundation and Community Links as providers in the five areas and Shelter, Touchstone and Together Women Project providing specialist support in advocacy, BME, Prisoner Engagement and Women’s services.
One of the key differences from other programmes is the central role Experts by Experience and service users play in establishing and changing the delivery model and the ability to have dialogue with a range of stakeholders to try and make systemic changes to commissioning and delivery in West Yorkshire.
Since working with WY-FI, I have been struck by a rare space for providers, commissioners and service users to reflect and review services so that we can improve services in communities. As many people comment, partnerships can be difficult and resource-heavy. With this large partnership we have had to strive in the first two years to make sure competitors/partners including ourselves work together; other providers not formally involved get engaged; and; to engage with commissioners so that they benefit from the funding and learning.
Intensive packages of support
We love this way of working because of the need to co-design social care services that need to change, work much more efficiently and effectively and create better outcomes for communities. In WY-FI, we have already started to see the benefits of more intensive packages of support and tailored services meaning we save local areas tens of thousands of pounds with each individual we work with. A one size fits all approach just does not work for our clients and their families and communities.
For DISC, we want to explore partnerships along a continuum from merger and consortia working on one axis and small innovative community initiatives to large scale corporate partnerships on the other axis. It fits within our purpose of helping everyone realise their potential and promoting social inclusion across the North of England.
Paul Townsley,
 CEO of DISC

DISC supports Young Carers Awareness Day







 
Home » DISC supports Young Carers Awareness Day





								Thursday 28th January 2016							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


DISC is supporting today’s National Young Carers’ Awareness Day. (January 28th)
Emma Crawford-Moore, Project Leader of our Darlington Young Carers service, said: “Awareness days like this are an excellent way of ensuring that more young people and their families understand that help and support is available.”
She said: “We currently provide support to 113 Young Carers in Darlington in a scheme funded by Darlington Borough Council. These carers are young and provide so much invaluable support within their families.
“Our service delivers respite to those young people. It may be through a trip to a bowling alley or a museum or activities such as crafts or gardening. We offer One to One Support, support groups, information, advice and guidance and whole Family Support.”
“We work with Young Carers as young as five years old. They may perform physical care for relatives, or provide much needed emotional support. The Young Carers who engage with our service are responsible for looking after adults or siblings, with issues ranging from long term illness, a learning/physical/mental disability, drug or alcohol issues, dementia or terminal illness.”
Our service seeks to ensure that Young Carers can develop improved family relationships, higher aspirations, fulfillment of personal, educational and employment potential and a reduction of the isolation that can be caused by being a Young Carer.
Key workers ensure all support needs are addressed and provide advice and guidance  around issues Young Carers face during the transition to adulthood, such as housing, careers, education and health, as well as delivering an out of hours helpline and peer mentoring to build confidence, skills and support networks.
A parent information day is being held between 11am and 2pm on February 24th at the Dolphin Centre in Darlington, which will offer information and advice for any parents who are interested in learning more about the Young Carers service.
DISC recently celebrated being awarded support from BIG Lottery Funding to provide a service for Young Adult Carers across County Durham.
For more information on our services please contact 01325 483038, email dyc@disc-vol.org.uk, or visit https://www.disc-vol.org.uk/services/darlington-young-carers

Slimming menu that is out of this world

								Thursday 28th January 2016

A Newton Aycliffe café is helping customers tighten their belts this January by providing a selection of slimming meals that are out of this world.
Café MoreTime, has developed a range of healthy eating options as part of the charities commitment to the Better Health at Work Awards, where it has already achieved silver status.
The introduction of the café’s new menu is part of a wider drive by DISC to help foster health and wellbeing at home and in the workplace. The great thing about the café offer is that it’s open to everyone, so the general public, as well as DISC employees can benefit.
Mel Evans pictured with a selection of the healthy option menu
The MoreTime café at DISC’s offices next to the Blue Bridge in Newton Aycliffe, has developed a menu of healthy foods that not only taste great but are also low in calories –  something that many of us are looking for after the over indulgence of the Christmas period.
Delicious option such as Chicken and Potato Curry, Beery Barley Beef Stew, as well as salads with fat free cottage cheese and fat free dressing are all available and are fantastic value and virtually sin free for those on a controlled diet.
Mel Evans, café manager at MoreTime, is absolutely delighted by the early success of the low-calorie offers. She said: “Most people come back to work after the New Year looking for ways to cut down on calories. We wanted to provide everyone with the opportunity to eat healthily for less, that’s why we’ve developed a special menu for January that concentrates on healthy and wholesome food that is compatible with a slimming lifestyle. However, the food tastes that good, you don’t need to be on a diet to enjoy it!”
As well as providing eat-in services, the MoreTime café, also provides take-out options and will be happy to deliver outside catering. It’s open between 9am-3pm Monday to Friday.
MoreTime is owned by DISC and as a not for profit organisation places an emphasis on the creating employment pathways for DISC service users, as well as offering volunteering opportunities for people to develop skills and improve their work experience. Alongside the catering operation, MoreTime provide an affordable furniture scheme, repairs and maintenance work and contract cleaning.
The menu options can be enjoyed by everyone, and has been developed for use with Slimming World’s Eating Plan.
For more information, please call 01325 731350.

Members of a County Durham project for people with learning disabilities have been playing cricket in the winter time courtesy of Durham County Cricket Club.
Members of the Pelton-based GOALs project enjoyed a memorable day at the Emirates Durham International Cricket Ground at Chester-le-Street as part of a tabletop cricket event organised by the club.
The GOALs service users had been brushing up their cover drives, pulls and square cuts with miniature cricket bats for several weeks with advice and support from Ron Young, the Disability Cricket Consultant for Durham County Cricket Club.
Ron said: “It was really satisfying to work with everyone at GOALs. The enthusiasm and dedication of the service users, the volunteers and the staff was heartening. – it was great to see so many members take part.
“The enthusiasm shown by the GOALs team was infectious, we’re delighted they enjoyed the day and we look forward to seeing them knocking more boundaries in the future!”
Ann Knapton, Manager at GOALs, was delighted at the events success “Our service promotes social integration through access to events such as the cricket, and we’ve been delighted with the enthusiasm of the staff here at Durham Cricket Club have shown towards our group.
“It’s been a great day and we look forward to coming back again”.
GOALs is a modern community based Day service which supports adults with learning disabilities, allowing them to live a healthy and fulfilling life, by ensuring individuals have a person centred plan which is reviewed on a regular basis.

								Thursday 24th December 2015							


DISC News


More Time Furniture Volunteers’ Christmas effort
Volunteers at a social enterprise based in Newton Aycliffe have been working flat out just like Santa to deliver goods in time for Christmas.
The team that who work for the Moretime Furniture store next door to the Newton News offices on Hilton Road, Newton Aycliffe are responding to a seasonal rush for second hand sofas, dining tables and beds as families on the town prepare for the big day.
Liane Taylor, Assistant Director of Service Employment & Social Enterprise at Northern charity DISC which owns More Time said: “Christmas is a very busy time for us. People are buying new furniture from shops and they’re thinking of us by passing on other furniture to More Time.
“It means we can sell these pieces of furniture on at low prices to local families. We’d like to thank everyone who is donating furniture and buying it.
And Liane added: “We just couldn’t do what we do without the help of the team who volunteer on the van. They know that as we’re a social enterprise, all the proceeds of our sales are ploughed back into the local community.”
The More Time store sells, bedroom, dining room and living room furniture as well as electrical goods including TVs, cookers, fridges and freezers.

Learning Disabilities Group Picks Litter for Village







 
Home » Learning Disabilities Group Picks Litter for Village





								Wednesday 17th February 2016							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


Community spirited members of a group for people with learning disabilities in Pelton have been tidying up their local area by doing a litter pick as part of their regular walk.
Members of the GOALs (Go Out And Live) group, which is run by Northern communities charity DISC at the Pelton Community Centre are familiar faces in the village near Chester le Street.
But they have now begun sprucing up the neighbourhood by doing litter picks as they go on their way.
The service users, some of whom have severe mobility problems, are led by Nina Cara-Collins, of Living Streets, the UK charity which promotes the benefits of walking.
Anne Knapton, GOALs project leader, said: “Our GOALs service users really enjoy their regular walks but they had noticed there was a bit of litter about and they felt they wanted to be good neighbours by picking it up. They were very pleased to help.”
Living Streets Durham project coordinator Nina Cara-Collins said: “I have been working with the service users in GOALs since August last year and we have been exploring routes near where they meet as a means to improve their health.
“We carried out an audit of the roads we use to identify problems that create obstacles for people with mobility difficulties such as a lack of drop-kerbs and street furniture. An issue that we kept seeing was litter, so the group decided to do something about it.
“Walking regularly has been shown to have marked effects on people’s well-being. It’s sociable and can be enjoyed by people of all generations and abilities.”
They also put up posters issuing an open invitation to the wider community to join them in collecting and bagging up the rubbish they found.

Students Produce Sculpture for Cathedral







 
Home » Students Produce Sculpture for Cathedral





								Monday 22nd February 2016							


DISC News
Employment, Training and Education


Students in Newton Aycliffe are carving out a lasting reminder of their work on an award winning course by creating a sculpture for Durham Cathedral.
The youngsters on the Steps 4 Success training course which is run by North ern charity DISC, are working with local artist David Gross.
The oak panel art piece will be on public display as part of a rolling exhibition programme in the cathedral’s upcoming £10m Open Treasure exhibition – which opens later this year – and will be included in the cathedral’s permanent collection of treasures.
DISC project worker Lewis Musonda, said: “We’re delighted we’re able to work with David to give the students this experience and we’re very grateful to Durham Cathedral.
“The students are designing and carving eight oak panels which will form a sculpture they are creating with David. It’s great that the young people know they’re producing a work of art which will be seen by so many.”
DISC partnered with Durham Cathedral’s Recreating the Community project which invited the students firstly to visit the landmark and gain inspiration from designs inside it.
Philippa Coad, the cathedral’s Learning and Outreach officer, said:  “The Recreating the Community project is commissioning work to be done around the county, as part of our Open Treasure Project
”We’re really pleased to be working with the Steps 4 Success students at DISC. The sculpture is going to be amazing.”
The woodworking was undertaken at DISC headquarters in Horndale Avenue, Newton Aycliffe after comprehensive health and safety instruction.
Artist David said: “The young people have been really enthusiastic. I think the Students were surprised by how quickly they could see good results, and this encouraged them to do more. And they know they’re creating something that will be around for ever.”

It’s the way that we do things that gets results
by CEO Paul Townsley







 
Home » It’s the way that we do things that gets results





								Thursday 03rd March 2016							


CEO Blog


“T’aint what you do (it’s the way that you do it)…that’s what get results.”
For me, the Fun Boy Three and Bananarama song originally sung in 1939 sums up the importance of espoused and lived values in an organisation. At this time there is a need for positive values being central to our work because to put it bluntly there is so much negativity around us.
Many commentators whether they are looking at global issues and businesses or the situation in the UK social care and health arena agree we are in an ‘age of upheaval’. We are starting to see this in the services we deliver and service users, families and communities we work with.
Having positive values is critical
No one really knows what health and social care is going to look like in five years. Having positive values is critical to making sure we remain coherent at a time when DISC’s and other services practical help is needed as much as ever.
We share the following with our partners and comparator organisations in two ways:

A lot of our key people staff, volunteers and service users have no particular attachment to DISC. Indeed many have not actively selected to come to DISC to work for or use our services but come to us because we deliver a particular contract or service in a particular area


Our field is increasingly homogenous with values looking really similar and most of us aspiring to deliver the same quality of service with the same core ingredients.

On this basis, the difference between the best quality organisations and the poorer ones becomes how you unify as an organisation behind shared values and a mission and purpose and, crucially, how you deliver on this and test these lived values in your service provision. For example, lots of people and organisations say they go the ‘extra mile’ and innovate but how do we create ways of doing this and measure whether it is happening. 
At DISC, we are embarking on an organisation-wide consultation with all staff, volunteers and service users to review and capture the mission, vision and purpose of DISC. This process is about testing our assumptions on our values, as well as unifying our work across our multi-thematic service offer with key behaviours that people recognise in DISC. If we get this work right I believe that whatever happens in the next 5-10 years we will thrive because we will be delivering much needed services well.
Getting it right
In my view, values are incredibly important in an organisation. They shape all interactions and interventions and make each organisation uniquely different. In times of constant change and ups and downs they hold organisations and our work together. In conversations in meetings with managers, staff and volunteers across DISC we did get to the point where how we lived the positive values we have are probably more important than what they are.
Apologies for the reference to a 1982 hit for those not born when it was released and of course we may have people reading this who remember the original version in 1939. It does stand the test of time and tain’t what you do it’s the way that you do it is central to DISC’s plans in the next few years.
by Paul Townsley, Chief Executive Officer of DISC

Hartlepool Halloweeners need party help







 
Home » Hartlepool Halloweeners need party help





								Tuesday 27th October 2015							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families



Our Voice 4 You group for adults with learning disabilities, is looking for donations of raffle prizes and Halloween decorations to help make their Halloween party a success.
Linsey Carr, Coordinator of the Voice 4 You, is excited by the Halloween Party idea: “By holding a party we hope to not only help current members enjoy themselves and raise money for the development of the group, but we’re looking to attract new members as well to help shape the service moving forward.”
“If any local organisations, businesses or individuals would like to help in anyway, no matter how big or small, the group would be grateful for support.”
The group has already received welcome support from Hartlepool Borough Council who have provided vouchers for the raffle, and Greggs the Bakers have kindly donated food and drink for the party. There’s always more needed though, so please get in touch if you would like to help.
Voice 4 You meets at the Centre for Independent Living on Havelock Street in Hartlepool, once a fortnight on alternative Thursdays between 3pm – 4.30pm. The meeting allow members to express their thoughts and feelings on how they are treated by local and regional organisations with whom they have contact, as well as allowing them to share and learn from their positive and negative experiences.
The group perform checks on local hospitals and drop-in centres, to make sure the information and access provided is suitable for those with learning disabilities, and provide feedback to help facilities improve the way they work.
 
By holding a Halloween party, Voice 4 You hope to encourage more adults with learning difficulties to visit the service and help shape services in the future.
The party takes place on Thursday 29th October 2015 at the Hartlepool Centre of Independent Living on Havelock Street, tickets cost £1 per person and the group is especially keen to welcome visitors or friends and family of those over 18’s who experience learning difficulties.
For more information on how to help, or for more information on the Voice 4 You group, please contact Linsey Carr on 01429 851361.

Calderdale Recovery Steps Celebrates First Birthday

								Thursday 25th February 2016							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


An innovative drug and alcohol service which has helped over 1200 people across Calderdale has celebrated its first birthday with the opening of a revamped health and wellbeing centre in Todmorden.
The Calderdale Recovery Steps’ Todwell Centre on Burnley Road in the town has been developed to provide a full range of support people with drug and alcohol problems, delivering motivational workshops, drop-in sessions, acupuncture and breakfast clubs.
To celebrate, the Town Mayor of Todmorden, Councillor Steph Booth cut a special birthday cake at the Todwell Centre on Burnley Road to mark the first anniversary of the service.
The service is run by North charity DISC in partnership with St Martin’s Health Care CIC and the Basement Recovery Project.
Paul Townsley, Chief Executive Officer of DISC, who attended the event said: “Calderdale Recovery Steps has engaged with over 1200 service users across Calderdale in the first year of the service, and over 170 at the Todwell Centre, which is fantastic.
“We’re committed to providing first class support to the people of Calderdale – we welcome anyone with concerns about drug or alcohol misuse and ask them to get in touch.
“The presentations by current and past service users ensured that everyone who was there to mark this milestone understood just how important this type of work is to the health and wellbeing of those people in the community who need it most.”
The Todwell Centre is one of three Calderdale Recovery Steps centres across the borough, providing services for people with issues around drug and alcohol addiction.
Samantha Jones, Area Manager at Calderdale Recovery Steps, said: “It was a celebration of all the hard work service users and staff have undertaken to make the service a success.
“We’re delighted the Basement Choir performed and that ex-service users volunteered to help by making cakes, providing food and making the difficult decision to share their experiences with the general public.  Their actions were really appreciated by us all.”

Support for people needing help with alcohol and drug use in Leeds is changing with a new integrated service being delivered from 1st July.
To make sure people wanting support, advice or more intensive interventions get the help they need, Forward Leeds are bringing together a range of expert organisations in the city to provide help to those struggling with their use of drink or drugs, as well as making sure prevention and early intervention help is available. The service will be available to support anyone who misuses drugs or may be at risk of being dependent on alcohol.
Lisa Parker, Executive Director of Forward Leeds, is delighted. She said:
“We know recovery based on inspiration and motivation makes a big difference, and it will be at the heart of the services we offer. The new service will ensure those at risk of alcohol and drug misuse have the greatest chance of avoiding dependency and we will also place an emphasis on peer-led recovery, where people will help each other to recover.
“We’re proud the partners delivering this service have come together with such a passion to deliver a first class service for the people of Leeds.”
Councillor Lisa Mulherin, Leeds City Council Executive Member for Health, Wellbeing and Adults said:
“Misuse of drugs and alcohol has a huge impact on individuals, children, families and communities in Leeds. Not only do they damage the health and wellbeing of individuals, but they damage the quality of life, life chances and safety of children and families of those who are misusing substances.
“As well as this, we know there is a big impact on crime and anti-social behaviour, lost productivity and wider costs to the health, social care and the criminal justice systems.
“I welcome the opportunities the new services delivered by Forward Leeds will give to individuals and communities in the city dealing with problem use of alcohol and drugs. It is a great example of the council, Clinical Commissioning Groups and third sector linking together to make a positive difference to the city.”
The new service aims to reduce the number of people who become dependent on alcohol or drugs in the first place, and access to the service through participating GPs will mean people can discuss their situation with their doctor as well as making contact with the service directly.
Dr Ian Cameron, Leeds City Council Director of Public Health, said:
“Forward Leeds will be able to use their considerable expertise at helping people not to misuse alcohol and drugs. With their background in reducing risk taking behaviour, they will be well placed to provide the right support for people struggling with alcohol and drug use, as well as making sure there is awareness, advice and training for communities. We also know there is a particular need to work with marginalised groups.”
The service will also provide recovery support to help more people to achieve and sustain recovery from alcohol and drug misuse through a range of treatment and support options. For more information please telephone 0113 887 2477 or visit the website www.forwardleeds.co.uk

Families First invited to the Commons

Leeds Families First visit to the House of Commons
The Leeds Families First service – the city’s successful partnership which works to deliver the Government’s Troubled Families programme – has sent a representative to speak at a UK Government Cabinet Task Force meeting in the House of Commons.
Lead Practitioner for the DISC-managed service, Becky Baxter, said: “I was asked personally by the DCLG [Department for Communities and Local Government] to speak at the task force meeting about the project and to discuss any difficulties that we encounter.”
Becky’s audience included Iain Duncan Smith, Ed Timpson, Oliver Letwin, Lord Heseltine, Greg Clark and Baroness Williams.
Becky explained: “The ministers were able to ask questions and to hear some real life examples of what it is like for practitioners and families on the ground.  This was extremely important as it was the first time that a practitioner, had been asked to present at a Cabinet task force meeting.”
Becky added: “Representing our work in this way is invaluable as it can influence how the much-needed program is funded in future. It gives Cabinet Ministers a real understanding of how the programme operates and benefits the families we are working with.
“I have since had excellent feedback from this visit and I hope that we are able to continue to deliver support for those families most in need.”
The Families First programme is commissioned by Leeds City Council and delivered by DISC, Barnardos, Health for All, Shantona and Re’New. It supports families that have been recognised as having generational unemployment, crime and Anti social behaviour and low attendance at school; with an expanded programme incorporating Domestic Violence, Mental Health, Substance Misuse and CWNH (Children who need help).
The charity Developing Initiatives Supporting Communities (DISC) takes a lead in delivering the programme and is proud to support Leeds City Council in co-ordinating the Families First Offer across the city.
DISC Young People and Families Senior Manager, Rachel Conner said: “I am immensely proud of Becky and the DISC Families First Team.
“I am pleased that their hard work and dedication in working with some of the most complex and disadvantaged families in Leeds has been recognised by our commissioners and Cabinet including the Prime Minister David Cameron.
“It is testament to our Families First team that they were selected from Troubled Families Teams across the country and given the opportunity to represent the families they work with and talk directly to Cabinet Ministers.”
DISC practitioners work intensely with the whole family, co coordinating a TAF (Team around the Family); developing action plans to help to improve opportunities and outcomes for families. The Families First project has been very successful in Leeds and has received national recognition for supporting some of the most complex families and achieving positive and sustained outcomes.
Families First- DISC works closely with Forward Leeds Drug and Alcohol Service and are integrated within the Forward Leeds model. DISC have three staff based within the Forward Leeds West Hub.

Shouting about our quality
by CEO Paul Townsley







 
Home » Shouting about our quality





								Monday 11th April 2016							


CEO Blog


Shouting about our quality
I went off to do two days’ training on Inspire and Engage at the end of March with a great training organisation called Maynard Leigh. I had won a free course at one of their events where five people got a gold ticket in their programme – yes, I felt like Charlie Bucket when I got it. (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory).
What I learnt about myself and DISC and our field is that we need to start shouting more about all the great works we are doing. As essential services for our communities and vulnerable people are being cut and axed almost like they were not much good or needed anyway, it’s never been as important to shout about how great and needed our services are.
We need to fight
No one knows if we will have any funding or jobs in 3-5 years’ time and what the state of our communities will be. What’s tending to happen now is a movement to ‘dothing’ our collective caps and being grateful for what we can salvage or hold on to. Morale is low. What we need to do is fight for the services that our clients and communities need.
I did the training to be better at shouting up for our clients and communities and fighting for their needs. I see our staff doing this all the time.
Motivated to help people
I think that we do so much in social care and in DISC that needs protecting and building on and it feels like leaders are too passive at the moment. I have always believed in quietly going about our work but think I need to start standing up for what we believe in and speaking out more.
At our best, people behave in a similar way at DISC, they:

Come to work motivated to help people with their skills
Focus on the needs of our service users not themselves
Work inside and outside DISC well – collaboratively
Constantly review and develop and learn
Want to innovate and try new stuff

A sense of value
There is so much good work going on across other charities and DISC that each day in these challenging times I think we need to stop to take a moment as we are driving, on our way to a meeting to a group or one to one or home visit with a service user and sing a line of we’re great and we know we are. Not through arrogance but to keep a sense of value at a time when we are at our most challenged.
Paul Townsley
DISC CEO

Lord Lieutenant Celebrates Launch of Horizon Project at DISC

								Friday 15th April 2016							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


A half million pound, Big Lottery-funded project aimed at helping young people who carry out caring duties for relatives in County Durham and Darlington has been launched by The Lord Lieutenant of County Durham.
The £492,221 Horizon Young Adult Carers Service is a new service designed to support young adult carers aged 14-25 who live in County Durham and Darlington. The Service is delivered by local charity DISC in association with Consett YMCA and the Cornforth Partnership.
The main aims of the service are to provide young carers with access to community based support services, to improve confidence amongst young carers, promote wellbeing and increase the aspirations of young carers to allow them to realise their full potential.
The Lord Lieutenant of County Durham, Mrs Sue Snowdon, said: “Horizon is absolutely the name for this project.  It’s innovative and ground breaking, because its primary objective is to give young adult carers every opportunity, every assistance to expand their horizons, to reach their full potential”.
The service will complete comprehensive assessments to identify and meet the individual support needs of young carers accessing the service.
As well as support for individual carers through a dedicated helpline open between 10am – 9pm Monday to Friday, the service will also engage with families of young carers to allow access to support groups and family activities. The programme will also work with up to 70 County Durham and Darlington agencies to increase their understanding of issues surrounding young carers and to improve their interaction with young carers.
Paul Townsley, Chief Executive of DISC, said: “We’re delighted to launch this new service for the Young Carers of County Durham and Darlington. By working with The Cornforth Partnership and Consett YMCA, we’re really looking forward to ensuring that young carers and their families receive the support they deserve, allowing them to increase their independence and improve access to vital services.”
The £492,221 funding for the three year project was provided by The Big Lottery. DISC already has significant experience of project delivery in this field, having already delivered the Horizon Young Adult Carers service across County Durham. DISC also currently deliver Darlington Young Carers Service which provides a valuable service to Young Carers across Darlington.

Scarborough’s Cambridge Centre merges with DISC

Merger is “good news for our service users”
People who receive help from the Scarborough-based Cambridge Centre charity have been reassured that the services they use will continue unaffected as it merges with a larger charity this week.
The Cambridge Centre, which is based in Alma Square in the town, is merging with the Northern charity, DISC, one of the North’s most innovative social care providers.
The two organisations have worked closely together on North Yorkshire substance misuse services for the past eighteen months. They have been in merger talks since last summer.
Nikki Orrell, of the Cambridge Centre said: “This merger is good news for our service users. We have made sure that service users will not be affected as we move forward. All the services we run will carry on as normal.” Ms Orrell said services would continue to be run at the Women’s Community Project on Northway in Scarborough.
Nikki said: “We are delighted to take a really good partnership into a more strategic alliance that allows us to deliver greater social value in North Yorkshire and use the experience and skills of The Cambridge Centre to develop our housing, specialist women’s and offender services.”
Paul Townsley, Chief Executive of DISC – Developing Initiatives Supporting Communities – said the merger would benefit existing service users and create the potential to help more people. He said: “To fully achieve the strategic ambitions of both organisations and whilst in a strong position, it was felt a good time to merge.”
The organisations have worked with funders of the services to ensure their views were fully considered in the plans, and consultations are on-going with affected staff.
Both charities have been working since the mid-1980s to provide services for the vulnerable and disadvantaged in local communities.
DISC currently employs 450 staff from its headquarters in County Durham, and in service provision across the North East, Yorkshire, the Humber and the North West. Services include those for children and young people, LGBT support, housing services, offender rehabilitation and drug and alcohol misuse programmes.
The Cambridge Centre has a twenty nine year history of providing high quality drug, alcohol, women’s and offender services to the community within North Yorkshire.

DISC strikes Gold in Better Health at Work Awards
A successful Newton Aycliffe-based charity has achieved a new Gold standard – in the Better Health at Work Awards.
Clare Singlewood on behalf of communities charity, DISC received the coveted Gold award last night at a ceremony at Ramside Hall Hotel, near Durham.
She was part of a delegation from DISC, including Chief Executive, Paul Townsley.
Mr Townsley said: “We are delighted to be amongst the first to strike Gold in the Better Health at Work Awards.
“DISC recognises that the health and wellbeing of the staff is as important as that of our service users.
“The whole purpose of the award is to help staff and the wider community in whatever way we can to be happy and healthy – which has its own benefits”
And Ms Singlewood added: “We have achieved the award through constant awareness-raising, campaigns and promotions.”
The award was handed out by Durham County Councillor Lucy Hovvels, who holds the Adult and Health Services portfolio for the council, and who praised DISC for its work.
The Gold level award builds on the Silver award the organisation already holds and required DISC to spread its health and wellbeing message to the wider community.
The organisation had to demonstrate it had a three year health strategy and a year-long action plan for health improvement activities and task-related health issues.
DISC had to show it participates in local, regional and national health initiatives.
The organisation, which has some 450 staff,  also had to show it encourages regular staff health checks, supports people on long term sickness to return to work, has robust, reviewed policies in place on preventing bullying and harassment, has environmental management systems in place, and demonstrates its innovation in maintaining the health and wellbeing of its staff.

Employment, Training and Education


A local Cricket Club has been bowled over by the hard work and dedication of four local teenagers as it gets ready for the new season.
Four learners from DISC’s Steps 4 Success Study Programme have carried out painting jobs and helped with repairs during a week-long placement at Shildon Railway Cricket Club on Hackworth Street.
John Brennan, Club Secretary for Shildon Railway Cricket Club, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work carried out by the learners and hope that we can support DISC in the future. It has been a pleasure to help these young people and wish each of them every success in the future”.
And he added: “Our club has been pleased to support the excellent work that DISC does with young people in our community.”
The learners completed a range of jobs including repairing and painting the boundary fence, painting benches, screens and the score box as well as preparing the ground for the new cricket season in April.
Janeen Colville, a Coordinator for DISC, worked with Shildon Railway Cricket Club to develop the work experience opportunity. She said: “Our learners declared an interest in the painting and decorating or ground maintenance industry. I spoke to the cricket club and they immediately agreed to support us, which was fantastic.”
“Our programme are designed to bridge the gap between education and employment and by taking part, young people are able to learn the skills and behaviours needed to secure employment.
“DISC work placements are a vital part of a learners programme and we are grateful to Shildon Railway Cricket Club for helping us nurture our learners’ interests and talents”.

From Theory to Practice
DISC CEO Paul Townsley at the WY-FI annual conference 2016
The DISC-led WY-FI project has held its annual conference in Leeds.
It attracted nationally renowned voices, including Lord Adebowale, to address the theme of From Theory to Practice, working with people with multiple needs.
WY-FI annual conference
Speaking at the WY-FI annual conference, DISC’s chairman Jim Black said: “What’s so important for me is that we don’t assume where people are or what other people need. The WY-FI project is about engaging with people about what they want from their journey.”
And he said: “It’s so positive to hear about multi-agency working being put into practice. This can never be a short-term fix though. Multi-agency working has to be here for the longer-term.”
West Yorkshire—Finding Independence (WY-FI) is trying to improve the lives of people who have multiple needs. The service is a partnership of  specialist organisations led by DISC. It covers Calderdale, Leeds, Bradford, Kirklees and Wakefield.

More Time Volunteers Seek Extra Donations







 
Home » More Time Volunteers Seek Extra Donations





								Wednesday 04th May 2016							


Social Enterprise


A call has gone out for more donations of furniture and white goods for a local social enterprise set up to help local people.
Gavin Bestford and Susan Hill both volunteer for More Time, and say a steady stream of customers at the showroom in the DISC headquarters next to the Blue Bridge on the town means they need more good quality second-hand goods.
Gavin, from Newton Aycliffe, said: “We’re always on the lookout for new stock – it’s the lifeblood of our service.
“We’re always looking for more household goods and we have the skills within the team here at More Time to refurbish old furniture and white goods to bring them back to standard. The furniture and white goods are then tested and sold on to local people who may need quality goods but prefer not to buy them in the shops.”
Fellow volunteer Susan said: “I want to encourage local people to get in touch if they have any furniture or white goods that they no longer want. We offer a free collection service and are happy to travel and see what people wish to donate.”
All the money raised from the sale of these goods goes back into the More Time service, helping local people develop new skills in retail, sales, catering and cleaning with the aim of them securing employment in the future.
And Susan said “If anyone is struggling with low confidence, this is an excellent place to volunteer to work alongside a great group of people who make you feel really welcome.”
People who would like to donate household goods are encouraged to telephone 01325 731294. More Time is based at The IES Centre –Horndale Avenue, Aycliffe Business Park (near the Blue Bridge), The More Time furniture store is open Monday to Saturday between 9am until 4pm.
More Time Furniture Scheme provides good quality second-hand furniture at reasonable prices, enabling local people to source the furniture they need, with a cost effective delivery option for those people who don’t have access to a delivery van.  It also provides fully certified house clearance services for those people who need to have bulky/unwanted items removed from their property.

Let’s get physical

								Friday 20th May 2016							


CEO Blog


Maintaining the buzz at DISC
As I sit here writing this month’s blog, I do so with a dull ache in one of my big toes. I fractured it going for a shot I should not have gone for in a game of tennis. It’s been repairing well but I have started playing tennis again a bit too soon. This has a relevance because I am writing the blog to recognise the excellent work of DISC staff in achieving Gold Standard at the Better Health at Work Awards across the North East.
When I came to work for DISC, I noticed some interesting communication going on. My first ever email informed me about a discount at the barbers next to our office. My first trip to the loo led me to see information on healthy shades of ‘pee’ and quitting smoking in Stoptober. Another buzz erupted in my first week at DISC as staff did squat o clock.
A group of staff just got on with it
CEO Paul Townsley and DISC workers Clare Singlewood, Sara Allen and Janeen Colville at the BHAWA event
As a member of staff, it showed me DISC had an interest in my health and made me think a bit about my health.
Like most good initiatives at work this is led by a group of staff that just get on with it and do it. It’s not a corporate ‘top down’ initiative. As a result of Better Health at Work initiatives I drink more water during the day, smoke ‘socially’ less and do a bit more exercise.
Most of the jobs that staff and volunteers do at DISC can have a negative impact on our health. Whether due to sitting down at desks, working on computers, driving long miles, or the pressures and stresses of working with difficult and challenging issues. We have a responsibility to look after ourselves and for DISC to do its bit to look after the health of our staff.
A new Gold standard
We want to follow up the Better Health at Work Gold Award with more campaigns to raise awareness across all DISC services. We’re looking for Better Health at Work champions in all our sites now.  I’d like to place on record my thanks to the Health Advocate Team for the drive that has made this work, to date.
As me and my toe know, keeping healthy can be a pain. But it’s worth it. It’s fun. It helps maintain the buzz we have here and we won’t rest.
Paul Townsley
Chief Executive Officer, DISC

Recovery Academy Opens in Leeds
A community centre has opened in Leeds to create a new focal point for people recovering from alcohol and drug addiction in the city.
The peer-led Recovery Academy, which is in a converted chapel on Hollis Place, off Burley Road, offers activities, including gardening, art, music, employment advice and on-going help to individuals in recovery.
It’s also aimed at providing help and support for families, friends and carers who have been affected by drug and alcohol misuse.
The chapel was bought by Northern communities’ charity Developing Initiatives Supporting Communities (DISC), the lead delivery partner of Forward Leeds, the city’s alcohol and drug service
Diane Powell, Leeds City Council, Public Health and Forward Leeds Executive Director Lisa Parker
Lisa Parker, Executive Director for Forward Leeds, said: “We believe the opening of the Recovery Academy is a significant milestone for Leeds.
“It’s here to build on the vibrant recovery networks that already exist here in Leeds.”
Ms Parker said local service users had identified that one of the barriers to achieving and sustaining recovery was finding the right place to receive continuing support after treatment.
The new Academy offers a range of courses and activities from 9am-7pm, Monday to Friday.  It offers activities that service users have identified as being the most helpful in making their recovery sustainable.

They thinks it’s all over – it isn’t
by CEO Paul Townsley







 
Home » They thinks it’s all over – it isn’t





								Monday 04th July 2016							


CEO Blog


Momentous events
We live in strange and uncertain times. With momentous and tragic events happening at home and abroad  in recent weeks, it can be difficult to see any upside.
Like the plot of the book Fever Pitch and Nick Hornby’s life events unfolding as Arsenal win the league, key events and episodes in my life  often seem to be played out with Football’s European Championships and the World Cup in the background.
Light hearted
Jeremy Corbyn and Paul Townsley
As I was going home to watch England v Wales, I bumped into Jeremy Corbyn at Sheffield Railway Station. He was really relaxed and light-hearted and we look like old friends on this snap. Just half an hour later, one of his MPs was murdered in West Yorkshire.
A week after this, my partner and I and our two kids came down as if on a weird Christmas morning – waiting for each other before opening the living room door. Instead of Christmas presents we turned on the TV to see Nigel Farage and the news that we were leaving the EU. Then the PM resigned.
Never forget
No matter what happens now many people, like me, will never forget where we were that day.
Less than a week later another suicide attack kills many people in Istanbul. In this context watching England’s performance against Iceland was almost reassuring and comforting.
With such large events taking place, what the heck does this mean for DISC. It even feels strange linking it together. Nevertheless, I will try to.
Significant margin
The North voted to leave the EU by a significant  margin in working class estates where I live in Sheffield, the turnout was far higher than for any  local or general election. For me, the vote is a clear statement that many people in the North are disillusioned – with little hope and belief in theirs and their children’s lives and future – and want to take back control.
Ours and many other charities’ work is about giving people hope and belief – and making life better for future generations. We do this in the most challenging environments. We cannot influence the bigger events but we can have an impact on the communities, families and service users we work with. Our job is to take small, positive steps in our work all the time.
Hope for the future
The uncertainty we face with ongoing cuts, the brunt of which are in the North, has now increased. There are positives as well as the negatives. But insecurity is everywhere.
DISC will continue to engage with what all our beneficiaries need.
In these strange and uncertain times, a lot of people find it difficult to see hope for the future. At DISC, we work with such people every day.  And with their motivation and skills and a bit of support from DISC, we see those people making monumental, positive changes in their lives. At this time we need to be glass half-full people more than ever.
Paul Townsley
DISC CEO

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services



Forward Leeds celebrates First Anniversary
Nearly 6,000 people have accessed drug and alcohol services run by Forward Leeds since it launched in the city a year ago. Forward Leeds, the Leeds City Council commissioned service has helped a total of 5,889 people since it began operating in July, 2015.

It responds to over a hundred calls a day, assisting clients and professionals with alcohol and drug advice, appointments, referrals and other general enquiries.
Forward Leeds, Executive Director, Lisa Parker said: “We have managed to make a really positive contribution to the lives of so many people in the city.
“Leeds is rightly thought of as one of the best places in the country to get support to recover.
“Since we launched last July, we have steadily grown our services and become very well known throughout the city.
“We’ve run effective public health campaigns such as Like My Limit, which informs people about the health harms of alcohol. We have also been delighted with the positive feedback we’ve received about the recent Illegal Highs campaign, which raises awareness of the potentially fatal risk posed by former ‘legal highs’. We have also launched a new Recovery Academy in Burley, for people of Leeds in recovery.
“We have achieved so much already and next year looks even more exciting.”
Councillor Charlwood (Executive Member for Health, Wellbeing and Adults), said: “Forward Leeds has used their first year to provide welcome new services which integrate drug and alcohol service for the city. At a time when there are significant pressures on health and care resources we have to find innovative ways to link prevention and support people through treatment and into recovery, providing information and education around health and the impact of drugs and alcohol.
“Through its offer of a range of services, Forward Leeds has supported many people, including families, across the city and as it celebrates its first year since it began operating, I look forward to the service continuing to play its part in Leeds commitment to improving health for everyone and reducing health inequalities.”
The new Recovery Academy was launched last month, with funding awarded by Public Health England to charity Developing Initiatives Supporting Communities (DISC), the lead delivery partner of Forward Leeds.
The academy, in a converted chapel on Hollis Place just off Burley Road, offers activities such as art, music, IT, peer support, employment and education skills, and on-going support as well as opportunities to contribute to Leeds, after overcoming substance dependence.
Forward Leeds operates from four main hubs, at Kirkgate and the Market Place in the city centre, one in Seacroft and one in Armley. The services can also be accessed through the single point of contact 0113 887 2477, GP surgeries and community services across Leeds.

Recruitment


Successful service seeks new staff
A service that runs recovery and treatment provision for alcohol and drug addictions is to recruit more staff to meet local demand.
North Yorkshire Horizons is holding a jobs fair at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough from 3pm on 25th May.
The event is being promoted by DISC, one of the lead partners in the North Yorkshire Horizons drug and alcohol project.
Nicky Booth, Scarborough Cluster Manager at North Yorkshire Horizons, said: “We are looking to recruit seven more members to join our dedicated and inspiring team. Scarborough is the busiest of all our services across North Yorkshire, and the area has the most varying type of problem substances recorded across the county.
“The Scarborough Hub has supported nearly one-third of all client episodes across North Yorkshire since October 2014, and the area has the most varying types of problem substances recorded, with 62 different drug types in total.”
“We’ve been really successful in promoting the services at Horizons, and that success has meant that we need to recruit more staff to ensure our services continue to be available to all.”
“By holding this recruitment event, we’re looking to increase awareness about the opportunities to work for Horizons and would like people from across the region to visit the fair and speak to staff.”
Support for the North Yorkshire Horizons service comes from service users, their friends and loved ones. Debby, whose partner has accessed services from Horizons, said “The service here at North Yorkshire Horizons is very supportive. It’s good that everything’s under one roof… it’s a good place to come to it doesn’t feel clinical at all, it’s a friendly atmosphere, (with) some very down to earth staff.”
If you would like to work in a friendly environment and really make a difference to the lives of people across Scarborough, visit the recruitment event on Wednesday 25th May at The Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough between 3pm – 7pm, where Project Workers from North Yorkshire Horizons and Human Resources staff will be on hand to answer questions and facilitate applications.
A variety of jobs are currently advertised, from Assessment Workers to Recovery Co-ordinators, in both full-time and part-time roles.
For more information on the jobs available, please visit www.nyhorizons.org.uk/join-us/ for more information about the latest vacancies, or call 01325 731160 and speak to one of our dedicated HR staff.

MP’s Praise for DISC’s Work with Young Unemployed in County Durham

								Friday 17th June 2016							


DISC News
Employment, Training and Education


MP impressed by 91% success rate
Workers at a local charity running a BIG Lottery to get young people into work and training, have been praised by their local MP after achieving a 91% success rate.
Northern Communities charity DISC run the Talent Match programme  in County Durham for local young people aged between 18 and 24 who are long term unemployed.
Out of 120 young people they have worked with since the DISC project launched in June 2014, 64 have received more education and training and 45 have found a job.
Sedgefield Phil Wilson MP said: “This is excellent news. DISC has done so much to reach young people and help them achieve employment and training.  Ninety one per cent is an amazingly high figure. Congratulations to everyone involved.
And he added: “DISC is a credit to the community.”
DISC’s Youth Coach, Kate Thompson, said: “Even those who have not yet managed to get into employment, training or education with us have gained new skills and moved closer to the labour market”.
The programme works with individuals to provide tailored support, enabling increased confidence by involving the individual in work experience, up skilling and volunteering.
The young people may face barriers such as lack of qualifications, lack of confidence, homelessness and drug and alcohol use. They may attend at DISC’s offices on Horndale Avenue, Newton Aycliffe but youth coaches also meet young people in local community centres, cafes and libraries.
Kate said: “Once successful in moving someone forward, we don’t just abandon them – DISC’s Talent Match staff stay in frequent touch through one to one appointments, phone and social media to ensure continued support.
“We see our service users’ confidence grow and we’re always excited and proud to see how they take on the world from there.”
Kieran, of Newton Aycliffe, who began work at Pound World in Darlington in the Spring said Talent Match’s input was invaluable.
Kieran said: “I’m a much more confident person now – when I first joined the group I was quiet but now I can’t stop talking. I was recently described as a natural at customer service by a mystery shopper – this would have been unthinkable before I joined Talent Match. It did me the world of good and I would recommend it to everyone.”

DISC welcomes talks with new Government

								Friday 12th August 2016							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


Northern Communities charity DISC has welcomed an early move to discuss the new government’s approach to drugs and alcohol issues.
Lisa Parker, Executive Director for DISC, said she welcomed planned meetings by Collective Voice with key government officials in the Autumn.
Lisa Parker of DISC, at Forward Leeds Kirkgate site
Ms Parker said: “It is vital that the new government hear our collective voice, which speaks to improve drug and alcohol services.”
“DISC is proud to be one of nine voluntary sector organisations in Collective Voice which came together to ensure that the voices of the drug and alcohol recovery sector and those who use our services are represented effectively.”
As well as discussing the government’s new approach to alcohol and drugs, the roundtable discussions will cover:

The implementation challenges of delivering the key role assigned to drug and alcohol treatment in the Government’s Modern Crime Prevention Strategy published in March.
The timing and likely content of the delayed 2016-refreshed Drug Strategy, and the opportunities that may flow from this.
The structural and financial challenges the sector faces, and potential solutions.
Developing and emerging trends.

DISC is a partner in a number of innovative drug and alcohol treatment services across the north of England. For more information please visit www.disc-vol.org.uk

BIG Lottery funding for Young Adult Carers







 
Home » BIG Lottery funding for Young Adult Carers





								Monday 16th November 2015							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


Half a million pound funding from Big Lottery
Northern charity DISC has secured nearly half a million pounds funding through BIG Lottery funding to deliver a new service across Darlington and County Durham which will provide support and advice to young adult carers.  The service is delivered in partnership with DISC (Developing Initiatives Supporting Communities) The Cornforth Partnership and Consett YMCA, with a value of £492,000 over three years.
Paul Townsley, Chief Executive at DISC, said: “We’re delighted to have been awarded this fund by BIG Lottery. With our previous experience of running a similar service across County Durham, we’re understandably confident that we can deliver even more targeted support to those young people who need our help.”
“We’re thankful that the BIG Lottery have recognized the potential for this service and the support it offers to young carers. Following a meeting with the Big Lottery and our local MP Phil Wilson, it’s great to have such positive groups working in partnership for the benefit of young people in this area.”
Phil Wilson, the MP for Sedgefield recently visited DISC to discuss their successful Big Lottery projects and is delighted that DISC have secured this new funding.
He said “It’s excellent news for the Young Carers and this latest award will provide much needed support for those who need it across the county. We know that many of these young people have such a responsible position in looking after loved ones, so a project like this that gives them the support they need is to be welcomed”.
The service will look to support the transition of young adult carers aged 14-25. A care-planned, key worker approach is at the core of the service and will seek to enable young carers to identify aspirations, set goals and receive on-going support to address needs, reduce care responsibilities and increase life choices.
The Young Adult Carers Project is aimed to help vulnerable young people aged 14-25 to lead active and fulfilling lives by funding local projects and national learning and awareness raising initiatives. The project will give young people a voice and help them to access the advice and services that will support their day-to-day lives, including education, housing, healthcare and employment.
This intensive intervention will be complemented by lighter touch advice and information and by developing the capacity of the relevant local workforce, such as schools, training providers and health care agencies to better understand and address young carer’s issues and aspirations, as well as developing the training and support given to peer mentors.

Changing the world for the better
by CEO Paul Townsley







 
Home » Changing the world for the better





								Wednesday 31st August 2016							


CEO Blog


Connecting with communities
Recently, I was really pleased to attend a parliamentary group on Complex Needs and Dual Diagnosis with a focus on older people.
It was held in that new tourist attraction, the Westminster bubble!
I don’t know about exiting from Europe but after that day’s visit, I think I’d like to opt out of the bubble…
Parliament, it seems to me, is disconnected from the communities that we work in and the needs of the people it serves. The place itself and the way in which it operates has to change to make it feel more connected to our communities.
A window of opportunity
Nevertheless, there is a sense in which DISC and other charities have a window of opportunity now to change the way we make decisions and spend money and make people who feel powerless, have power.
I am full of admiration for the people who serve in public office and we want to be right there, sitting at the big tables influencing policy. Our local MP Phil Wilson, for example, does a lot of work to support DISC and its local initiatives in County Durham.
So we are not talking about the people – it’s the systems that need to change. To really impact on all our lives, government needs to fundamentally connect with local communities and be representative of their views.
Charities and large businesses have also got the same issues. While what we do and who does it has changed dramatically, our operating context has not. Charity and charities have never been more needed. So we need to learn from the way businesses operate, but not mimic them. Charities are about social value, not profit. Therefore, DISC’s operating environment is governed by how much value we bring to our service user or community, not to profit levels.
Clearer value for money
The balance is difficult to maintain because we do need to break even and find money to invest in reserves and cover cost of living increases. Our focus, however, needs to be on the social value we bring. Charities will have a large role in future health and social care economies with NHS and private sector colleagues. Our role is making sure services meet the changing needs of our communities.
I would like to see more money available to organisations looking to change services in the challenging climate of fewer resources. At DISC, we plan to work with our core partners, service users and communities to develop services offering clearer value for money in early intervention and prevention services and integrated service offers for the most vulnerable and complex.
By Paul Townsley
DISC Chief Executive Officer

Team GB’s medal haul in Rio has inspired the watching DISC service users at the Greens in Sheffield to create their own Olympic flame – beneath a barbeque grill.
Workers and residents at the unit rolled out the red, white and blue bunting and celebrated in style.
Project Leader Marie Dodds said: “We thought it might be good to do something to celebrate the Rio Olympics and so we decided to have a barbecue at the project.

“One of the service users, Andy E did some excellent art work of the Olympic Logo, and other service users helped with the food –  Sammie baked lots of cakes and made delicious salads, and Aaron and Andy M were on barbecue duty cooking delicious food.
“We did an Olympic Quiz which was won by Mervyn. I think everyone enjoyed sharing some social time with the staff team and also the delicious food.
“The service users also liked the challenge of the quiz and didn’t think they would get so many of the questions right – they were having fun sharing the answers with each other. We got a lot of positive

Leeds Round Table Event with Government







 
Home » Leeds Round Table Event with Government





								Thursday 08th September 2016							


DISC News


Collective Voice is organising a round table event to bring together Recovery Services with key representatives from the government to consult on the governments approach to drugs and alcohol.
The event on 6 October is being hosted by DISC at its Leeds Recovery Centre at The Old Chapel, 43 Westfield Road, Leeds LS3 1NQ.
If your organisation would like to take part in this significant event please contact Kate Spark on 01325 731 160 or email kate.spark@disc-vol.org.uk by 29 September, 2016.
Leeds Recovery Academy (satnav Hollis Place/Westfield Road, Leeds, LS3 1NQ)
Please note that due to demand we may need to restrict attendance to one place per organisation. Lunch will be provided.
Collective Voice is a project backed by a group of the UK’s largest third sector substance misuse service providers.
The volatile political situation, a new Prime Minister and cabinet, and the impact of Brexit on public expenditure have major implications for the continued delivery of adequately resourced, evidenced and effective alcohol and drug treatment.
The immediate consequence of recent events is that the delayed 2016 Drug Strategy refresh will probably need to be revisited by the incoming
Home Office ministerial team, pushing back
publication until later in the year. In our view the sector cannot afford to wait until the drug strategy is published before it collectively considers how to respond to the challenges the emerging political landscape represents.
The Collective Voice group includes Addaction, Blenheim, Change, Grow, Live, Cranstoun, DISC, Lifeline Project, Phoenix Futures, Swanswell and Turning Point.

Home » DISC recognised as an Investor in People





								Tuesday 20th September 2016							


DISC News


DISC has been awarded silver accreditation against the Investors in People Standard, demonstrating their commitment to high performance through good people management.
The organisation, which has over 500 people and 80 volunteers, has an annual turnover of £23m. It has more than 35 delivery centres across the North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humberside. DISC ‘s services cover areas such drugs and alcohol, housing related support, housing, employment, training and education, health and well-being, children, young people and families, women, criminal justice and community and offender rehabilitation.  It also runs the MoreTime social enterprise.
Investors in People is the international standard for people management, defining what it takes to lead, support and manage people effectively to achieve sustainable results. Underpinning the Standard is the Investors in People framework, reflecting the latest workplace trends, essential skills and effective structures required to outperform in any industry. Investors in People enables organisations to benchmark against the best in the business on an international scale.
Paul Devoy, Head of Investors in People, said: “We’d like to congratulate DISC. Investors in People accreditation is the sign of a great employer, an outperforming place to work and a clear commitment to success. DISC should be extremely proud of their achievement.”
Commenting on the award, Judith MacPherson, Director of Central Support Services at DISC, said: “We have demonstrated our commitment to high performance through good people management.
“Silver accreditation is expected to be awarded only to the top 5 percentile of organisations assessed.
“This is a fantastic achievement for DISC, especially bearing in mind the significant growth and change to the composition of the workforce that has been experienced recently.”
The charity’s Chief Executive Officer Paul Townsley said: “Achieving IIP Silver is a great affirmation of DISC.
“This accreditation reinforces our view of the high levels of competence and dedication in our workforce. It also highlights the strength of our management systems and processes and that our plans to improve are robust and match IIP’s criteria.”

Thanks for everything, Avril
by CEO Paul Townsley







 
Home » Thanks for everything, Avril





								Thursday 29th September 2016							


CEO Blog


A unique blend of talents
This piece is about Avril Tully who retires as Executive Director at DISC this week. Avril is keen to point out this retirement is early largely to reflect her youth. She wants to travel and have adventures and spend time with her family, particularly her grandchildren.
Avril with grandson, Joseph.
It’s great that this is a cheerio for now, rather than a goodbye for ever. Avril is going to come back to provide senior interim management in between her frequent trips. She is currently an Executive Director and has worked for DISC in a variety of roles since 1992. In the time since Avril joined DISC, we’ve  had huge growth both in terms of the range of our services and their scope.
I first met Avril in 2007 in Bradford Town Hall when we were both mobilising services for our organisations. In Avril’s case, this was DISC. When I first saw her, she was clearly kind but someone you did not mess with. She represented services and the area but also DISC and its beneficiaries.  A difficult balance to pull off, but Avril is one of the few people I have come across that pulls it off.
Formidable and impressive
I cannot talk about Avril and her achievements since 1992 at DISC. I can describe the Avril I knew outside of DISC and the one I have got to know since working for DISC.
As a delivery partner and a competitor, Avril was and is formidable and impressive. For the last 15 months, she has been a colleague and her leadership skills have been invaluable. The loss of her unique blend of talents will leave a hole in DISC.
As well as eating a packet of quavers each day at 11 am, one of her favourite sayings is ‘You’re joking!’  – normally in reaction to our merry go round of events across services. I have got to know and enjoy her quirks and passions.
Since coming to DISC, Avril has schooled me in all the different things that make our charity stand out from the others.
Particular qualities at DISC
Two particular qualities, imparted through  Avril’s tutelage, spring to mind.

DISC has a unique approach to working in partnership that includes working collectively rather than a top down approach. At times, this means letting partners take control of situations or work that we may want to do or handing projects or work over when others are better placed to continue it. Partnership work like this is more needed now than ever and in community services delivers much better social and health care services than the supply chain or lead/sub-contractor model.
In my experience in the third sector DISC also uniquely plans, reviews and shares its vision and strategic plans annually with all staff and volunteers. I did not grasp how this cycle engages managers, staff and service users across DISC and that people then feel valued and involved in key decisions and future plans. Avril helped me understand this and I could quickly see the power of this more collaborative and co-produced approach.

Avril helped create DISC and build its success. Her values and skills will be badly missed on a day-to-day basis. The core qualities of calmness and assuredness, being astute and having a strong sense of conviction are what make Avril unique.

North Yorkshire drug and alcohol service celebrates landmark.

								Tuesday 04th October 2016							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


Staff and service users from the drug and alcohol service North Yorkshire Horizons met at the Northallerton Hub to celebrate reaching a landmark figure for patients recovering from addiction.
Since it began delivering drug and alcohol recovery services on behalf of North Yorkshire County Council, North Yorkshire Horizons has discharged over 1000 people from the service having overcome their addiction.
“This is a major achievement for the service and illustrates just how successful it has been in supporting people to make significant changes to their daily lives that lead to complete recovery from drug and alcohol addiction” said County Councillor David Chance, Executive Member for Public Health and Stronger Communities
“North Yorkshire Horizons provides clinical treatment programmes and long and short term detoxification programs, as well as providing early intervention and prevention support. Combined with training, housing and opportunities for education and voluntary work, the service ensures people are able to concentrate on their bespoke recovery plan, giving them the best chance of successfully overcoming their addiction”.
Ted Haughey, Operations Director at North Yorkshire Horizons, is delighted by the success of the service. Ted said: “This milestone number translates into over 1000 individuals and their families having their lives transformed by the work of North Yorkshire Horizons.”
“We’re proud of what we have achieved so far, but we’re not resting on our laurels. We’re developing new projects to help people move forward, from a new social enterprise scheme in Northallerton to founding a Recovery Café’s in Selby. Our tailored support programmes encourage individuals to take ownership of their recovery plan, and the number of people leaving the service free of addiction illustrates just how successful this approach has been.”
As well as celebrating this landmark figure, a recent Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection of the service was published and the report highlighted the excellent work being undertaken across the county.
The CQC report remarked on several areas of good practice, including the way; “Staff treated clients with compassion, dignity and respect, were non-judgement in their approach and protected their privacy and dignity.”
Amongst other positive findings, the report also noted; “The flexibility of the service allowed staff to engage with clients with a chaotic lifestyle and support them through recovery.”
Another great step forward for the service and the people we help.

Leeds Recovery Academy receives generous food donation from UNITE student housing







 
Home » Leeds Recovery Academy receives generous food donation from UNITE student housing





								Sunday 25th September 2016							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


The Leeds Recovery Academy, run by DISC  will be distributing tinned and dried food goods to its members after a generous food donation from UNITE student housing.
The Sustained Recovery Team – who are based at the Recovery Academy, which offers recovery support and education, training and employment opportunities to people in recovery from alcohol and use drug use –  will give the goods to members who are most in need.
Helen Mason, Recovery Champion at Forward Leeds, the city’s alcohol and drug service which operates out of the Recovery Academy, tells us “We are really grateful for the very generous donation from UNITE. There is loads of tinned and dried goods that we can make available to our members, who sometimes struggle to look after their health and wellbeing due to the increasing cost of food and reduction of social support.”
The team will also use the food donations to serve meals at upcoming events at the Recovery Academy.
Darryl Kerrigan, Service and Safety at UNITE student housing in Leeds is thrilled to be developing a relationship with the Recovery Academy and be able to support vulnerable people in the local community.
Darryl tells us “We are really glad that we can support a good cause in our community. Sometimes we struggle to donate the leftover food so it is great to find a willing partner in Forward Leeds and the Recovery Academy. We look forward to continue working with them in the future.”
Discussions are also currently being had about the possibility of UNITE staff volunteering for the service and donating the large amount of furniture to the Recovery Academy that the accommodation company often sends to landfill.

Home » Team DISC enters County Durham Workplace Games





								Thursday 15th September 2016							


DISC News


A team of workers and volunteers from DISC is getting ready to take part in the County Durham Workplace Games next month.
Team DISC has been entered for the Workplace Games, which is organised by County Durham Sport and takes place on Thursday 6th October at Durham School.
They’ll play sports like tennis, badminton, netball, shooting, rowing and indoor watersports, with prizes available for winners and a team t-shirt, goodie bag and dinner provided for each competitor.
Liane Taylor, Operations Director for Employment & Social Enterprise at DISC said: “We have entered a team to allow staff to enjoy the positive benefits of exercise, and also to foster a sense of team spirit and bonding. We’ve also got an eye on the trophy!”
The team is made up of staff from all sections of the organisation and includes men and women from across the age spectrum.
Leanne Smith, 20, from Newton Aycliffe, an apprentice administrator at DISC said: “It’ll be great to have a little friendly competition with other workplaces in County Durham.  I’m not too sporty but it should be a lot of fun.”

Talent Match helps more people find work and training







 
Home » Talent Match helps more people find work and training





								Monday 03rd October 2016							


DISC News
Employment, Training and Education


Two young men from County Durham who underwent a training scheme and  then were taken on by a local company have told unemployed over 18’s how they did it.
Kieron Johnson, 21 and Scott Musgrave, 25, both from Newton Aycliffe, spoke to visitors at the National Careers Service event in Bishop Auckland to encourage them to sign up to the Talent Match Scheme. Northern communities’ charity DISC runs the Talent Match programme in County Durham for local young people.
The scheme provides tailored support with job searches, funding, training and work experience for people aged between 18 and 24 who are struggling to find work.
Kieron said: “Before working with Talent Match, I was stuck in dead end jobs.
“Now, after working with people on-site with different trades and ages, I’m much more confident.
“I’m happy that I’ve got a real job that offers career progression and getting my Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) card means I can work on building sites across the country.”
Kieron now works for More Time, a not-for-profit social enterprise based in Newton Aycliffe. He spoke to young people who showed an interest in the programme.
Scott has also started working for More Time. He said “this is the first proper job  I’ve had. I never thought that I’d be able to do something like this. Or to be able to speak to other people to persuade them to get some good training.”
Kate Thompson, DISC’s Youth Coach, manages the Talent Match programme.
She said: “Kieron and Scott’s positive attitude helped recruit more than 30 people at the event for one-to-one sessions, to begin the process of securing training or employment.”
The event was organised by The National Careers Service and was held at Bishop Auckland Town Hall. As well as Talent Match, well-known organisations including the NHS, HM Revenue and Customs and The Army were also in attendance.

DISC’s Silver IIP accreditation a “tremendous achievement”







 
Home » DISC’s Silver IIP accreditation a “tremendous achievement”





								Thursday 06th October 2016							


DISC News


DISC is proud to have received a message from Sheila Warren, of Investors in People, following confirmation that our charity, with some 500 employees has achieved a Silver IIP accreditation after a stringent review of our policies and procedures. It has put us in the top 5 per cent of organisations assessed by the IIP.
Sheila Warren said: “It was a privilege to work with DISC on their recent IOnvestors in People assessment. Significant strengths were identified through a series of interviews with members of staff from across the organisation.
“It was apparent that the values of DISC underpin service delivery throughout the organisation and that the workforce is highly committed to ensuring that service users have a positive experience and positive outcomes. message
“There is also a strong appetite for continuous improvement and clear evidence that staff work collaboratively to share good practice. The award of Investors in People Silver accreditation is a tremendous achievement for DISC, and one that is richly deserved.”

Collective Voice meeting at DISC’s Recovery Academy







 
Home » Collective Voice meeting at DISC’s Recovery Academy





								Wednesday 19th October 2016							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


DISC’s Chief Executive Officer Paul Townsley and Executive Director, Lisa Parker hosted a Collective Voice round table event to bring together Recovery Services with key representatives from the government to consult on the government’s approach to drugs and alcohol. The successful event was staged at the Recovery Academy in Leeds.
Collective Voice is a project backed by a group of the UK’s largest third sector substance misuse service providers.
The volatile political situation, a new Prime Minister and cabinet, and the impact of Brexit on public expenditure have major implications for the continued delivery of adequately resourced, evidenced and effective alcohol and drug treatment.

The Collective Voice group includes Addaction, Blenheim, Change, Grow, Live, Cranstoun, DISC, Lifeline Project, Phoenix Futures, Swanswell and Turning Point.

DISC RECOVERY COMMUNITY CELEBRATED FACES AND VOICES OF RECOVERY AT HALTON RECOVERY WALK 
Members of staff and service users from DISC’s drug and alcohol projects based in North Yorkshire, Leeds, Manchester and Calderdale travelled to Merseyside on 10th September to take part in the UK Recovery Walk.
More than 40 people from Leeds’ drug and alcohol service Forward Leeds and the recently opened Recovery Academy on Hollis Place, off Burley Road, were joined by up to 50 others from The Space, Spacious Places, Learning to Live Again, Change Live Grow and Mabgate Mills.
Meanwhile, over 50 people from North Yorkshire’s drug and alcohol service North Yorkshire Horizons, and 35 from Recovery Steps Calderdale also took part.
DISC has continued to sponsorship the event again this year in recognition of the importance of it as a means of encouraging the recovery community to come together to celebrate success.
The event provided a chance for staff and service users to get together to meet people from other parts of the county to celebrate the achievements of individuals in recovery, and to acknowledge the work of prevention, treatment, and recovery service providers.
Lisa Parker, Executive Director at DISC said; “This is the largest number of people we’ve ever had sign up to attend the Recovery Walk.”
“It was a chance to highlight the citizenship of groups and to show they have joined together to publicise their journey to recovery. Lots of people attended the Durham event last year and it was great fun, so everyone was really looking forward to the event again this year.”
Funding for the coaches was awarded by DISC, with £450 donated by the charity from its Service User Fund to help groups attend the event.

Nurse becomes “Nurse Leader of the Year” at  top healthcare awards

 Karen’s caring work wins national award
A nurse was crowned “Nurse Leader of the Year” on 26 October for her work to improve access to care for vulnerable patients in North Yorkshire.
Karen Jordan, of Spectrum Community Health CIC, won the Nurse Leader category at the Nursing Times Awards 2016 for her work as Clinical Team Manager at North Yorkshire Horizons, the integrated drug and alcohol recovery service for North Yorkshire.
As Clinical leader, she developed an outreach nursing model which gave vulnerable patients access to drug and alcohol recovery support at home, in neutral meeting places such as cafés – and even on the street. By going out in the community, nurses were able to engage with patients who might otherwise struggle to attend clinics and gain a wider understanding of issues affecting their recovery. Karen’s team also support patients to attend appointments and regularly liaise with community services (including local authorities, housing associations and the police) to ensure their wellbeing.
NT Awards 2016
Held in London, the Nursing Times Awards are one of the prestigious in the healthcare sector and invite nominations from hundreds of healthcare organisations each year. After winning, Karen said, “I think I’m still in shock! I couldn’t believe it when my name was called – I’m thrilled to have won this award, and so thankful for the fantastic support I’ve received. Supporting patients and understanding their needs is at the heart of what we do in North Yorkshire Horizons, and we know that even the smallest contact made with a vulnerable patient can make a big difference.”
North Yorkshire Horizons, led by DISC services in partnership with Spectrum Community Health CIC and Lifeline, provides integrated drug and alcohol recovery care across a patient area stretching 3,500 square miles. On average, staff handle around 6000 calls per month to their dedicated helpline and have assessed and triaged over 1000 patients in the past 18 months.
In May 2016, Spectrum’s services within North Yorkshire Horizons were inspected by the Care Quality Commission. Inspectors praised the service for treating patients with “compassion, dignity and respect” and said that the service had strong leadership and governance.

Success for National Trans Youth Conference







 
Home » Success for National Trans Youth Conference





								Tuesday 15th November 2016							


DISC Events


A national conference held in Durham on Saturday 12th November was hailed as a great success after more than 80 young people from across the country attended the event.
The conference, promoting positive mental health and wellbeing amongst young people who identify as trans or non-binary,  was organised by DISC in association with the National Trans Youth Network.
Susan Frenk, Principal of St Aidan’s College at Durham where the conference took place, was proud to host such a prestigious event. She said: “We were delighted to host this year’s National Trans Youth Conference. As the Rainbow College, our dream is to help build a world in which the dazzling kaleidoscope of human expression will be as routine as the air that we breathe.
One of the young delegates who attended was full of praise, they said: ” This event was brilliant, it was the first time I have been in a room and felt that I didn’t want to have a panic attack.”
The conference was an opportunity to celebrate the courage and creativity of our friends, students, relatives and icons and promise that we stand with them.”
As well as speakers and activists, the conference also welcomed talks from academics and human rights reformers. A number of workshops were also held that focused on a range of topics including campaigning skills, mental health survival, self-care and managing school.
Those who couldn’t attend in person were still able to follow the days events via social media using #TYC16, helping support the event’s inclusivity.
Paul Townsley, CEO of DISC, was delighted to be associated with such a high profile event. He said: “The work of the gender identity service is vital to the well-being and happiness of hundreds of people living across the North of England. The conference gave young people the chance to express their concerns with real decision makers who can make a difference. These conversations are just the beginning, and we’re all looking forward to making positive changes to the way we work with young people who identify as trans or non-binary.”
Any young person with all issues relating to LGBT, health and well-being are invited to call DISC on 01325 731160 to speak to one of our trained staff for further information.

Straight from the horse’s mouth
by CEO Paul Townsley







 
Home » Straight from the horse’s mouth





								Thursday 24th November 2016							


CEO Blog


Providing the basis for stability
I try to get out and about in my role and meet service users and staff so I can hear what they say – and get it straight from the horse’s mouth.
Since joining DISC, I find these are the most rewarding days. They keep my feet firmly on the ground while allowing me to imagine changes that value our staff and beneficiaries.
I was lucky to spend time with DISC Housing, recently. I spent the day around Darlington and County Durham and got to meet tenants, volunteers and staff.
We provide high standard housing and tenancy support for young people and adults who struggle to maintain housing, often in really difficult circumstances. The vast majority move on to become stable tenants.
Work of the highest value
I was blown away by the stories of our tenants and the commitment and skills of our staff and volunteers. This is not glamorous work, but it is of the highest value to the communities we serve. I was pleased to discover that I would be able to live in all of the DISC Housing places I visited. I was also pleased to see how comfortable and safe they were.
The tenants valued their homes, which provide a bridge to more stable, longer term homes and relationships. We met people who’d previously been homeless, were facing huge changes in their personal life, disability, relationship breakdown. Our housing provided them with a new basis from which to find work, establish social relationships and plan for the future.
Our staff provide a vital role in preventing homelessness and significant deterioration in people’s physical and mental health. They check in to see people and make sure they have everything they want – including light bulbs!
A vital role
I also saw the impact when, occasionally, a tenant leaves or damages our property. We have to deal with fly tipping and houses being trashed. Thankfully, these instances are the exception, not the norm.
If we want to provide ways for people, who have not got the easiest backgrounds, to become paid up members of society, services like ours need to continue and be expanded. It’s unthinkable that this sort of service could be cut.
We plan to keep expanding our offer, having a mixture of owned and private landlord properties and to start to offer housing for these tenants to move into. Our DISC Housing staff work tirelessly and always go the extra mile.
by Paul Townsley,
CEO of DISC

North Yorkshire Horizon Volunteer Success at ‘Oscars’

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


VOLUNTEER SUCCESS AT HARROGATE AWARDS ‘OSCARS’
Two volunteers from North Yorkshire Horizons were celebrating after being voted winners in two categories at the Harrogate & District Volunteering Oscars, held on Friday 28th October at the Old Swan Hotel in Harrogate.
The awards have been running for 10 years and there are an estimated 20,000 people who regularly give time to support a variety of causes across the region. Over 500 guests attended the event and from a significant shortlist, two volunteers from North Yorkshire Horizons walked away with top prizes..
Graham Wood won New Volunteer of the Year, and was presented with his award by Councillor John Fox, who set up the Awards in his Mayoral Year 2009/9. Graham was delighted with his award. He said: “It’s an honour to be chosen as recipient of this award, but it couldn’t have happened without the support and enthusiasm of lots of staff and service users at North Yorkshire Horizons. I look forward to continued success in my new role as a Recovery Co-ordinator at NY Horizons.”
Paul Ivison was presented with the overall title Volunteer of the Year by The Reverend Brian Hunt, Deputy Lieutenant of North Yorkshire. Paul was selected for the award following his efforts to consistently go above and beyond expectations to provide support for a service which is crucial to the community. Paul said: “I’m delighted to be chosen from so many deserving people to be awarded this honour. It means so much to be recognised by peers across the volunteer spectrum. The work we undertake at North Yorkshire Horizons helps people from across the county and I’m looking forward to continuing supporting the service into 2017.”
Ted Haughey, Operations Director, said: “Volunteers provide an invaluable support role to our service users and without them we couldn’t provide the excellent levels of service we do. Graham and Paul are rightly proud of their achievements, and these awards highlight their significant achievements.”
Stephen Flood, Volunteer Coordinator at North Yorkshire Horizons, said “All our volunteers deserve a medal and I’m sure we would nominate all of them if we could! This achievement is really for everyone in recognition for all their effort and hard work across North Yorkshire Horizons.”
The North Yorkshire Horizons Drug and Alcohol Service is a partnership project between DISC, Spectrum, Lifeline and Changing Lives.

GOALs beat Bobbies in Chester-Le-Street Challenge

Members of a County Durham project for people with learning disabilities have scored a success with their local police force in a recent football challenge.
Service users from GOALs (Go Out and Live) played against the local police, including beat officers and police community support officers at Chester-le-Street FC’s multi-use all weather pitch. The GOALs team won 10-6.
Simon Walters, a PCSO based at Pelton, organised the match between GOALs service users and the local policing team. He said: “I’ve been going into the GOALs sessions at Pelton quite a bit and they always go on about football. We play football at work as well and I said can we come along and they were more than happy for us to come along and have a game with them.
“It’s nice to try and do something with everyone in the community, especially sort of groups that sometimes probably get left behind by services. All the Officers here today are based up at Pelton; Special Constables, PCSO’s and a PC as well. It’s been brilliant fun! However, after losing 10-6, we definitely need a rematch!”
GOALs Support Worker, Adrian Geary said: “Today has been fantastic. All the service users have really enjoyed the game. They have been training hard for some time now and it’s been a real joy to watch them display their football skills in a friendly game. We are currently in the process of arranging a rematch with the police for after Christmas as Simon is desperate for revenge.”
David Robson, a service user from GOALs and member of the winning side, said: “I’ve really enjoyed today and it was great to score a goal past the police. I’m now looking forward to a rematch and beat them again!”
Joe Burlison, Chairman of Chester le Street FC, said: “The Club wants to support what they have been doing. We’re happy to support anything of this nature. It is part and parcel of what we do – we’re a charity so if we can help anybody we will do.”

Salford Family Support Project delivers cards for Christmas







 
Home » Salford Family Support Project delivers cards for Christmas





								Tuesday 13th December 2016							


DISC News
Independent living and housing related support


Members of the Salford Family Support project recently participated in a ‘Make & Create’ group to develop some seasonal cards ready for Christmas.
The group, which meets monthly, is made up of service users and their children and is delivered by an ex-service user who now designs and makes cards for a living. She said: “I enjoyed helping people to share my skills in making the cards.”
Members of the group who made the cards were really proud of what they had achieved by the end of the afternoon. One service user said: “I really enjoyed making the cards for my loved ones.” Another service user said “It was much better to make them instead of buying them, it was much more personal.”
The Salford project has plans to continue the ‘Make & Create’ group on a monthly basis, with seasonal themes planned for 2017. If you’re interested in attending, or would like more information on any aspect of the project, please call 0161 793 3637, or visit https://www.disc-vol.org.uk/projects/salford-family-support/

Appeal for Christmas gifts for Scarborough residential service







 
Home » Appeal for Christmas gifts for Scarborough residential service





								Tuesday 13th December 2016							


Independent living and housing related support


Changing Lives, a residential service in Scarborough, has issued a plea for Christmas donations for its service users.
The service is asking for donations for items such as toiletries, warm socks, woolen hats, gloves, DVD’s/CD’s and kitchen utensils, including items that make a house a home, helping to make Christmas special for service users.
Julie Nichol, Service Manager at Changing Lives, said: “We would be incredibly grateful if anyone could donate just a small gift to our service users. They would be making a huge difference, some donations will go to people that will receive only one Christmas Present this year.
Whilst most of us can look forward to a Christmas surrounded by friends and family, with gifts to open and good food to eat, our service users, without your help, may have nothing. We want to make their Christmas with us this year memorable and happy, with presents to open on Christmas Day. We want to be able to give gifts to the 18 people we support so that they too have something to open during the Festive Season.”
Last year, thanks to the generosity of the public, every service user received a Christmas gift, with the residential project enjoying a special day with presents and food for everyone. One service user said he hadn’t had a Christmas present in 40 years and it was “The best Christmas I’ve ever had.”
This year, the service is caring for 18 homeless and vulnerable people who have experienced childhood neglect, abuse and trauma. This includes six people in supported accommodation along with 12 people in floating support. Changing Lives provides access to a wide range of support services that work flexibly to engage and meet the needs of this particularly complex and chaotic client group.
Members of the public can drop items off at Miss Elainey’s, 91 Victoria Road Scarborough, YO11 1SP. The shop is open Monday – Friday, 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. and Saturday’s 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. Donations will be gratefully received up to and including 23/12/16. Donations can also be arranged by calling 01723 861444 for details on where to drop off gifts for the benefit of service users this Christmas.

Successful North Charity DISC to Merge







 
Home » Successful North Charity DISC to Merge





								Wednesday 11th November 2015							


DISC News


DISC, one of the North’s most innovative social care providers, has announced it is to merge with one of its partner organisations, the North Yorkshire based Cambridge Centre.
The two organisations have been in merger talks for the last six months and have worked closely together on North Yorkshire substance misuse services for the past eighteen months.
A further announcement will be made in the next three months on the new organisation’s structure.
Paul Townsley, Chief Executive of DISC said today: “We believe this merger between two well-established, dedicated charities in the North will benefit existing service users and create the potential to help more people. Service users have been at the forefront of our thinking throughout our talks.
“To fully achieve the strategic ambitions of both organisations and whilst in a strong position, it was felt a good time to merge.”
Avril Tully Executive Director for DISC and Nikki Orrell CEO of The Cambridge Centre are leading the transition to merger for both organisations.
Both charities have been working since the mid-1980s to provide services for the vulnerable and disadvantaged in local communities.  DISC currently employs 450 staff from its headquarters in County Durham, and in service provision across the North East, Yorkshire, the Humber and the North West. Services include those for children and young people, LGBT support, housing services, offender rehabilitation and drug and alcohol misuse programmes.
The Cambridge Centre has a twenty nine year history of providing high quality drug, alcohol, women’s and offender services to the community within North Yorkshire.
Nikki Orrell, Chief Executive of The Cambridge Centre, said: “We have shared values and are a good fit for merger. Our approaches to client work are similar and we want to continue to develop and deliver a multi-thematic offer to the communities we serve.
“The Cambridge Centre was founded on the principles of integrity, respect and equality. This chimes exactly with DISC’s ethos.”
She added: “We are delighted to take a really good partnership into a more strategic alliance that allows us to deliver greater social value in North Yorkshire and use the experience and skills of The Cambridge Centre to develop our housing, specialist women’s and offender services.
Paul Townsley said: “DISC is a well-placed Northern provider of social and health care services with the infrastructure and innovative multi-thematic offer to make a merger partnership between the two organisations work.
For DISC working in partnership is a key part of developing services that address our service users’ and communities’ needs.”
Prior to merger, the organisations would be working with funders of the services to make sure their views were fully considered in our strategic planning. They would also be consulting with affected staff to ensure a smooth transfer into the new organisation.

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


Leading North charity  DISC and healthcare specialists St Martin’s Health Care Services announce merger.
Health and social care charity DISC and Leeds-based community interest company St Martin’s Healthcare Services, have announced they will merge in the summer of 2017.
The two organisations have worked together successfully since 2008. They currently work together on major substance misuse services in Leeds and Calderdale and have recently been successful in winning a contract to provide similar services in Barnsley.
They have been considering options for closer partnership working for a year and have decided to complete a merger by June.
Over the next nine months the merged organisation will develop a new vision and strategy in consultation with staff, service users, partners and commissioners.
Paul Townsley, Chief Executive of DISC said today: “St Martin’s Healthcare Services and DISC already work extremely closely together in existing partnerships. We have a very similar ethos and value base.
“This merger means we will form an organisation which has the ability to offer interventions across clinical, health and social care.
“We’ll be able to develop the merged organisation to offer a range of impactful and innovative health and social care services and an integrated model of care.”
Angela Walker, Chief Executive of St Martin’s Healthcare Services, said: “Through close partnership working over a number of years, we have established a great understanding and working relationship.
“This merger allows us to participate in a wider range of activities over a greater geographical area. It will help us to retain and attract good quality staff and offers the merged organisation greater opportunities to work with the NHS.”
About the two organisations
DISC has been working since the mid-1980s to provide services for the vulnerable and disadvantaged in local communities. In the current financial year, it will help over 12,000 people. 
DISC staff are based at its headquarters in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, and in service provision across the North East, Yorkshire, the Humber and the North West. Services include the Moretime Social Enterprise, Housing and Independent Living Support, Health Young People and Families, Employment Training and Education and substance misuse.

This includes substitute prescribing, drug and alcohol detox prescribing, health screening, blood borne virus testing and immunisation and Hep C treatment services.

Generous Scarborough Residents thanked for support at Christmas







 
Home » Generous Scarborough Residents thanked for support at Christmas





								Wednesday 18th January 2017							


DISC News


Changing Lives, a residential service run by the charity DISC, provides intensive support to local people in Scarborough.
In December, the service asked for donations for items such as toiletries, warm socks, woollen hats and DVD’s to help make Christmas special for the service users in Scarborough. The service was overwhelmed by the generosity of local people that meant that service users received at least five wrapped presents each.
Julie Nichol, Service Manager at Changing Lives, said: “On behalf of our service users, I would like to say a huge thankyou to all those people who donated gifts this Christmas. We have been overwhelmed by their generosity that allowed us to make Christmas a little more special for our vulnerable clients.
We’d also like to thank the Scarborough charity SALT for donating £100 of Iceland vouchers that enabled us to provide festive food over Christmas and the New Year. The Scarborough News were also of great help by publishing the appeal, their support was of great help.”
The service cares for 18 homeless and vulnerable people who have experienced childhood neglect, abuse and trauma, including six people in supported accommodation along with 12 people in floating support. Changing Lives provides access to a wide range of support services that work flexibly to engage and meet the needs of this particularly complex and chaotic client group.
The aim of the service is to change the experience of people leading chaotic lives by
halting the cycle of offending, homelessness, substance misuse, anti-social behaviour and self-harm –  all of which put a significant financial strain on local resources i.e. police, ambulance, A&E, especially at this time of year when services can be extremely stretched.
The service is designed to offer shorter term (maximum two years) intensely supported accommodation either under a property management arrangement or in an outreach support setting.
To refer someone who could benefit from the service in Scarborough, please call 01723 861444.

More Time calls for New Year Donations







 
Home » More Time calls for New Year Donations





								Monday 23rd January 2017							


Social Enterprise


The More Time social enterprise has sent out a call for more donations to meet the high demand for second hand goods. The steady stream of customers at the showroom in the DISC headquarters next to the Blue Bridge in Newton Aycliffe means they now need more good quality second-hand goods.
Dawn McCreanor, Manager at More Time, said: “We’re always looking for more furniture, DVDs, books and bric-a-brac as well as white goods and other electrical equipment, all of which are tested on site. These are sold on to local people who may need quality items but prefer not to buy them in the shops.
We’re keen to receive any type of saleable donation that is no longer needed. We offer a free collection service and are happy to travel to collect suitable items.”
All the money raised from the sale of these goods goes back into the More Time service, helping local people develop new skills in retail, sales and cleaning, with the aim of them securing employment in the future.
Opportunities are also available for local people to develop skills in catering within the More Time Café based alongside our furniture showroom.  The café serves hot and cold food available for take away or eating in.
Dawn said “If anyone is struggling with low confidence, this is an excellent place to volunteer to work alongside a great group of people who make you feel really welcome.”
People who would like to donate household goods or are interested in volunteering opportunities are encouraged to telephone 01325 731294.
The More Time Furniture Scheme is open Monday to Saturday between 9am until 4pm.
More Time Furniture Scheme provides good quality second-hand furniture at reasonable prices, enabling local people to source the furniture they need, with a cost effective delivery option for those people who don’t have access to a delivery van.  It also provides fully certified house clearance services for those people who need to have bulky/unwanted items removed from their property.

Adios to a valued friend and colleague
by CEO Paul Townsley







 
Home » Adios to a valued friend and colleague





								Monday 30th January 2017							


CEO Blog


Thank you, Lesley. Adios.
This week, we say adios to our friend and colleague Lesley Cavender. She retires today to live in Spain.
Lesley has been instrumental in the development of DISC into the organisation it is today.
Lesley was on the panel at my job interview.  I had never met her before and was nervous about how we would get on and if I would convince her I was the right person for the job.
At the interview, it was clear what an important role she played at DISC and that she was very smart. I could also see she was service focused and committed to the organisation.
Of all the panel, I felt she had the strongest sense for bullshit! I don’t know whether I impressed her but I did get offered the job. It was really clear that Lesley was somebody I could work with.
For me she has been absolutely pivotal in settling me into my role as CEO. She is excellent at her job and the best confidante and sounding board I have ever worked with. I will always be indebted to her. She does leave a really big gap and will be missed by us all.
Everyone trusts Lesley whether they be a funder, trustee, member of staff or service user. She has been a stabilising force for DISC for many years and made sure we have always moved in the right direction. When thinking through DISC or my approach to issues and choices we face, I have always checked my thinking with Lesley – often modifying and changing my approach as a result.
As a colleague, Lesley always has time for everyone and really cares. It’s really important that our lead on finance understands and drives the ethos and values of the organisation. Lesley has been much more than DISC’s Finance Director. Commercially astute, all our most innovative and viable services owe much to her including our housing and social enterprise offer.
Thankfully, she leaves a strong team ready to take over the reins. She has also kindly agreed to come back on a part time basis to support the transition.
We all have much to be grateful to Lesley for.
When it’s my time to retire, I hope I can go off into the sunset like Lesley and that I will leave anything like the legacy she leaves. We wish her all the best for her new adventure in Spain.
Muchas gracias, amigo.

“An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last.” 
–       Winston Churchill
Churchill’s quote was tweeted by Nadhim Zahawi the Iraqi born Conservative MP for Stratford upon Avon in response to Theresa May’s refusal to criticise Donald Trump’s temporary ban on visitors to the US from Muslim countries.
There are parallels to the UK’s situation and DISC’s – try to stay with me!
Just like the UK wants to control its own sovereignty and borders, we at DISC want to be in control of our own destiny and follow our vision and purpose,
We also recognise that to serve our beneficiaries we need to work in a range of settings with a range of partners.
As Mr Zahawi and Churchill assert, though, there is a time to say no and not work with the crocodile who is using you and will eventually eat you.
At DISC, we are not large enough to deliver everything ourselves. Furthermore, we do not believe that providing services as one large provider serves our communities in the way it needs to. In reality, there are many contracts and services where we need to deliver with other partners who can be our leads.
We will only work with those partners that we feel there is a genuine fit with in terms of values and with whom we can gain mutual benefit for our beneficiaries and organisationally.
Surprisingly (to me, anyway) – as the money becomes tighter, our environment has become more cut-throat and competitive.
As our work in partnership shows, we will not becoming cut-throat and will always work with partners who will help us deliver better services.
Staff and volunteers, may wonder what this has to with what we actually do. Well, it’s important at this stage to hold on to what we are really about. To stand by our principles, as Mr Churchill suggested.
My sister is a teacher and her school is doing a piece of work on Innocent Bystanders. When they see wrong-doing or injustice they do something to stand up against it.
All our staff and volunteers, as well as our partners and commissioners, have made the choice to not be bystanders but to take a stand against injustices and inequalities. I am always impressed with the commitment and honesty I see across our workforce and that when faced with the crocodile we stand up for what’s right.

North Yorkshire Horizons receives first class University report

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


A report highlighting the excellent work delivering adult drug and alcohol treatment and recovery services in North Yorkshire has just been published.
The Public Health Institute, part of Liverpool John Moore University, published the report, entitled “Evaluation of the North Yorkshire Horizons Adult Drug & Alcohol Treatment & Recovery Services”. The report was commissioned by North Yorkshire County Council as part of the tender for the contract in 2014.
Interviews were undertaken with service users, peer mentors and stakeholders over the past two years. Over 40 people took part in the survey, providing in-depth analysis that has helped shape the reports’ findings.
Overall, the stakeholders and service users who were interviewed were positive about the service provided by North Yorkshire Horizons, with the service seen to “facilitate a friendly and supportive atmosphere which helped to promote recovery and challenge the stigma that is associated with addiction.”
Service users enjoyed the different vocational activities and training that was provided and many also discussed how Horizons had helped them access additional support in terms of housing and employment.
The report also found that the services offered are cost-effective for the four substance groups (e.g. opiate, alcohol only, non-opiate & alcohol and non-opiate only), suggesting that investment in adult drug and alcohol services in North Yorkshire is a cost effective use of resources and generates a high return on investment.
Richard Webb, Corporate Director of Health & Adult Services at North Yorkshire County Council has praised the service.
He said: “It’s great to see how far treatment has come in the last two decades and this evaluation is a real credit to everyone within the Public Health Team and North Yorkshire Horizons who have taken forward this work.”

DISC flies the flag for LGBT History Month







 
Home » DISC flies the flag for LGBT History Month





								Tuesday 28th February 2017							


Health & Well-being


Workers at Northern Communities’ charity DISC are completing a busy few weeks promoting LGBT History month.
Billijean Summerbell, Jo Dixon and Rebecca Jackson, pictured with the iconic Rainbow Flag, have been discussing LGBT History at events and group meetings around the North.
Team leader Billijean Summerbell, said: “LGBT History month is about having discussions with people about the struggles Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay and Transgender people have had over the years – and how people have stood up for LGBT rights, often paying the ultimate price.
“We have been able to show how far LGBT rights have come and how difficult the struggle has been over the years, especially in the last century.”
As well as speaking with the charity’s own service users, the team conducted discussions with teachers and lecturers at a special event at the National Glass Centre, in partnership with Sunderland University.
Billijean added: “The talks and groups discussions have been really great. Many people knew about the history but many others did not know how hard it’s been.
“It has been so worthwhile and our young people, who still face discrimination in their everyday lives, have found great strength in it.”
If you would like more information on our LGBT services, please call 01325 731160 or click here

DISC News


More than 40 Leeds residents hoping to build new careers in the construction industry attended a jobs fair as part of the city-wide Step Up Into Construction (SUIC) programme.
The event, at the Leeds Recovery Academy, provided them with the opportunity to speak to a range of organisations about employment and training in the local building trade.
Organisations including design, construction and engineering giant BAM, Swarthmore Education Centre, Reed in Partnership and learndirect attended the event.
Lucy Fella, of Forward Leeds, said, “The event day was a great success. It enabled clients to speak to employers, colleges and other training providers from the construction industry.
We’ve had excellent feedback.”
Hayley Snowden, of Reed in Partnership, said: “It was great to share with members of the community what great work we do to help people get back into work. We received a number of referrals from the afternoon and would encourage other businesses to utilise this opportunity in the future”.
Mike Greener, Careers Practitioner and Team Leader at DISC said “We were delighted by number of local people that attended this event, alongside the enthusiasm of employers and trainers to come along and speak to potential recruits.
As well as providing events like this, we’re involved on a daily basis across Leeds, helping people break into the construction industry. We’re looking to hold more events in 2017 so even more people can benefit from the SUIC programme.”
Forward Leeds and DISC plan to develop future events to promote the Step Up Into Construction programme throughout 2017. For more information on the programme, please visit www.disc-vol.org.uk.
 
The partnership is made up of a group of Leeds based delivery partners that include:
Aspire-Igen
Bradford College
Calderdale College
CHY
Groundwork
Kirklees College
Leeds City College (Keighley Campus)
Leeds College of Building

Collective Voice
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services



Joint work between Collective Voice, the NHS and PHE to improve clinical responses to drug-related deaths

Collective Voice believes that the most significant challenge facing the drug treatment and recovery system today is responding to the health needs of an ageing and increasingly vulnerable population. Moreover, that response must be formed in the context of declining resources and a fragmented delivery landscape.DISC is a member of Collective Voice. Please see full story on the Collective Voice website here.

DISC wins Community Hearts at awards ceremony

Employment, Training and Education


A councillor has praised DISC after it won a prestigious award proving it was at the “Heart of the Community”
Durham County Councillor John Clare was one of the judges at Aycliffe Business Park’s “Make Your Mark” awards at which DISC won the Heart of the Community Category.
Councillor Clare, a former teacher at Greenfield School in the town, said: “As one of the judges, I was impressed by the depth and the sheer scale of the work DISC is doing with young people.
“And perhaps the most impressive thing of all was Lindsey Smith’s acceptance speech, in which her commitment and care were clear for all to see.
“I was proud to have taught such a caring person, and the young people are lucky to have such an advocate.”
The award celebrates excellence in corporate, social and ethical activity.
Lindsey Smith, Senior Team Leader, said: “It was a very proud moment when the award was announced. This was the first year we have entered the Make Your Mark awards, and to be shortlisted alongside some much larger organisations was an achievement in itself; to win was simply outstanding!
“The award is recognition of the hard work that the whole of the Education Services team do on a day to day basis, something that we are all very proud of and it’s fantastic to have this recognised by the local business community.”
Paul Townsley said: “Achieving the Heart of the Community Award is another affirmation of the excellent work undertaken by DISC and I congratulate everyone in the Education Services team.
“We’re currently speaking to several local businesses about how they can help us develop more work experience positions for our students, and we’d love to hear from any Ayclifffe business that may be interested in helping.”

Bringing the Outsider in – by Emma Crawford Moore

Health and Young People Manager’s blog – by Emma Crawford Moore.
The Challenging Youth Racism team and I were invited to deliver a ‘Bringing the Outside in’ session to Big Lottery staff on Thursday 23rd March. This provided us with an opportunity to showcase the fantastic work the project has completed since it started in July 2016; whilst also allowing the team there to gain a better understanding of the impact of the funding they work so hard to grant and manage on a day to day basis.
We were invited to lunch before the presentation with our funding officer for the project Deanne Dixon as well as our other funding officer Bryan Scott who oversees both Horizon Young Adult Carers and BRiCWorks. Julie Coxon who tirelessly supported the development of our initial application form and Peter Foggo who organises the events were also in attendance. This relaxed lunch provided a brilliant forum for discussing our projects and their impacts without the ‘fear factor’ which can sometimes be associated with meeting our funders or commissioners.
The presentation which was delivered by Lee-Ann Gittins, Kelly McClay and I was well received and the team were impressed with our first year outcomes to date of:

Universal Awareness Sessions delivered to 1534 young people against a target of 500
Targeted Awareness Sessions delivered to 315 young people against a target of 500
Peer Mentor Training completed with 11 young people and commenced with a further 26 young people. A further 24 are due to commence totalling 61 against a target of 40.
Engaged with 4 BME groups through indirect pathways such as council links against a target of 5

I am immensely proud of the achievements of the team in such a short space of time and this provided a fantastic opportunity to share this with our funders in a much more interactive way than the annual report.  Peter emailed following the presentation to say “I wanted to say a massive thanks to you, Kelly and Lee-Ann for yesterday’s presentation. From speaking to a number of people who were there it was really well received and it was so poignant after what had happened in London the day before.”
 If any of you are invited to ‘bring the outside in’ please accept, as it was as positive an experience for us as it was for the 30 Big Lottery staff who attended.
Emma Crawford Moore 
Manager – Health, Young People and Families Unit

DISC works on Action Towards Inclusion

								Tuesday 20th December 2016							


DISC News
Employment, Training and Education


DISC has joined a partnership of 61 organisations from across York, North Yorkshire and East Riding LEP that will deliver an innovative work, training and volunteering programme for those people furthest away from work and training.
The three year project is funded by the Big Lottery Fund and the European Social Fund and is managed by Your Consortium based in Knaresborough.  The work on the ground will be undertaken by key workers and specialist intervention partners through a range of organisations in the voluntary and community sector.
This project is one of the largest funding streams secured for a voluntary and community sector partnership in the area.  It represents an exciting opportunity for local charities and voluntary organisations within the partnership to demonstrate their effectiveness in supporting those most distant from work, training and volunteering – offering flexible support to help adults overcome physical, psychological, financial and skills-related barriers and progress towards employment, training, education and job-search, whilst at the same time helping to combat a range of social issues including poverty and social exclusion.
DISC is one of the partnership organisations that will be working on Action Towards Inclusion, offering key worker support.  They will be based in Scarborough, Selby and Harrogate and will work with residents from across these locations.
Liane Taylor is Operations Director at DISC. She said: “We are really excited to be part of this partnership project that enables local organisations to join together and use their knowledge and experience to improve prospects for people who, for various reason, are not in training or employment. The contract award represents a real investment in the area and potential for local charities to make a real difference to local people.”
Building Better Opportunities

The Big Lottery Fund is the largest funder of community activity in the UK. It puts people in the lead to improve their lives and communities, often through small, local projects.
It is responsible for giving out 40% of the money raised by National Lottery players for good causes. Every year it invests over £650 million and awards around 12,000 grants across the UK for health, education, environment and charitable purposes.
Since June 2004 it has awarded over £9 billion to projects that change the lives of millions of people.
The project has received up to £7.4m of funding from the Big Lottery Fund and the European Social Fund as part of the 2014-2020 European Structural and Investment Funds Growth Programme in England. The Department for Work and Pensions is the Managing Authority for the England European Social Fund programme. Established by the European Union, the European Social Fund helps local areas stimulate their economic development by investing in projects which will support skills development, employment and job creation, social inclusion and local community regenerations. For more information visit gov.uk/european-growth-funding
Your Consortium is an enterprise based in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire that develops partnerships within the community and voluntary sector and manages delivery of a range of programmes funded by National Government, The Big Lottery Fund, Local Authorities and National Charites. It’s has an active partnership base across the York, North and West Yorkshire and East Riding area.

MORE TIME FOR CAKE AS DISC SUPPORTS MACMILLAN COFFEE MORNING
DISC Staff donated and sold cakes and coffee to raise £250 for MacMillan Cancer.
Workers delivered a table full of cakes to the building’s More Time Café where they were then sold in aid of the Macmillan Cancer Coffee Morning, whilst students from DISC’s Steps 4 Success programme did their bit by collecting money, manning the tombola and decorating the café to help entice customers into making a purchase.
DISC finance officer Siobhan Dalton from Durham said: “There were so many cakes on offer I didn’t know which one to choose. In the end, I went for a fairy cake, which was delicious!”
Craig Westwood, also from DISC, said “Even though I’ve been on a diet recently, these cakes and the good cause their sale helps meant that for one day only, I can indulge. The lemon drizzle cake has gone down a storm!”
Julie Nisbet, Business Manager at More Time, said: “This is our second year raising money for MacMillan. They do marvellous work  and they’re close to the hearts of many of our staff members. Of course, our staff are very charitable and we were proud to make so much money in the coffee morning.”
“We were really pleased with the amount of support from staff and the community. S4S and the café team worked extremely hard and were paramount to the success of the event.”

A new £5,000 NHS-funded project at the BRICWorks health and wellbeing community hub in Hull is targeting lonely people in the city.
Wayne Dobson of BRICWorks said over thirty thousand people over the age of 65 live alone; this new project aims to help some of these people reduce their isolation.
Wayne Dobson, of BRICWorks, said: “Following an impassioned presentation to Hull’s NHS Clinical Commissioning Group that emphasised the way we could help local people who are at risk of becoming isolated in their own community, we were pleased to win their support, and we’re delighted that we’ve been able to launch Recall Mondays.”
“There are tens of thousands of people in Hull who are isolated – including over 30,000 over 65s who live alone. This new project aims to help some of those people reduce their feelings of isolation.”
People who attend are provided with a hot meal that can be shared at a table in the company of others. They are encouraged to recall memories with the aim of engendering a shared sense of community.
They are able to play games including prize bingo as well as take part in creative activities based on film, dance and music.
Mr Dobson said the sessions, at the Big Lottery-funded BRICWorks centre in Story Street, Hull, each Monday from 10am to 4pm aim to improve the health of individuals, and reconnect them with their local community.
 
Staff at the project also liaise with local health and social agencies to become involved to allow older people access to services they may otherwise miss out on.

David Lawson RAPt DISC partnership
DISC has launched a new partnership with RAPt (the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust) to offer services for people in Hull who are in recovery from addiction.
The partnership, based at Bricworks community centre in Story Street, Hull, brings a new post which will provide activities tailored to support people in recovery from addiction to maintain their recovery and learn new skills to help them build lives away from addiction and the crime so often associated with drug use.
Paul Townsley, Chief Executive at DISC, said: “We’re delighted to be working with RAPt on this partnership. Bricworks provides much needed activities and support for people in recovery from drug and alcohol issues.
“This partnership will allow us to offer increased support to those people from across Hull who need help in their drive to beat addiction.”
Douglas Dunsmore Dawson, RAPt Regional Manager said: “RAPt is excited to launch this new partnership that builds on the suite of services we already offer to people in Hull.
“Often our clients report feelings of isolation as they leave a life of addiction behind them. This project aims to create a space where they can interact with a community to build their lives away from addiction”
RAPt  works to help people with drug and alcohol dependence, both in prison and in the community, overcome the grip of addiction and lead positive lives, free from drugs and crime.

Alison Barrie Vlog February 2017
Leeds Offender Support Services
transcription (video has subtitles)
“One of the things we’re really proud of that is the ultimate statistic of over 75 per cent don’t go back into custody.
“One of the key things that we’re proud of is that partnership work that we do within the offender management programme and key partners include probation, police, prison, courts, the treatment service Forward Leeds and social  care amongst a number of other support services in Leeds. One of the key things in the partnership work is communications.
“So there are the tasking meetings, where we look at individuals that are coming through police custody being released from prison and we set up immediate action plans for vulnerable people ,  high risk offenders. again looking at the whole key aim and ambition of reducing offending and making neighbourhoods and people’s residences more safe.
“So our key operation at the moment is reducing burglaries in Leeds.
“And tying back to partnership work, it is that talking, communicating and building a jigsaw up about individuals so we’ve  built up really good, effective, meaningful working relationships with the  key partners, not just in criminal justice and it’s all about building the jigsaw up so that at the time we actually meet the service user, we’ve actually got a good, clear picture of where we think we could be helpful and supportive for that individual to maybe attend and  engage with and hopefully, that makes it easier for the service user to trust us and build rapport with the case manager.”

A diverse workforce geared up to work with the diverse needs of service users.
By Leeds DIP IOM Project Manager, Alison Barrie.
What I’m really proud of is the diverse team that we have. The team includes paid staff, volunteers and peer mentors. Some are university graduates perhaps with psychology degrees. Some have had their own recovery journeys. Some have been involved in the criminal justice system themselves – so we have a really diverse workforce that are able to support our service users.
One of the things that I’m most proud of is how close the team are in the Leeds DIP IOM service and just the team spirit that keeps them going through quite challenging work. They work with individuals with multiple, complex needs and vulnerabilities and I guess having a workforce that’s so diverse and with different qualifications and certificates, different backgrounds means that there is a really good support system for service users at different points in the criminal justice system.
Getting past the revolving door
Some of the service users we work with have been around the criminal justice system, time and time again, they are desperate to break the cycle and find something that works. One of the biggest challenges we have is in breaking down the barriers and getting to know that person as an individual and building that rapport.
As human beings we act differently and connect differently with different people and as a worker it’s sometimes good to have a choice and to find the natural link into what motivates a person to change. Sometimes a worker can be coming from a recovery journey themselves and can link in and work differently and at different stages to a person who has maybe been trained to deliver certain interventions. But both are just as valuable and accessible in this DISC service.
We’re really proud that over 75% of the people we work with do not end up back in custody during the time that we’re Reduced re-offendingworking with them and we feel that’s a great reflection of the work that the DISC team is providing to the service users in that people are not going back into prison while they’re receiving support from the DISC team.
Service users can be with us for anything up to two years and sometimes as short as three to four weeks depending on their person need – a good average is for us to work with service users for four to six months.
We ask for feedback during and at the end of our work with individuals so we can look at if we need to change anything. Consistently, we get positive feedback about individual case managers and we’ve got lots of good examples where individuals have fed back and valued the support that their case manager has given them. I think that’s a credit to the DISC team and goes back to the diversity of the workforce and how we utilise that diversity. We try to match people to the correct worker at the correct time.
Service user involvement meetings
Part and parcel of this approach is service user involvement. We’re very keen that the service users have a voice – and actively are involved in influencing any service change and service development. We’ve established our service user group here at Mabgate and we have a once a month meeting that’s a forum for service users to be able to feedback and look at improvements. We collect service users comments – positive and not so positive – and also encourage their input to plan activities. We know that filling time satisfyingly and socialisation can be the key to somebody’s keeping on the right road. To try to prevent re-offending, we have continued with fishing and football activities and we’re hoping to continue to grow a timetable of activities that we’ve got on offer.

Volunteering


Faster than a stolen pen
by Volunteer Development Manager Ann Hall
My focus for 2017/8 is all about training and development for our volunteer workforce.
It’s a key part of the strategy for DISC over the next couple of years to ensure that volunteers are able to develop the skills and competencies that they need and want.
At DISC we recognise that our workforce is its most valuable asset and that workforce is made up of a large number of volunteers. We want to ensure we have a strong training and development plans for individual volunteers based on their own needs and career pathways
This week I had a great example of how we can be very responsive to their needs.
One of our volunteers had gone for a job interview with one of our partners. I asked him how he had done and he replied that he felt he had, “smashed it” apart from one question around safeguarding.
I knew we had a safeguarding course running that week and while he waited I phoned the training department and got him added on to the course. Job done another satisfied customer.
I then lent the volunteer my pen to write down the details of the training and the cheeky so and so stole my pen, adding, “maybe, I shouldn’t bite the hand that feeds me.”
We always try to help all our volunteers with development requirements and it’s great that we were able to sort this volunteer’s need out there and then. Even if it did cost me my pen!

DISC retains its key worker service in Salford

								Friday 17th March 2017

Manager blog by Cathy Unsworth,
DISC has been successful in retaining the contract for the new key worker service in Salford.
Since finding out in December that we retained the contract, work has been ongoing to ensure that the new service is set up to enable us to achieve the targets and outputs indicated in the contract.
Whilst delighted that the contract was retained, much of my time since has been devising and implementing the transition plan.
Not only does the contract contain some new challenges but there are also challenges around changes which are taking place in the city around the delivery of support services as a whole.  This is in addition to developing a locality delivery model with an asset based approach.
My approach has to be a sensitive one when other roles may not continue in other services but at the same time ensuring that DISC are in the best position possible to deliver a continuing high quality, valued and professional service and this has been a difficult balance to maintain.
I am reassured by the strong and supportive team I have around me.  Workers who are resilient, supportive and maintain their eagerness despite changes and challenges.
We have continued to deliver our high quality service and have offered our service users the opportunity to attend activities – including our Make and Create Group and a trip to Cheshire Workshops during this time.
I would not want to end this blog without acknowledging some of the key players in our success, which include:
The Salford staff team, Sophie Fox and her team, Sara Allen, Andrew Kennedy, My colleagues in the management team… And last but not least Helen Bowyer our Assistant Director.
A real team effort which has brought success!!
Salford Staff have also attended a recent event delivered by Salford University (Making Research Count)

Barnsley Recovery Steps goes live

								Saturday 01st April 2017							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


People across Barnsley who are affected by drug and alcohol misuse can seek support through a new service which launches on 1st April 2017.
DISC has recently been commissioned by Barnsley Council to provide Substance Misuse Service aimed at prevention and recovery from drug and alcohol misuse, with a greater focus on reducing the harm caused to families and the local community.
The service, named ‘Barnsley Recovery Steps’, will provide an innovative approach to the treatment of drug and alcohol addiction with a tailored programme to help people to overcome their addictions. Group work, one to one intervention, mutual aid and innovative peer led support will form the basis of the service.  The programme will support those who have previously failed recovery, making sure people are given every chance to become drug and alcohol free.
Barnsley Recovery Steps will offer a fast-track approach to recovery which will include detox at the earliest possible stage. Partnership working with Northern College will also give people in recovery the opportunity to take part in volunteer and apprentice programmes.
Emily Todd, DISC’s Assistant Director for Service Development Substance Misuse, said “Delivery of outstanding services that are embedded in communities is at the heart of what we do.  We’re looking forward to working with Barnsley Council, with stakeholders and partners, and most importantly with the people that use our services, to deliver an innovative and person centred service. DISC has experience in delivering peer led recovery models, where people support each other to achieve their goals, and alongside a range of other interventions, these will enable us to deliver a first class service for the people of Barnsley.
“Service user and stakeholder involvement is at the heart of what we do, and we will be looking to consult and meet with as many people as possible over the coming weeks and months, to further shape and develop our service offer to meet the needs of local people, families and communities.”
Cllr Jenny Platts, Cabinet Spokesperson for Communities, said: “We’re committed to supporting people and their families/carers, to live their lives free from alcohol and drugs. We’re pleased to be working alongside DISC to make sure that people get the right support at the right time in order to overcome their drug and alcohol issues.
“It’s important to stress we’ll continue to work with partners and current providers during this period to make sure we can offer good quality support services for the people who need it.”
 
To contact Barnsley Recovery Steps please call 01226 779066 or visit www.disc-vol.org.uk/projects/barnsley for more information.

A Safe Environment at The Greens

Independent living and housing related support
Service Blogs


The Greens blog
DISC Independent Living
by Marie Dodds, Project leader

The Greens is a supported accommodation service for up to 21 adults with Alcohol and/or substance misuse issues who either live in Sheffield or who have a Sheffield connection.
We are a 24 hour staffed service, which means we have staff on duty all the time, This means that we can be there whenever our service users need us to be, but it also means we can engage in more informal leisure activities with the group such as playing bingo and doing quizzes and barbequing in summer.
Random drink and drug testing
We are an abstinence based service which means that all our service users can live in a safe, alcohol and drug free environment.  We operate frequent, random Alcohol and Drug testing which ensures that our service users feel secure in the knowledge that they are not going to be tempted to drink or use drugs.
We offer key working sessions to all our clients on a regular basis but are available for clients at any other time too.  We also have a group work programme which is meant to help people get routine and stability back in their lives and prepare them for future employment, training or volunteering.
Getting involved in the community
Our groups are run on a regular basis, mostly in the mornings so service users have the rest of the day free to do other things such as volunteering and attending local courses as well as leisure activities.  The staff encourage all our service users to plan and get involved in outside community events as much as possible as this is an excellent way of reintegrating with day to day life.
At the Greens, we have 16 rooms in the main house. All our rooms come fully equipped with furniture and bedding, and all the rooms are en suite which means people don’t have to share facilities.  There is a shared lounge, kitchen, laundry and large garden, and we have a rota for maintaining and keeping the public areas clean.
Self contained flats
We also have five self contained flats. These are useful for people who are further on in their recovery and who will benefit from a further period of support before they leave to move into their own tenancy.  The flats are separate from the main house and have their own secure entrance, each flat has a living room with attached kitchen, and a separate bedroom and bathroom.
Initial assessment
When someone is referred to The Greens, we do an initial assessment preferably at the project so the client can look around and meet some of the other service users.  Once the assessment has been done we will have a panel meeting and then contact both the referrer and the client to offer them a place if they are suitable.  Provided the person is at least 5 days sober and a place is available they could potentially move into the Greens very quickly.  This may take longer if they need to have a detox or we are full and they need to wait for a bed to become free.
The main bulk of the rent is paid by Housing Benefit, however there are ineligible charges for things such as utilities which necessitate a small rent contribution to be paid by the service users.  Service Users are also responsible for buying their own food and clothing etc and for paying their own TV Licences.
When clients are getting to the stage of thinking about moving on they are given support from the staff to apply for suitable housing, and are supported up till the time they leave and move into their own property.
Marie gets enormous satisfaction in being part of people’s recovery journey
Marie Dodds,
18 April 2016

Volunteering


Volunteering blog by Ann Hall,
April 24th, 2017,
This year’s Volunteers Week is fast approaching, with just 40 days and 40 nights left to prepare. Volunteers Week is an annual campaign run by the NCVO* to thank and celebrate volunteers across the UK.  2017’s Volunteers Week campaign is titled, ‘you make the difference’.
I want to use this week as a chance to celebrate the huge contribution our volunteers make to our services across the North of England by running our own DISC Volunteers Day.
In previous years we have held small local events but this year, for the first time, I will try and bring together as many of our volunteers as possible to say “thank you” from DISC. This will also give them the opportunity to meet other people doing equally great work in related areas. So, we will be bringing our volunteer workforce, under one roof.
At present DISC have almost 80 registered volunteers, with over 50 of those based across Leeds so guess where we will be holding the event …… somewhere up North! To narrow your guess down a little the venue sits in ‘The Best Place in Britain to Live’** and if that doesn’t help then the map coordinates are latitude 53.803325 and longitude, -1.566238. Are we there yet? If not, the answer is LEEDS. The
Recovery Academy will be opening its doors to Volunteers Week and have kindly agreed to let me take over the building (for a couple of hours).
The event will be taking place on Friday 2nd June 10am – 12noon and is open to every DISC Volunteer, Volunteer Lead, Volunteer Coordinator and Volunteer Supervisors. If you haven’t received your invitation yet, you soon will so look out for an email from Mollie. Mollie is a student at Leeds Beckett University studying Entertainment Management. Mollie has signed up as a volunteer with DISC to gain experience of events planning to complement her course. Mollie and I will be very busy over the next few weeks ensuring everything is in place in order for DISC to be able to show our appreciation to all Volunteers who this year have given  13,824 hours of their time.
We will also be taking part in the #ivolunteer Twitter campaign during Volunteers Week, Mollie and I will be contacting all DISC volunteers asking if they want to be involved by sending in a photo of themselves, with the #ivolunteer banner.
I hope to see many volunteers at the event and I can guarantee there will be cake.
*NCVO champions the voluntary sector and volunteering because they’re essential for a better society. They do this by connecting, representing and supporting voluntary organisations.
** as identified by the Henley Management Colleges ‘Urban Behaviours’ study.

Local social landlord DISC Housing is aiming to help tenants spruce up their gardens, back yards and their local community spaces this summer by sowing flower seeds.
The Newton Aycliffe-based Registered Social Landlord successfully applied for garden packs to Big Lottery funded Grow Wild, the UK’s biggest-ever wild flower campaign, which aims to  bring people together to transform local spaces with native, pollinator-friendly wild flowers and plants. 
Sam Palmer of DISC Housing, said: “We’re thrilled to have got the packs from Grow Wild.
“They’ve donated a wide variety of garden seeds which we are planning to work with our tenants to encourage them to brighten up their gardens, back yards other relevant spaces by helping them to plant these seeds and improve their homes and the areas in which they live”

April blog by Team Leader, Billijean Summerbell
I transferred over to DISC around 9 years ago after working at a young people’s service in the centre of Durham called End House a fantastic resource for young people which provided everything from counselling to sexual health advice and support. My main responsibly was working with young Gay men around HIV prevention this involved running social groups and providing 1 to 1 support.
In total I have worked in the field of LGB and T for over 12 years in that time I have built up some great relationships with service users and professionals I have also seen a lot change over the years in relation to acceptance.
When I was transferred over to DISC, I was really nervous about how I would be supported in my specialist line of work. I had – and still have – real passion for my work and I needed someone to help me to develop my thoughts and ideas.
It turned out, I was to work under a brilliant manager who understood the work I was delivering – and that really helped. I can say that DISC has really embraced the LGBT service and our charity has enab led me to develop the service into what it is today.
It was tough when I came out 20 years ago – and it still is!
We have grown from delivering group and 1 to 1 support in Durham to working across the North East.
I came out when I was around 20 years old in a mining village just out of Durham and it is still as hard now for young people to come out as when it was then. I suffered from really bad depression and Anxiety thinking about how the world and how I would be accepted. No internet, no support at all in School or Durham the only thing I had in relation to not feeling alone was for those who remember a couple of Gay Characters in the soaps Beth and Margaret Brookside which at its time caused a bit of a stir with that famous kiss on the door step 22 years ago how times have past. Still in 2017 in my opinion things are better however not perfect still LGB and T people live in  the city’s to feel a sense of safety and acceptance  I have seen Durham City move on slightly with having its first Pride in 2015 which was great for the community and its villages surrounding. That’s however this is one day we need places to be accepting 24/7 people to be able to be themselves school, work, uni, community accessing services,  that’s my dream.
Lucky for me I come from a big family who have always been supportive and would protect me know matter what. Some young people who we work with have no form of support and can sometimes end up on the streets and in really desperate situations.
It’s certainly not all doom and gloom, being LGB or T and our service works on building resilience and confidence with the young people and their families.
We run peer support groups every week ,Deliver Family work ,one to one support ,Educate professional, Activity’s and sessions in Schools. Ran conferences, photography projects ,swimming, sailing, canoeing, horse riding, art campaigning, sexual health… the young people we work with are amazing.

It has been a busy few months for DISC Housing. We have increased the number of properties we have to over 200 units across the North of England.
This will enable more DISC service users the opportunity to gain accommodation they would otherwise have struggled to secure.  DISC Housing’s staff team has also increased to meet the additional demands the increased housing stock brings.
Fiona Patrick has been appointed as Team Leader.  She has vast experience and knowledge gained within the housing industry and will oversee housing staff and focus on business development opportunities.
Simon Frost has been appointed as Repairs and Maintenance Operative for the North East.  Simon will undertake work in our County Durham and Darlington properties.  This will improve the service we deliver to our tenants and provide a more efficient and effective service.
Finally Charlotte Morris, has been appointed as Housing Assistant and will support the Housing Officer in Bradford.
DISC Housing have been appointed as a Preferred Provider with the Homes & Communities Agency. This is a significant achievement and will enable us to apply for additional funding which will help us to achieve further growth in the future.
DISC Housing tenants have also been busy, helping us to review our policies and procedures and getting involved in other DISC Housing activities.  This includes meeting members of the DISC Board and Paul Townsley the DISC Chief Executive, where tenants had the opportunity to find out more about their roles within DISC and offer ideas and recommendations on the services they would like to see DISC Housing deliver in the future.
I am sure that the next 6 months will be equally as busy.

Fantastic outcomes for Young Carers







 
Home » Fantastic outcomes for Young Carers





								Tuesday 02nd May 2017							


Service Blogs


Horizon Young Adult Carers’ Service have been extremely fortunate to have been invited to attend three NHS England residential experiences in the last year to train and develop the young adult carers as NHS Health Champions, writes Emma Crawford-Moore.
The residential events have provided the young people with a huge array of experiences and opportunities they would not usually have the chance to participate in, whilst providing respite from their caring role.
I was very lucky to be able to attend the final residential in London with Jamie and Luke, our NHS Health Champions. The experience demonstrated the fantastic outcomes being achieved through this process from the train journey where Jamie and Luke were filming the journey to form part of a vlog they have been completing to record the experience: Through to a visit with David Mowat Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Health, to provide a platform for the young adult carers to share their views, thoughts and opinions regarding what needs to change for Young Adult Carers within the next national strategy.
It was brilliant to see the personal transitions of all of the Young Adult Carers who have attended from across the UK who have been supported throughout to try new experiences and challenge themselves. We undertook a presentation skills workshop whilst we were there and it was inspiring to see young people really ‘putting themselves out there’, I certainly learnt some new skills. As a result of all of their hard work and enthusiasm Jamie and Luke have been asked to act as peer mentors for next year’s round of events which demonstrates the impact of their learning and development.
We’re now looking forward to the next event for the 2018 NHS Young Adult Carers Champions round starting in July.

Manager – Health, Young People and Families Unit

National platform for Young Adult Carers

								Tuesday 02nd May 2017							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


DISC’s Horizon Young Adult Carers service has been involved with the NHS Health Champions Campaign delivered by NHS Carers Leads.
This involvement has allowed young adult carers the opportunity to share their views, thoughts and opinions about their roles as young adult carers.
The young carers have also expressed their views on how services could be improved to support the identification and support of young adult carers. The opportunity has provided a national platform to share their stories and experiences.
DISC manager, Emma Crawford Moore said: “The NHS campaign has enabled local issues to be shared on a national platform. We will also receive access to films, animations and resources to assist in the delivery and capacity building within our own project. ”
As part of the last residential the Young Carers met with David Mowat Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Health who is currently writing the national carers strategy.

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services
Service Blogs


North Yorkshire Horizons, Selby blog by Mark Vidgen
DISC Drug and Alcohol Services
It is often the case that people from minority ethnic groups feel treatment services don’t meet their needs, or are not culturally appropriate for them.
In addition, literature suggests that awareness among BME communities of the services available to them, and how they can help, can be limited.
There is a need for clearer, better targeted information to help these groups access drug and alcohol treatment services and fully understand the impact of drugs and alcohol on their communities.
Having staff and volunteers who are competent in diversity and cultural sensitivity, with access to interpreters or advocates trained in substance misuse can also make a difference.
The type of substances used varies amongst different ethnic groups. For example, evidence has found that, when compared to the general treatment population, some service users from minority groups are less likely to use heroin, but are more likely to use crack as their primary drug. In turn, it is crucial that local service provision matches local need.
As opposed to the English drinking culture of going out to drink, the Polish community are far more likely to stay at home and consume alcohol in private homes. This trend seems to stem from a willingness to stay within a communal group in which there are no language or culture clashes.
For many of the Poles who have emigrated to Selby, this type of social situation is far cheaper to attend or host and is therefore more appealing than going out. The point at which this lifestyle seems to advocate alcoholism, however, is when drinking in the home environment is seen as an acceptable pastime.
North Yorkshire Horizons Selby are striving to break down these perceived cultural barriers. A, a Polish National wanted to give something back after completing treatment and joining the Selby team as a volunteer.
He is now “spreading the word” within his Polish community, advocating for North Yorkshire Horizons and breaking the perceived barriers amongst his peers. A  is attending Polish churches, developing and delivering service user led recovery focused enterprises, developing and delivering peer mentoring and support.
The growth of volunteering and service user involvement in the design and delivery of the service has made a large contribution to North Yorkshire Horizons, ensuring we are user-friendly and resulting in significant positive change for the people, like AA, who would like to engage but culturally not sure how to!

Young Carers’ Service Celebrates Funding Extension







 
Home » Young Carers’ Service Celebrates Funding Extension





								Tuesday 02nd May 2017							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


DISC’s Darlington Young Carers’ Service is celebrating after securing extended funding from Darlington Borough Council.
The service provides one to one support for Young Carers and Young Adult Carers up to the age of 25, who help look after a relative who has a condition, such as a disability, illness, mental health condition, or a drug or alcohol problem. Since beginning in September 2013, the service has supported 351 Young Carers to date, providing one to one support, activities, information, advice and guidance.
Emma Crawford-Moore, Manager at DISC, said: “We’re delighted to have been secured this new funding to allow us to continue to deliver this much needed and valued service for Young Carers and their families.
“As well as supporting the Young Carers in their home, we also work with Darlington Schools to award the Young Carers Schools Charter award which identifies and supports individuals within schools.
We’re currently working with a number of schools in Darlington and we’re always keen to hear from more local schools who would like to work towards the Charter to support their pupils.”
Darlington Young Carers is based at Enterprise House in Darlington.

﻿DISC’s Systemic Family Therapy Approach







 
Home » ﻿DISC’s Systemic Family Therapy Approach





								Monday 15th May 2017							


Service Blogs


by Debbie Young
Platform Gateshead
When working with young people, a family approach is often used in order to improve communication within the family unit. DISC have developed their own family approach  (DSFT) and provide training to their staff in order to develop skills.
This approach was used recently when trying to encourage a young person to attend the service after being referred by A&E. After being offered two appointments, the young person reluctantly attended the Platform office with their parents. By using this approach the young person was able to demonstrate to their parents that they were willing to make certain lifestyle changes. Once the young person was reassured that we were not judgemental and there to provide education and information to enable them to make more informed choices in the future and keep themselves safe, they relaxed and seemed more than happy to start engaging with us.
During the assessment process, parents stated they felt reassured as they now fully understand what interventions we will be offering to their child. As sessions progress, the parents will be able to support their child and be involved in their progress which will hopefully help to alleviate any worries they may have regarding their child’s substance misuse.
This approach helps to open up the lines of communication within the family in a group setting in a safe environment and allows the young person to have a voice. Hopefully this will result in them being able to work together .

Ground breaking programme to stop overdose deaths







 
Home » Ground breaking programme to stop overdose deaths





								Thursday 11th May 2017							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


In an innovative new policy Forward Leeds, the drug and alcohol service for Leeds has been distributing potentially lifesaving kits to clients. The kits contain Naloxone an opiate receptor blocker along with instructions for use.
Naloxone can temporarily reverse the effect of opiates such as heroin. It binds with the opioid receptors and removes the opioids from these receptors. This has the effect of quickly bringing someone round in the event of an overdose and saving their life.
Senior management at the service say they are pleased to be able to roll out this important programme across Leeds for the first time and make the kits available to everyone who needs one.
Lee Wilson, Area Manager for Forward Leeds said: “We have been distributing Naloxone kits to clients since the beginning of March this year. Most opioid overdoses are witnessed by friends, partners or family members. There is often someone on hand who could have administered Naloxone and prevented a death if the kit was there and they knew how to use it.
“They are being distributed by our Recovery Coordinators and by staff at harm reduction services across Leeds. We have already had three used packs returned for replacement. Potentially that’s three lives saved. That’s someone’s son or daughter, brother or sister, father or mother who is alive because of the kits we are distributing. They are life savers.”
Dr Ian Cameron, Leeds City Council’s Director of Public Health, said: “We have funded this programme based on the public health benefits and the potential to save lives.
Dr Cameron continued: ”We take our responsibility to do what we can to prevent unnecessary deaths seriously and this investment will support the wide range of work we are doing to save lives, reduce the health harms of drug misuse and support those needing help to deal with dependency.”
Forward Leeds supports adults and young people to make healthy choices about alcohol and drugs. They reduce risk-taking behaviours through dedicated prevention, early intervention and tailored programmes. Their experts support people to achieve and sustain recovery.
Forward Leeds was commissioned by Leeds City Council and three Leeds Clinical Commissioning Groups.

Platform Outreach Project pilot ends sucessfully







 
Home » Platform Outreach Project pilot ends sucessfully





								Monday 15th May 2017							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families
HYPF blogs


A three month pilot project entitled POP,  which was developed by DISC’s project Platform Gateshead has now been completed.
The Platform Outreach Project was developed as a way to begin to explore how to address substance misuse, antisocial behaviour and risk taking behaviour amongst young people in identified hotspot areas across the borough.
Project leader Faye Codling said: “We believe this project brings significant benefits to young people and the local community and would like to be reconsidered for further funding to continue this work over the next 12 months.
“Within this, we would also like to consider the option of peer mentors becoming part of the project in order to empower young people and give young people a voice in shaping the future of POP. Funding has been applied for and we are waiting for a decision- fingers crossed!”
Over 11 nights POP have delivered brief interventions to 191 young people.
Areas within Gateshead covered have been: Carr Hill,  Fewster Square, Bankies Felling, Team Valley, Dunston Park, Birtley, Felling Square, Leam Lane.
Brief interventions were delivered around Sexual health, harm reduction, stop smoking, school behaviour and exclusions, Routines and boundaries, offending behaviour, emotional well being and mental health, employment, training and education, Drug and alcohol, Delay message/c-card, Platform, anti-social behaviour, physical health, exploitation and grooming, overdose.
Case Study 1
December 2016
Platform received a referral from QE hospital for a girl 15yrs who was admitted after allegedly using ecstasy.  The Platform worker followed procedures and offered numerous appointments via letter and phone calls, however the young person did not attend any of these.
Mid-January 2017
During POP work in January in Fewster Square Felling, the staff met a group of girls.  They introduced themselves and what the purpose of POP .  One of the girls recognised the name Platform and stated ‘I was supposed to go there’.  From this conversation the staff were able to promote Platform, giving the young person various options of how and when she could be seen and highlighted how beneficial it could be for her if she engaged.   As a result she decided that she did want to engage and would like to be seen at school.  Staff informed her that they would speak to her key worker and get things moving.
February 2017
Following the update from POP the Platform Keyworker made contact with the most appropriate person at school for the young person, and a home visit was arranged.
March 2017
The young person has now engaged in two full sessions with her keyworker from Platform.  They have devised a care plan and worked on interventions around the risks of ecstasy ensuring that the young person has a good baseline knowledge which will help her make informed choices around her substance use.
Case study 2
As part of the outreach work staff introduced themselves to the local shopkeepers who stated they were having problems with young people outside their shops.
The Fish and chip owner talked about how he has had his business over 19 years and due to the amount of Young people displaying anti – social behaviour outside his shop, he believed his business had rapidly declined. The shopkeeper stated that he is racially abused on a daily basis and he knows all the Young people involved. He has had CCTV installed and this shows the extent of the anti – social behaviour.
The shop keeper stated he has reported this to the police but the young people move on when they see the police, but then they return and then become verbally abusive to him for calling the police. He strongly believes that if the bus stop was removed outside his shop this would stop the Young people remaining outside of the shop. The shopkeeper stated he has spoken to the local council and the local counsellor however feels nothing has changed. POP informed him that they would discuss this issue with the relevant people.
It was highlighted by the police that the shopkeeper will not pass on the name of the young people and therefore there is little they can do without this information.  The POP staff returned to the shop owner and explained this however he states he is too scared to do this.
Although this issue was not resolved, the shopkeeper thanked staff for listening and responding to his concerns.

Upgraded emergency first aid kits







 
Home » Upgraded emergency first aid kits





								Thursday 18th May 2017							


DISC News


DISC Health and Safety Manager St​eve Totty is upgrading safety standards in all our hot food kitchens with the introduction of a first aid kit in the event of anyone suffering burns.
View the video
Steve says: “It’s basically an emergency burns station that we’re going to roll out across the business into any of the premises where we prepare hot food.
“As a caring organisation, we want to make sure we have the right facilities should for any reason any member of staff or volunteer or service user injure themselves while preparing hot food.
“So at least there’s some appropriate medication to deal with it, until we get some proper medical help.”
Steve, who is about to launch new Health and Safety Management System and Fire Management manuals within the organisation, has asked that any DISC staff and volunteers, or service users, who have any health and safety concerns should contact him by phoning our head office in Newton Aycliffe on 01325 731160.

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


Staff at the Wear Recovery drug and alcohol service took part in ‘Wear on our Feet’ as part of the On Your Feet Britain campaign.
The campaign unites workers across Britain and encourages participation in a variety of fun and simple activities to sit less and move more at work.
DISC worker Mel Scott said: “The staff were keen to get involved and as part of the campaign, we put up posters around the building which outlined the benefits of sitting less and easy ways to move more while at work.
“These hints and tips included things like; Standing to take a call, eating lunch away from your desk, and walking to see colleagues rather than calling.”
The posters and information also educated us as a team on some of the health risks we can all face from sitting too long.  So we decided to go for it!
Mel explained staff came to work on the day in their trainers and gym clothes.
“We decided that we would all do 1 minute of ‘movement’ every 30 minutes as suggested in all the literature.  To make it a little more fun we all chose an exercise or dance move and we picked one out of the in tray  – we didn’t have a hat –  every 30 minutes.
“Some of the moves were more difficult than others and made a few of us think that we need to improve our fitness. Moves included; the Irish jig, the plank, wall squats, weights, and a new move we now call ‘the Jane’ name after our senior admin within the SPOC Team.
And Mel added: “We need to support our staff to stay and feel healthy.  A healthy workforce can often mean better performance, less sickness and most of all a positive effect on those who access our services.
“The whole team got involved and as well as having fun we all agreed how important it is to keep health as a team. We are all looking forward to the next campaign…watch this space.”

Home » Service User Forum, Selby, North Yorkshire Horizons





								Monday 22nd May 2017							


North Yorkshire Horizons


A Service Users’ Forum was held on Friday 28th April.


North Yorkshire Horizons

There was a general discussion about the service provided by NYH; and Service Users present were all pleased with the service.
The new Women’s Group was discussed.  It is off to a good start; a possible alternative (and larger) venue has been identified and is being investigated.  There seems to be absolutely zero interest in forming a Men’s Group.
There was a discussion about SMART Recovery – what is currently happening and hopes for a new Group focussed on the needs of the local Polish community.  Also the possibility of a day-time SMART session was discussed.
It was noted that there will be no Café on Monday (1st May) due to Bank Holiday; Service Users said that they miss the Café when it does not happen.  The possibility of Service Users meeting, independently of NYH, on these dates was discussed.  It has been done before and could be helpful to all concerned.
Concern was expressed about people attending Café, or SMART, under the influence of a substance. The meetings need to be open to folk seeking help; but it is harmful to the group as a whole if someone is disruptive.
There was discussion, following on from last month, about the possibility of a picnic or some other outing.  Various ideas were taken away to be thought about.
A concern was raised about printed material in Black & White being uninteresting and not engaging the audience.  Everyone agreed that more colour is needed.

DISC News


Health and social care charity DISC and Leeds-based community interest company St Martin’s Healthcare Services, have completed their merger.
The two organisations have worked together successfully since 2008 including working in partnership on major substance misuse services in Leeds, Calderdale and Barnsley.
Paul Townsley, Chief Executive Officer of DISC said: “We’re really excited today about the merger of St Martin’s and DISC because we can now offer clinical services within DISC.
“It means we will be able to offer a range of health and medical services to our clients across the different services we provide with an opportunity to improve health outcomes.
“There’s been a lot of hard work over recent months and we can now bring the skills and knowledge of both organisations into one.
“We have an excellent offer for the communities we serve and this clinical offer, which St Martin’s brings, will add so much value to our substance misuse, housing, employment and young people and family services.”
The organisation, which will go forward as DISC, will offer a range of impactful and innovative health and social care services and an integrated model of care.
Angela Walker, Chief Executive Office of SMHS said “We are delighted to be merging with DISC, providing the opportunity to offer a fully integrated health and social care model to clients”.
“I am pleased to have led SMHS to this exciting development and to now be joining DISC and helping to ensure a full and effective integration of the two organisations”
DISC has been working since the mid-1980s to provide services for the vulnerable and disadvantaged in local communities. In the current financial year, it will help over 12,000 people.
DISC staff are based at its headquarters in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, in service provision across the North East, Yorkshire, the Humber and the North West and will now expand to have a regional office in Leeds.  Services include the Moretime Social Enterprise, Housing and Independent Living Support, Health Young People and Families, Employment Training and Education and Substance Misuse.

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services
Independent living and housing related support



DISC CEO Paul Townsley speaks about his thoughts following a visit to The Greens, in Sheffield. The recovery focused accommodation is situated in award winning buildings in the city.
Paul spoke with many of the residents, as well as DISC workers. What became apparent, he said, was that many residents felt they were in safe, secure place and were valued by staff.
The Greens has some 15 en-suite rooms and six additional flats for residents who can stay several months at a time. The project offers practical and therapeutic support while preparing residents to move on and perhaps re-establish themselves in the community and with family.
Paul says: “At DISC, what we’re really about is giving people hope…
“Our staff and managers and volunteers help people help themselves. We offer really practical and structured support to people when they need it.”

Volunteering


DISC will bring together members of its volunteer workforce at the Recovery Academy, off Burley Road in Leeds to say thank you and to celebrate their work.
Ann Hall, Volunteer Manager for DISC, (pictured) said: “Those attending the event will hear from people in addiction who have been inspired by volunteers to turn their lives around.
“They will also hear from staff who were previously DISC volunteers who believe that without the opportunity of volunteering with us, gaining valuable skills and experiences, that they wouldn’t have landed their dream job at DISC.”
She said: “Volunteers are an integral part of our organisation and we want to show them our appreciation, say thank you and celebrate all the benefits of volunteering.
“During 2016/17 our volunteers contributed a total of 13,284 hours of their own time, supporting DISC achieve its mission and vision, on average we had 74 active volunteers in post at any one time.”
Volunteers will be travelling to Leeds from DISC projects across the North of England.
Ann Lofthouse, a volunteer turned staff member said: “I’ve gained a lot of invaluable skills and experience volunteering, and my confidence through training with DISC has developed massively.”
Volunteers undertake a variety of roles across DISC’s services, including facilitation roles, doing outreach, supporting the administration teams, helping with the events management, and direct work befriending, as well as meeting and greeting the clients.
DISC offers services covering drugs and alcohol, housing related support, housing, employment, training and education, health and well-being, children, young people and families, women, criminal justice and community and offender rehabilitation.
The event will take place from 10am to 12pm on 2 June at the Leeds Recovery Academy, 43 Westfield Road, Leeds, LS3 1NQ.

DISC service receives glowing report

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


A DISC drug and alcohol misuse service has received a glowing report from inspectors in being awarded the Quality for Health standard in Calderdale.
Calderdale Recovery Steps was found to have excellent systems and processes. It found people who use the service were well informed and involved in deciding appropriate professional support. Literature about treatment options was clear and easily available.
The service which is led by Northern communities’ the charity DISC and has premises in St John’s Lane, Halifax and Burnley Road, Todmorden was also found to have excellent systems in place to ensure service users’ safeguarding and their health and safety.
Inspectors found “robust” systems to agree, measure and record how service users were helped.  Staff were well supported, set targets for outcomes to be achieved but this did not detract from the very person centred approach that was “clearly demonstrated through interviews with staff”.
A wide range of health promotion activities and an “holistic” approach were also identified by inspectors.
Dave Targett, an Assistant Director of DISC in Calderdale, said: “We are delighted with the report we have received from Quality for Health Calderdale. The feedback is very positive, and we are pleased that many areas of excellence have been identified by the auditor.”
More information…

Wear Recovery


‘

The Recovery Tree’ encompasses a belief that recovery is like planting a tree.
Our workers say: “When you decide to seek help, you are planting the seed. Please feel free to contribute your thoughts to our Empire House Wear Recovery Tree.”
Service users don’t give any personal details. They are asked to document any beliefs they may have had before coming into the service – they add those to the roots.add to the roots.
Any positive thoughts about their recovery are added as leaves.

North Yorkshire Horizons


Hardworking staff take time out
North Yorkshire Horizons’ Selby hub has held a staff well being afternoon as part of the 2017 Mental Health Week.
Rebecca Kendall, of North Yorkshire Horizons, said staff welfare and well being is of a high priority. The event allowed the opportunity for staff to relax and experience some of the holistic therapies available within the hub.The afternoon started with a joint lunch which everybody contributed to and it allowed staff the time to talk and build relationships.
Staff were able to enjoy acupuncture, relaxation, Indian head massage, hand massage plus a fun game at the end.
Rebecca said: “The afternoon was thoroughly enjoyed by all. Often we are so focused on helping others that we forget about our own well being. The staff well being days have been really appreciated by staff, they have all commented how relaxed they felt at the end of the day. Also, it’s useful for staff to experience the holistic therapies offered so they then promote this to service users.

“We plan to make this a regular event!”
Staff member Sam Thomson said: “I really enjoyed the staff well-being day. I think it is great for team building as all staff contributed to this day and shared skills which aren’t always used within our day to day work. We feel it really helps with staff morale and well being and that we feel valued by management.’’

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services
North Yorkshire Horizons


DISC’s North Yorkshire Horizons drug and alcohol recovery service has introduced a new scheme for its service users, which they gain greatly from.
On a Thursday afternoon the Northallerton hub’s garage bursts into activity and becomes home to a group of service users who are working towards a qualification in furniture restoring and upcycling, ably guided by the patient and knowledgeable tutor, Tracey.
The service users are each responsible for designing and undertaking their own projects.
This involves many elements includes planning, risk assessing, sourcing resources, sanding and painting and many other tasks which will result in a bespoke product which can be sold, to make the project sustainable.   The projects include, chairs, a book case, sewing stool and a table.
A North Yorkshire Horizons worker said: “In creating their projects the participants have shown imagination and vision.   Everyone is learning new skills and gaining enjoyment from seeing the result of their hard work.   After careful planning, practical work has now begun, this has been taken with great enthusiasm, with news of the project spreading.”
One of the service users said, “learning new skills in great” and another commented how much they looked forward to coming every week.”
Our worker added: “As the course progresses, the service users are gaining confidence and are helping each other.
“The many skills are transferable allowing future projects to be undertaken by the participants and providing possible employment opportunities are well as allowing them to see how much they can achieve.”

Forward Leeds creates Book Club for clients at Waterstones

								Saturday 10th June 2017							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


Forward Leeds, the city’s alcohol and drug service has partnered with Waterstones book shop in Leeds to create a book club for people in treatment with the service.

The idea for Read4Recovery first came from the clients of Forward Leeds who were keen to find activities to absorb and entertain them away from alcohol and/or drugs. Waterstones Leeds were happy to offer their support immediately.
Gemma Patterson, Recovery Coordinator at Forward Leeds said: “Books offer a new world, escapism, distraction and a positive way to spend time. Books may be something the public take for granted but it can be a game changer for people with addiction. It gives people something other than drugs to focus on, which is vital in building up social connections and improving interactions.
Gemma continued: “The Forward Leeds book club offers people an insight into how being connected to others in a positive light can give them the motivation and strength to fight an addiction”.
Ged Rumfitt manager of Waterstones Leeds said: “We are delighted to be working with Forward Leeds on this. Reading for pleasure is an amazing form of entertainment. The enjoyment and the benefits you can get from a great book cannot be underestimated and there is such a huge choice to pick from.”
The Read4Recovery book club will meet monthly and initially Waterstones will provide books along with suitable book suggestions. The plan is for the club to quickly become self-sufficient while continuing to partner with Waterstones on ideas and recommendations.

Platform Gateshead’s commitment to the emotional well-being of staff.







 
Home » Platform Gateshead’s commitment to the emotional well-being of staff.





								Wednesday 21st June 2017							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


The emotional impact of work done at DISC can take its toll on our staff and volunteers. The organisation’s adoption of Better Health at Work strategies is aimed at combating the stress and to help out workers relax when they can.
Faye Codling, Project Leader at Platform Gateshead,  said: “At Platform Gateshead, we recognise that the nature of our work can often impact on our emotional well-being. So, as part of Platform’s objective for Better Health at Work, we have implemented a number of strategies to support us as a team.
“Our Buddy system involves members of staff using an identified buddy in the team to speak to for support if they need an outlet for their feelings.
“And due to the dedication of staff, we’re often guilty of working through our lunch and therefore never having time out in the day. It’s important to have a break and so we’ve now got Lunch space– we have an identified area within the office, between 12-2pm for staff to move away from their desks and have lunch.”
Suggestions from staff also included relaxing candles and chakra crystals within the office which are now also in place. There is a monthly well-being hour –  which involves the team taking part in an activity to support their emotional well-being. This includes activities such as coffee and cake, mindfulness, colouring in for adults etc.

Staff also have the option to spend time down at Platform Planters’ allotment to involve themselves in some physical activity to improve their emotional wellbeing.

Volunteer Event a great success

Volunteering


And… relax …
We’ve had an extremely busy volunteers week across DISC. There have been project based presentations, the #ivolunteer campaign and our Volunteers Week celebration event.
Volunteers and their supervisors from across DISC attended the event in Leeds. Volunteers spoke openly about their experiences and there were occasions when a number of us were moved to tears, hearing how much of a powerful impact volunteering has had on people’s lives. Hearing these experiences completely reinforces why I do this job and love it.
I’d like to thank all the volunteers for attending and their supervisors for taking volunteers under their wings and a special thanks to Ezra for capturing the day on film, Mollie for helping me to organise the event and to Kulwant who led on the signing activity.
If you’re on Twitter check out #ivolunteer and you may see some familiar faces from across DISC.
Throughout June we have appointed volunteers in projects where we have never had them before, one being the Homeless Prevention Service in Hambleton where the manager Jane and I appointed Wioleta who is going to translate for Polish speaking service users, support staff on outreach and eventually lead on a drop in. We have also appointed 5 volunteers in the Salford Family Support Service, Michaela the Volunteer Coordinator has done an excellent job of implementing the volunteer programme there and I am looking forward to facilitating their induction training this week.
We have 15 volunteer vacancies on mydiscjobs so it’s going to be a very busy time recruiting and inducting volunteers and I hope you will all join me to welcome all new recruits as they arrive in projects.
Volunteers Week may be over but we will still fly the volunteer flag on a daily basis.
Ann Hall, Volunteer Development Manager.

Council extends funding for the Platform Outreach Project (POP)!







 
Home » Council extends funding for the Platform Outreach Project (POP)!





								Wednesday 21st June 2017							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


Following on from the success of POP (Platform Outreach Project), the project has received six months’ further funding from Gateshead Council Community Safety.
The POP project was developed within Platform Gateshead as a way to begin to explore how to address substance misuse, anti-social behaviour and risk taking behaviour amongst young people in identified hotspot areas across the borough. During our 3 month pilot (over 11 nights) POP have delivered brief interventions to 191 young people.
POP workers Kirsty Martin and Lyndsy Richardson are delighted
Faye Codling- Project Leader for Platform Gateshead  said: “This additional funding will give our dedicated workers POP workers Kirsty Martin and Lyndsy Richardson  the opportunity to carry on with their fantastic work with young people, engaging in risk taking and anti-social behaviour in the borough of Gateshead. The project will begin again in July 2017.
 Kirsty said: “I’m overjoyed that this fantastic project continues to support young people out in the community.”
And Lyndsey  said: “I’m really pleased that the Community Safety Team and the police are recognising this work and how positive it is for the young people who don’t engage in services.”
Faye added: “Kirsty and Lyndsy have made POP a success with their dedication and passion to support young people.
“I’m very proud of their achievements over the 3 month pilot and I am confident they will provide support and interventions for many other young people over the next 6 months.”

Encouraging service users to discuss Recovery







 
Home » Encouraging service users to discuss Recovery





								Monday 26th June 2017							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services
Wear Recovery


Recovery Tree at Wear Recovery’s Empire House.
Service Users are being encouraged to record their thoughts on one of our Recovery Trees, which are in each of our hubs.
A DISC  worker said: “When a client seeks help, they plant a seed. The sprouting leaves denote the things that come out of an individual’s recovery.
“The idea is to generate discussion about Recovery.  Clients are encouraged to write their recovery stories and/or statements on leaves to inspire others and to promote mutual self help. Statements can be positive or negative, as long as they reflect recovery.
“The tree symbolises Recovery  by encouraging service users to identify their ‘contemplation’ statements and core beliefs as part of the roots to their recovery. As the tree grows, so does their confidence and motivation to work towards their treatment goal.”

Opening up education to service users

								Friday 23rd June 2017

Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services
Employment, Training and Education


​A dozen Forward Leeds clients, some still in treatment and some former clients attended a session at the University of Leeds to gain insights into accessing further and higher education.
Graham Hale, Education, Training and Employment Worker for Forward Leeds said: “It was like watching light bulbs go on above our clients heads. They realised that educational opportunities at university level were not the preserve on an ‘elite’ and were available to everyone, including them”.
​They met staff from the University as well as the Learning Champions who are people with similar life experiences who have studied up to Masters level at the University.
They were offered a taster lesson and a tour of the University as well as advice and guidance.
Several of those who attended signed up for the University’s Summer Schools there and then.
Forward Leeds are looking to make these sessions a regular thing for clients.

5 Ways at the Recovery Academy







 
Home » 5 Ways at the Recovery Academy





								Tuesday 27th June 2017							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


The Recovery Academy, run by Forward Leeds, is to be renamed the 5 WAYS @ the Recovery Academy, on June 30th.
The name, which was chosen by the current members, reflects the five ways to improve mental well-being. A new logo and branding has been created for 5 WAYS that reflects this.
5 WAYS takes its name from the evidence that suggests there are five steps we can all take to improve our mental wellbeing.
They are: 
Connect with other people
Be active and exercise
Keep learning
Give to others
Be mindful
The Leeds recovery community will be celebrating on the 30th of June with an Open Mic Night to launch the new name.
5 WAYS offers a wide range of activities and structured group work for those in recovery, including guitar lessons, yoga, an IT suite, a gardening group, SMART groups and much more.
It is an informal and welcoming space where individuals can choose their own courses and activities and plan their own recovery journeys based on what they prefer and not someone else’s idea of what they need.
Many of the sessions are co-facilitated and co-produced by people with lived experience of substance use.
Membership of 5 WAYS is for adults who are 18+ who are in recovery or coming to the end of their treatment journey.

DISC aims for renewal of Investors in Volunteers’ accreditation







 
Home » DISC aims for renewal of Investors in Volunteers’ accreditation





								Tuesday 27th June 2017							


DISC News
Volunteering


DISC is seeking renewal in 2018 of the Investing in Volunteers Award it achieved in 2015.

Ann Hall, Volunteer Development Manager, said: “Investing in Volunteers (IiV)  is the gold standard for effective management of volunteers and we are committed to retaining our very important accreditation.
“Our volunteers are an incredibly effective part of the offering we bring to our service users. Their time, commitment, life experience and skills are valued by our staff and service users. In return for this, the volunteering opportunities we can provide can give them satisfying roles and a real pathway to paid employment and further training.
In 2016/17, 13,824 volunteer hours were completed for DISC by an average of 80 people.
The organisation must conform to nine indicators set by Investors in Volunteers.
Ann added: ““The Investors in Volunteers accreditation shows our potential volunteers and reassures our existing volunteer workforce that we are committed to ensuring a positive experience for them.”
Please see our latest Volunteers Bulletin, a special edition to celebrate our annual Volunteers Event.

10,000 Volunteer Hours at North Yorkshire Horizons







 
Home » 10,000 Volunteer Hours at North Yorkshire Horizons





								Friday 30th June 2017							


DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services
North Yorkshire Horizons
Volunteering


Over 10,000 hours of time and experience have been given freely in the last year by volunteers working within North Yorkshire Horizons.
Steve Flood, Horizons’ Volunteer coordinator, said: “People get involved for a variety of reasons – developing skills,  to develop their own confidence, to find out things about themselves perhaps they didn’t know, to support the community.
“At the minute we’ve got an average of 35 volunteers who support us across North Yorkshire which is pretty good going.
“Our  volunteers make an extensive contribution to our service and by giving that time effectively for free you give as much time as work for you as a volunteer up to say let’s take 16 hours so we’ve got people doing a couple of hours a week and we’ve got people doing a couple of days a week. It’s really what fits into your diary.”

Open Mic Night at newly renamed DISC recovery centre

Forward Leeds



The Leeds recovery community launched the new name of a support centre when the Recovery Academy, run by local drug and alcohol service Forward Leeds, was renamed 5 WAYS @ the Recovery Academy. The change was celebrated with an Open Mic Night by and for those in recovery.

The launch brought together a number of performers in recovery, to mark their success, alongside the people who attend 5 WAYS. As well as the new name the night was also about the achievements of everyone in Leeds who has taken many positive steps on their road to recovery.

Jo Byrden the manager of 5 WAYS said: “I was genuinely moved by some of the performances and equally impressed by the talent that was shared”.

  Jo continued: “The evening was not only a celebration of recovery in Leeds but also about the launch of the new name for the recovery venue. The name ‘5 WAYS’ was voted by people in recovery who regularly attend the venue”.


Performers on the night included musicians, poets, comedy and spoken word performances.


The name 5 WAYS, which was chosen by the current members, reflects the five ways to improve mental well-being. The five ways are; connect, be active, take notice, keep learning and give. A new logo and branding has been created for 5 WAYS that reflects this.

New Drug Strategy: DISC ideally placed

Home » New Drug Strategy: DISC ideally placed





								Friday 14th July 2017							


CEO Blog
DISC News
Drugs & Alcohol Recovery Services


DISC is ideally placed following the publication of the  new National Drug Strategy
DISC is really pleased to welcome the new Drug Strategy.
One of the four pillars of the government’s new Drugs Strategy is to support recovery with a National Recovery Champion to ensure adequate housing, employment and mental health services are available to people to turn their lives around. At DISC, we’re in the exciting position of already being able to provide the range of services set out.
We are uniquely placed to do this as a social and health care organisation providing substance use, clinical, employment training and education, housing,  housing support and health, young people and families services.
The Home Secretary has stressed the need for working in partnerships. Once again, this chimes with DISC’s long established model. We work in partnerships with a range of providers to deliver local solutions.
We do make a plea to protect funding and start from the solid base of what we have achieved to date. Our services need protecting and enhancing.
We would welcome protection of our strategy of working which is based on what we know works for our service users, their families and the communities which we serve. This is set out in four principles:

The need for a continued focus on helping people recover.
The minimising of the harm people do to themselves and reducing deaths is critical to our work.
Having a range of prevention interventions available to young people, adults and families.
Being able to provide practical help that moves people away from problematic use such as skills-based work; housing is also pivotal to sustained recovery.

DISC CEO

Volunteering


A call has gone out for more donations of furniture for a social enterprise set up to help local people.
Father and son, John and Paul Oliver, both volunteer for More Time in Newton Aycliffe.  A steady stream of customers at the showroom in the DISC headquarters next to the Blue Bridge in Newton Aycliffe means they need more good quality second-hand goods.
John, a volunteer for three years, says: “We’re always willing to receive donations in reusable condition.
“We’re looking for more household goods and we have the skills within the team here at More Time to refurbish old furniture to bring them back to standard. The furniture is reasonably priced for those on a budget or anyone on the lookout for a bargain!
John said he enjoyed “the family atmosphere within the team”.
And his son, Paul added: “I want to encourage local people to get in touch if they have any furniture that they no longer want; we offer a free collection service if needed.”
Dawn McCreanor, More Time Business Manager, said: “All the money raised from the sale of these goods goes back into the More Time service, helping local people develop new skills with the aim of them securing employment in the future.
“Volunteering opportunities within the warehouse, showroom and in the on-site café are available.”
Anyone who would like to donate household goods can call in or telephone 01325 731294.  More Time is based at The IES Centre, Horndale Avenue, Aycliffe Business Park (near the Blue Bridge), The More Time furniture showroom is open Monday to Saturday between 9am until 4pm.
PHOTO:  Paul and John Oliver are on hand to help at the More Time store.
ENDS
 
NOTE TO EDITORS: More Time Furniture Scheme provides good quality second-hand furniture at reasonable prices, enabling local people to source the furniture they need, with a cost effective delivery option for those people who don’t have access to a delivery van.
It also provides fully certified house clearance services for those people who need to have bulky/unwanted items removed from their property.

GOALs service users enjoy being upcycling peer mentors







 
Home » GOALs service users enjoy being upcycling peer mentors





								Thursday 03rd August 2017							


DISC News
Health & Well-being


Four DISC service users  have each said they’ve enjoyed taking up a new role of peer mentoring other service users in DISC’s GOALS project.
Ayeesha Simmons, Lynda Hartley, David Robson and Beverley Lynn, who had all previously completed a furniture up cycling course with County Durham Family information Service’s Recycld project.
The GOALs project provides life enriching support services across County Durham for adults with learning disabilities.
Anne Knapton, project leader, said: “They were asked to support six service users who were doing upcycling for the first time.  The helpers became peer mentor supporters and used their skills to support others.  Ayeesha, Lynda, David and Beverley have developed their skills, gained confidence and helped support others.”
Recycled tutor, Jackie said: “It’s especially nice to see people being able to move on after they have undertaken courses with us. I do know that Ayeesha, Linda, Bev and Dave have all undertaken a recycled course previously.
I think it’s brilliant that GOALs is offering those opportunities to people. I think it;s very very important to remember that they’re adults and they need to experience real life.”

Ayeesha said: “It feels great for me to be able to help my friends around the course.”
The best bit was “helping people with learning difficulties and people in wheelchairs”.
And Ayeesha added: “It makes me feel great to help them.
Project manager Ann said: “DISC believe people should reach their potential and GOALS have enabled service users to develop their skills and to become peer mentor supporters.

Salford Project ensures local safeguarding compliance







 
Home » Salford Project ensures local safeguarding compliance





								Thursday 03rd August 2017							


DISC News
Health, Children, Young People & Families


Salford Intensive Family Intervention Project, which was recently awarded a renewal of its contract has been working with Salford Council to strongly reflect the council’s safeguarding policy in its own working practices.
Project Manager, Cathy Unsworth said: “The reason that this has to be done was that when we were awarded the new contract in Salford, I had to submit evidence to the commissioners that we had safe and reliable child protection procedures in place.
“This was quite a lengthy and detailed process as there were 24 standards we were measured against. I submitted a copy of DISC’s safeguarding children’s policy and guidance.”
New documents for service users as well as staff were produced to explain local guidance. The Salford project’s page on the DISC website was updated with further information and now points those concerned about a child’s welfare to access Salford Council’s worried about a child information. The local Bridge Partnership is also signposted.
Cathy said: “We had to ensure we are contract compliant but it is good and safe practice to be aware of the local safeguarding procedures and how they link with DISC procedures.
“We produced a document that was circulated to all our staff here and we’ve also circulated a flow chart to ensure that everyone can easily understand what needs to be done.”

A partnership approach
DISC offers a common sense, holistic approach in a wide range of services. 
Working in partnership is at the heart of how we do things. We partner with Government organisations, local authorities and a host of other agencies, right through to individual service users and carers.

Working for people and communities
For over 30 years, DISC has been helping people and their communities in the North. 
We support hundreds of families, run LGBT services, drug and alcohol services, manage homelessness schemes, acclaimed employment training programmes and offender resettlement schemes.
About Us








We’re “Outstanding” say Ofsted
Ofsted say our programmes for young, vulnerable people are "Outstanding"  and an example of "Best Practice". They say our success reflects "high levels of personal support from DISC staff and a curriculum that incorporates high quality work experience.”

Our History









Home » About » Our History 

History
DISC was incorporated as a registered charity and company limited by guarantee in 1984. It operated initially as Durham Training and Enterprise, and its focus then was mainly on vocational preparation programmes for long term unemployed young people in County Durham.
By the late 80s, our remit had broadened into working with offenders, including alternatives to custody for young offenders and intensive probation for adults. DISC then led the development of innovative services for people who were homeless through the establishment of ‘accommodation registers and independent living support for care leavers.
In 1992, to accommodate the increasing breadth of the organisation’s work and its expansion beyond County Durham, we changed our name to Developing Initiatives Supporting Communities (DISC).
Since then, we have continued to expand our portfolio of services and geographical coverage. We  now provide specialist services across the North East, Yorkshire and Humber and the North West. We’re now one of the Northern England’s most successful home grown charities.
We provide affordable accommodation as a Registered Social Landlord via DISC Housing and promote volunteering/employment opportunities through More Time UK, DISC’s social enterprise.
CHECK QUOTE

Chair of the Board, Jim Black, who has supported DISC since its formation, said: “I’m extremely proud of the outcomes that we have helped people to achieve.  Our board recognises that a common denominator in our achievements is the passion of our workforce.”

Satisfying work in accomodation service









Home » Satisfying work in accomodation service 

“I love to see people grow and change”
‘The satisfaction I get from my work is about seeing people change. I get such an amazing feeling seeing someone transform in the time we work with them, from their rock bottom to moving on into independent living.
“Being a small part of someone else’s recovery gives me such a thrill.  I love to see people grow and change, from working with them in group settings to seeing them tackle problems independently knowing they have the skills to be successful.
An excellent reputation
“I also get enormous satisfaction from knowing The Greens has an excellent reputation in Sheffield and that professionals want to place their clients with us as they know we have excellent success in supporting our service users.
“All of this wouldn’t be possible without a brilliant staff team and manager, who make The Greens what it is, and a place where I really enjoy coming to work every day.”
Marie Dodds
Project Leader
DISC, The Greens (Accommodation Service), 
Sheffield

Partnership Working


Partnership Working is at the heart of how we do things. DISC works alongside Government organisations, local authorities, local business and a host of other agencies, right through to individual service users and carers.






Home » partnerships 

Strong partnership working
To us, multi-agency partnerships are incredibly important. They help deliver integrated services to meet all of a person’s needs. DISC values the additional skills, experience and knowledge partners can bring. Partnership working is embedded in our business model.
Partner with us
If you’d like to talk to us about working in partnership, click here to fill out our partnership form. Or you can email us aqt  partnerships@disc-vol.org.uk with your contact information and how we can work together and we’ll get back to you.
Our approach to partnership working
Our services cut across criminal justice, drug and alcohol recovery, learning and employment, housing and support for children and families. But we couldn’t do what we do without working in partnership.
We see everyone who helps to achieve success for our service users as a partner. They may be the service user themselves, their support worker, a parent or friend, our commissioners or organisations we contract with.
Using local knowledge and expertise
We’re committed to meeting the needs of the people who use our services. We’re one of the largest charity providers in the North of England. And we’ve got an established role in social inclusion services. We focus on giving service users packages of specialist support.
Meeting specific needs
Our contract delivery partnerships use local knowledge and expertise. This has the added benefit of helping secure the future of small local organisations. DISC has a strong history of partnership working. As well as partnering with large organisations, we support and giving voice to local organisations who know their communities well.

I’ve been volunteering for 2 years now. I think the work that Disc does is important because we help service users with things like housing, benefits, even basic necessities like food and helping them to pay bills and with all normal aspects of life. For our service users at DIP/ IOM especially because some of them have just recently come out of prison, so that’s a big help for them and you can really see that they appreciate it. 



Madalina Cristea – Volunteer at Leeds DIP IOM



















Steve Littlewood – Senior practitioner & support worker for Leeds DIP IOM
We do lots of things to improve the mind-set. The reason I work for Disc is because I like working with people. We deal with people. They’re not units, they’re not statistics; they’re people.
If we didn’t support people in their recovery, in their journey to getting a meaningful life, the numbers of those needing help would be greater and there would be little other support.
People with a lot of complex needs tend to slip through the cracks. We provide a safe place for them here, we do a lot of outreach and we provide them, sometimes, with a reason to get up in the morning.
If you didn’t have organisations like Disc you would have a lot more people in and out of prison and using drugs; it’s a cycle. We help people maintain stability and help them try to live as much of an ordinary life as possible.



Steve Littlewood – Senior practitioner & support worker for Leeds DIP IOM



















"I was keen to learn from this course how to be both professional and supportive as well as actually how to support a service user to make focused, practical changes in their lives. I am good at building rapport and breaking the ice but the session on active listening and the many forms of communication one can use in a mentor/mentee relationship was really valuable to me."
DISC Peer Mentor course attendee ref CDPM1230216 



How to be both professional and supportive



















"Since doing each session of peer mentor training, I can feel my self-worth, my strengths and hopes for the future growing...I have come away knowing that my current strengths are mainly based on a personal basis."
Peer Mentor ref CDPM1230216



I can feel my self-worth growing



















Peer Mentor ref PJPM1230216
"Coming towards the end of the six week peer mentoring course with mixed emotions really, I will actually miss the course and all the people doing it with me (great group). Although, on the other hand pleased I have finally completed the course as I have been waiting a while for a peer mentoring course to start.
"The group work has been really good as it has made the learning very interesting and I always think it’s great to learn from each other. The teaching of the course has been brilliant, all very clear and at a nice place to learn.
  "The role of peer mentor is definitely for me as I feel I have a valuable range of life experience to share when needed.  Group work is something I sued to fear but now with the practice gained from the course I am able to get involved in a confident manner. All in all great course and something I am very passionate about moving forward in my own recovery journey. The course has been extremely useful for me and the skills learnt I will take with me into a role hopefully full time at some point.
  "We went into policies including health and safety, equal opportunities and confidentiality. This gave me an insight into where and who to go to if I have problems in the workplace."
Peer Mentor ref CDPM1230216
"I have found the peer mentoring course very interesting and it has been something I have wanted to pursue for some time now. We did a scenario on communication skills this really helped me to grow in confidence as I know in the past I would have struggled with things like that. Since doing each session of peer mentor training, I can feel my self-worth, my strengths and hopes for the future growing.
  "The first session helped me to consolidate my understanding of the role. Session six was an invaluable session, I have come away knowing that my current strengths are mainly based on a personal basis."
Peer Mentor ref CDPM1230216
"I was keen to learn from this course how to be both professional and supportive as well as actually how to support a service user to make focused, practical changes in their lives. I am good at building rapport and breaking the ice but the session on active listening and the many forms of communication one can use in a mentor/mentee relationship was really valuable to me."
Peer Mentor ref BRPM1230216
"I have learnt a lot on this course and have become a lot more knowledgeable about the role of a peer mentor. I have gained great knowledge on signposting from not living in the area long, I knew of very few services but attending this course has shown me there are lots of different services and education available. The teaching methods have been made very clear and make sure everyone understands them before moving on to another topic.
Peer Mentor ref SRPM1230216
"The peer mentoring course has been both interesting and informative in all its aspects. The course has provided guidelines for the health and safety for all concerned and clearly defined the boundaries for the mentor.
   "Hypothetical scenarios have been useful in illustrating how a mentor/mentee relationship may play out and has been valuable in showing possible problems which may arise, they have also helped how to put into practice what has been learnt. I have enjoyed my time on the course. It has been made clear that any questions or problems that may arise can be referred to supervisors or key workers for clarity."
Peer Mentor ref PKPM1230216
"Loved it and learnt so much."
Peer Mentor ref DDPM1230216
"I’ve learnt a lot during this course and will be happy to further my skills in the substance misuse area as a peer mentor. I will be trying to show people how my experiences led me to the place I’m  at now, I’m diverse I’m understanding and empathetic.
"I’m looking forward to furthering my education and qualifications so that in the near future I will achieve my goal of becoming a drug worker or something similar.
Peer Mentor ref DTPM1230216
"Before starting the peer mentoring course I was very anxious and nervous. Since starting the group sessions I have felt supported by the tutor and the group. My confidence has grown and I feel more able to use my voice. I just feel I want to give something back as a peer mentor supporting others that are going through what I’ve been through."
  Full details of these peer mentors retained on file.



DISC Peer Mentoring course testimonials



















“As a landlord, I am very pleased with DISC’s Housing Service, as it offers landlords and people in need, support with relevant professional help.
“DISC works with private landlords and helps tenants who would otherwise find it hard to seek a home to live in and tenants are supported through the entire process of their rehabilitation.”
Mr Mitchell lists a series of “benefits of a DISC lease as a private landlord", including…
“All clients are risk assessed to ensure they are safe to be in the community and are not a risk to others in the community.
“DISC’s private landlords are paid monthly and the landlords’ responsibility is passed to DISC in accordance with the lease agreement.
“Many landlords prior to partnering with DISC would have been unable to afford the cost of repairing and renovating their homes.”
And he writes:
“I have found DISC’s housing support service excellent. DISC manage the properties in accordance with their lease agreement, taking the responsibility of finding and vetting tenants away from the landlord and/ or the landlord’s agent
“The DISC lease ensures the rent is paid every month by BACS directly to the said landlord.”
He said his “strong recommendation” is to “engage with DISC, if you are a landlord seeking the security of a five year lease.”

DISC Housing testimonial from landlord



















Darlington Positive Support Pathway (PSP)  YMCA/DISC Partnership - Darlington SP review - August 2015
Extract taken from final report:    The service is very focused at trying to ensure that all young people, regardless of their needs and the risks they pose, are supported through the PSP and as the service embeds young people are being given every opportunity to engage in support and YMCA/DISC are effectively ‘thinking outside of the box’ to support some very challenging young people.
Overall the PSP appears to be working well and there are more opportunities for young people to engage in support.
The staff were all very passionate about the service and committed to delivering the best possible outcomes for the vulnerable young people supported.



Darlington Positive Support Pathway



















"I was unemployed with no qualifications or job references and had criminal convictions which made it difficult to find work. I heard of More Time through my brother, who was a service user and I started volunteering for More Time. 
"Within a couple of months I gained full time employment with More Time and within a year I was made Supervisor of my own team. As part of my role, I carried out renovations on many properties, where I used the skills I already had and I also learned new skills from the staff and volunteers I worked alongside.
As of April 2015 I am now employed by DISC Housing, as the Repairs & Maintenance Supervisor. As part of this role, I complete the day to day maintenance on DISC Housing’s properties and have completed full refurbs on the last of the Empty Homes properties. I have become a qualified PAT Tester and Damp Inspector and I am also planning on completing course in plastering in the near future.
Since I began working for More Time and DISC Housing, this has benefited my family and I in many ways, as I now have stable employment and a monthly wage and I am looking forward to gaining more qualifications a learning more new skills.
"I enjoyed working for More Time and now DISC Housing, it is hard work but I work as part of a team that know my skills and have the trust to allow me get on with my work on a daily basis. It’s a great team to work with."



Mark Pickard, DISC Housing



















I would say if you’re transgender and if you’re having any issues or  you’d like some support that DISC is a really good place to go for that support and the help that you would be looking for.
There 's always somebody that you can talk to about any issues and you just feel really at ease knowing that there’s somebody there to help you.
It’s helped me quite a lot. I’ve never really been confident in telling new people about things  but DISC’s really helped me to like, open up and find who I am a bit better than what I thought.”



Cauley is trans and says DISC is a “really good place to go”.



















“I was so impressed by the inspirational work carried out by the staff and volunteers at North Yorkshire Horizons.
"A number of volunteers were in recovery themselves and their bravery was humbling... there are a significant number of people of all ages in the Selby area who need help in their struggles with drug and alcohol. North Yorkshire Horizons, provides that help in spades...
"This outstanding Hub deserves our fullest support.”



North Yorkshire’s High Sheriff, Charlie Forbes Adams

DISC is fully committed to accessibility and the 2016 NHS Accessible Information Standard.  We aim to make our communications on our website and within our various projects as accessible as possible for all our stakeholders.






Home » About » Accessibility 

Our commitment to Accessibility and the new NHS Accessible Information Standard
The new browsealoud accessibility  feature on our website is part of our commitment to the NHS Accessible Information Standard.
The “launchpad” is the orange button usually found in the top right hand corner of a page. It stays with you on the screen whichever page you open.
We hope this industry-standard product will make our website – and us – more accessible to all our service users and other stakeholders.
browsealoud benefits
• It helps us make the site easily accessible to people with dyslexia, reading difficulties, visual impairments and to English Language learners
• It gives confidence to site visitors who may lack digital skills
• It complies with legal obligations for website accessibility
• It demonstrates our commitment to inclusion as well as innovation.
The DISC website is already assessed as reaching the required AA web accessibility standard. We’re sure browsealoud will now help us reach the new NHS Accessible Information Standard. Indeed, this NHS page talking about the standard itself uses browsealoud.
How to improve accessibility with browsealoud
It’s best to have a play with it to see its capabilities for yourself.
…but here’s a look at the features.
browsealoud run-through
Just click the orange button and a toolbar opens…

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Drag the toolbar to where you want it using the right hand button with arrows on it.
Features on the toolbar…

Text-to-speech with a choice of reading speeds and highlighters. Just hover over text for it to be read out aloud.
 
 
 

You can translate web pages into 78 languages. And it speaks translated text aloud in 35 languages.
 
 
 

 
The MP3 generator turns text into audio files so you can listen  offline. You can download an audio file of anything on a page or part of a page. You can then send that on to someone who may be visually impaired or prefer to get info like that.
 

 
This is the screen mask. It lets readers focus easier on the text being read. It shadows all the screen apart from the paragraph your cursor is on.
 
 

 
The on-screen text magnifier helps users with visual impairments.
 
 
The web page simplifier removes ads and other distracting content for easier reading. The page looks like a word document.
 
 
 

 
Custom settings so you can adjust, colours, magnifications and sizes to suit yourself.

Tenant Influence and Consultations


Consultations with tenants of DISC Housing has led directly to changes being made to service delivery and our documents. 






Home » Tenant Influence and Consultations 

Tenants Influence what we put in our Welcome Packs.
Several events were held  to enable our tenants to influence our Welcome Pack.  The panel of tenants phoned in to the service and gave their opinions on how phones were handled. Read more here.
We act on tenants’ phone answering recommendations
Over the course of four months, tenants undertook a Mystery Shopping exercise, related to how we answer their phone calls.  Their feedback and recommendation were presented to the Board with each recommendations being accepted and are incorporated within our service delivery. See the report.
Tenants help us choose our staff
Tenants have been a part of three recent staff recruitment interviews where they have played an active part in the selection process.
Other events have included consultations on new and reviewed documents to ensure they are appropriate for our tenants and service users.  These include consultation on our Repairs policy and guidance and our tenant involvement procedures.
Tenants’ voices embedded in our newsletter
Tenants have also been involved in the production of recent newsletters.

Understanding your teenager -sleep patterns









Home » Understanding your teenager -sleep patterns 

Yes its true! – Your teenager does need sleep to process the changes as their brains develop during adolescence.
You can help them with this – 

Make sure that you are giving them clear rules and boundaries about what time they return home in the evenings, making sure that they are going to bed to rest.
Limit their use of the internet by having a ‘cut off’ time. YOU need to take control of this yourself. They need to prove to you that they can be trusted to do this for themselves first before you allow them to self regulate.
If you can, make sure that they have their own ‘space’ or if they share a bedroom can you organise it to give them some privacy – use partitions etc.

View or Download the course info.

Understanding your teenager – power struggles









Home » Understanding your teenager – power struggles 

Learn to recognise when the conversation is becoming a power struggle – When you feel the need to ‘win’! When you are both arguing, blaming, demanding or being disrespectful.
Be clear and specific about what needs to happen and then stop talking – Say exactly what needs to happen, be clear and specific eg “You need to…(what it is)……before you go out”.
Don’t argue! – When your child starts to argue about the facts – why, when, where etc., don’t get pulled in.  Refuse to argue.
Ignore attempts to get you engaged –Tell your child that you are not going to argue about it.  Tell them you are going to ignore them if they continue to argue and engage yourself in another activity/walk away.  Separate yourself physically from your child

Understanding your teenager – choose your battles









Home » Understanding your teenager – choose your battles 

What are you arguing about?
If you have already refused before – Has anything changed since the last time they asked? You need to be consistent, if nothing has changed then the reasons for saying ‘No’ are still there!
Is it something that can be negotiated?- What are your reasons for saying ‘No’? Can your teenager give you reassurances that your concerns are unfounded? Can you meet them ‘halfway’?
Is their request reasonable?  You were a teenager once too –  recognise the times when you can be flexible.
If you need time to think about it – tell them that you need to do this and make sure you give them an answer as soon as you can.

Problems at bed time?


The key is consistency – if children have never had a bed-time before it will be difficult at first but stick with it!
Establish a routine you know you can keep to and that will work.






Home » Problems at bed time? 

The key is consistency – if children have never had a bed-time before it will be difficult at first but stick with it!
Establish a routine you know you can keep to and that will work.
Decide a time that is appropriate to the age of your child – it may sound obvious but sometimes people forget that you need to change the bedtime as children grow older!
What will your routine be? A good example may be
5:30pm – Tea-time
6:00 – 6:30pm – Quiet activities to ‘wind down’
6:30 – 7:00pm – Bath time, hair dried, use the toilet, hands washed, teeth brushed and into pyjamas.
7:00 – 7:30pm – Into bed and story time and good-night!
The rest of the evening is YOURS!!!!
Ok so that’s the ideal – what about the reality!
Your child gets up out of bed – tell them it is time for bed/to sleep, put them back into bed, kiss goodnight and then leave.
Your child gets out of bed again – take them back into bed, tuck them in and then leave.
Repeat the last step without saying anything until the child realises that you are not going to argue with them or allow them back downstairs to play.
Do this every night and your child will soon adapt to this routine. Once a good regular routine is established it will be ok on special occasions to allow your child/children to stay up a bit later as long as its only on special occasions otherwise you will be back to square one again!!!

Managing children’s behaviour


Rules and boundaries help children at any age to feel safe and loved






Home » Managing children’s behaviour 

It’s your responsibility to give them rules and they will challenge you to make sure you mean them.
When do you have problems managing your child/children’s behaviour? – Do you have problems when out in public with your child – in the shops/at the park/ when visiting friends?  How do you deal with your child when they have ‘kicked off’ in public?
Have you always had problems with your child’s behaviour?  How do you deal with your child when they ‘kick off’ at home?

Have you thought about setting ground rules before you go out with your child? If you have and its not worked have you asked yourself why? Have you given in to demands because you have felt embarrassed by your child’s behaviour? Children learn very quickly that if they persist you will give in!!
Have you tried strategies such as Time Out with your child? If you have and this has not worked have you asked yourself why? Have you given them too much time out? Have you explained why they have been given time out? Have you given in to tears and angry reactions from your child?
Consistency from an early age works wonders! Giving in to the demands of a two year old sets you up for much bigger problems where they are older! Children learn very quickly and know just what buttons to push to get their own way!
Don’t just ignore unwanted behaviour – it will not just ‘go away’ or get better in time ,it will get worse!
Be consistent, be firm but be loving, it’s the behaviour you are annoyed with, not the child!

Positive Words equals Positive Behaviour


Think about the words you use when talking to your child.






Home » Positive Words equals Positive Behaviour 

How many times a day do you praise your child/children?
What do they have to do for you to give them a cuddle?
What do they have to do for you to say ‘I love you’?
What do they have to do for you to say ‘thank-you’?
How may words can you think of to give your child praise – 5,10,20,? (btw there are at least 100 different words that can be used to give ‘praise’)
We have lots of resources at the FIP for you to use– ask your project worker how to access these.

Whether you want to admit it or not, when your receive praise – it makes you feel really good inside! It’s the same if you are a child or an adult.  It also makes you want more! There is always something that you can praise your child for every day, look for it and say it!
If you expect children to behave well – then they will. BUT if you expect children to behave negatively, then that’s what you will get. Have a positive attitude yourself and you will get a positive attitude from your child.
Try to remember a child will crave any attention that they can get and if the only time they get your attention is when they behave badly……………..well YOU need to do something about it.
Children are not mini adults – but they will use adults as their role models. Think carefully about the messages YOU are sending to your children.
Remember too that if you want your child to be polite – then you need to make sure that you are saying the words ‘please’ and ‘thank-you’ when you ask them to do something.

What do you think about reward charts?


People can have different ideas about reward charts.  There are good views and negative  views about them.






Home » What do you think about reward charts? 

What do you think?  Do they motivate or do you feel that children should  not be rewarded for things they should do anyway?
When do you think it would be appropriate to use a reward chart and what sort of reward chart?  What are appropriate rewards?
To find out more – click here to find information on the Family Links course.
We have lots of reward charts for all sorts of things – if you would like to try them speak to your project worker.

There can be reward charts for encouraging children, young people and adults for all sorts of things:
Starry Skies (Family Links)charts can be used for the whole family
Bedtime charts to encourage children to go to bed on time
Chores charts so everyone knows what they need to do
Potty/Toilet training charts
Homework charts
They can be linked to rewards and consequences
The list is endless and they can be used for a short while or for longer it all depends on why you want to use them.
You don’t have to use charts – you can use other things as well for rewards and consequences. For example using a Jar and beads.

Leeds DIP IOM Project Manager, Alison Barrie – December Blog









Home » Leeds DIP IOM Project Manager, Alison Barrie – December Blog 

A diverse workforce geared up to work with the diverse needs of service users.
By Leeds DIP IOM Project Manager, Alison Barrie.
What I’m really proud of is the diverse team that we have. The team includes paid staff, volunteers and peer mentors. Some are university graduates perhaps with psychology degrees. Some have had their own recovery journeys. Some have been involved in the criminal justice system themselves – so we have a really diverse workforce that are able to support our service users.
One of the things that I’m most proud of is how close the team are in the Leeds DIP IOM service and just the team spirit that keeps them going through quite challenging work. They work with individuals with multiple, complex needs and vulnerabilities and I guess having a workforce that’s so diverse and with different qualifications and certificates, different backgrounds means that there is a really good support system for service users at different points in the criminal justice system.
Getting past the revolving door
Some of the service users we work with have been around the criminal justice system, time and time again, they are desperate to break the cycle and find something that works. One of the biggest challenges we have is in breaking down the barriers and getting to know that person as an individual and building that rapport.
As human beings we act differently and connect differently with different people and as a worker it’s sometimes good to have a choice and to find the natural link into what motivates a person to change. Sometimes a worker can be coming from a recovery journey themselves and can link in and work differently and at different stages to a person who has maybe been trained to deliver certain interventions. But both are just as valuable and accessible in this DISC service.
We’re really proud that over 75% of the people we work with do not end up back in custody during the time that we’re Reduced re-offendingworking with them and we feel that’s a great reflection of the work that the DISC team is providing to the service users in that people are not going back into prison while they’re receiving support from the DISC team.
Service users can be with us for anything up to two years and sometimes as short as three to four weeks depending on their person need – a good average is for us to work with service users for four to six months.
We ask for feedback during and at the end of our work with individuals so we can look at if we need to change anything. Consistently, we get positive feedback about individual case managers and we’ve got lots of good examples where individuals have fed back and valued the support that their case manager has given them. I think that’s a credit to the DISC team and goes back to the diversity of the workforce and how we utilise that diversity. We try to match people to the correct worker at the correct time.
Service user involvement meetings
Part and parcel of this approach is service user involvement. We’re very keen that the service users have a voice – and actively are involved in influencing any service change and service development. We’ve established our service user group here at Mabgate and we have a once a month meeting that’s a forum for service users to be able to feedback and look at improvements. We collect service users comments – positive and not so positive – and also encourage their input to plan activities. We know that filling time satisfyingly and socialisation can be the key to somebody’s keeping on the right road. To try to prevent re-offending, we have continued with fishing and football activities and we’re hoping to continue to grow a timetable of activities that we’ve got on offer.

Step Up Into Construction – SUIC


Are you looking for a career that's going places? The Step Up Into Construction Programme could be for you! SUIC provides Work Experience, Skills Development, Health & Safety Training, CSCS Card, Employment Opportunities and Construction Training.






Home » Step Up Into Construction – SUIC 

An exciting project for the Construction industry
This is an exciting project where people can find out more about a huge range of careers available in the construction industry.
With major skills shortages and the need for up to 224,000 new jobs in the industry, now is the time to consider a career in construction.
£1million is to be invested to address the need for more skilled workers in the Yorkshire Construction Industry.
This is your chance to find out how to be a part of it.
Step Up Into Construction is a collaborative partnership set up to deliver work placements, training, further education and employment in the construction industry in Yorkshire. A grant fund of £500k from the England European Structural and Investment Funds Growth Programme (ESIF) 2014-2020 has been match funded by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) to provide a total of £1million.
How the project is designed.
The project is designed to help support a growing need to attract more potential employees from across the Leeds City Region into the construction and associated industries. This is to meet skills gaps in craft and professional occupations within the industry such as Carpenters & Joiners, Bricklayers, Plumbers, Electricians, Civil & Building Service Engineers and management expertise such as Site Supervisors, Contract Managers and Project Managers.
Mike Greener, IAG & Employer Engagement Coordinator at DISC, is excited by the new project. He said: “We’re delighted to be working in partnership with Leeds College of Building to deliver Step Up Into Construction via our Forward Leeds offices. There are some great opportunities for service users to develop skills and then gain valuable experience from the construction sector in the Leeds City Region.  There are already several employers committed to support this initiative, with a view of employing local people, and we’re confident that this project will play a major part in helping people develop the skills needed to secure employment in the construction industry.”
DISC is working with local Delivery Partners including:

Aspire-Igen
Bradford College
Calderdale College
CHY
Groundwork
Kirklees College
Leeds City College (Keighley Campus)
Leeds College of Building
Together Housing Group
Wakefield College
York College

Awareness events will be held across the Leeds City Region for participants and employers to get involved.

DISC embraces LGBT services









Home » DISC embraces LGBT services 

DISC embraces LGBT services
I transferred over to DISC around 9 years ago after working at a young people’s service in the centre of Durham called End House a fantastic resource for young people which provided everything from counselling to sexual health advice and support. My main responsibly was working with young Gay men around HIV prevention this involved running social groups and providing 1 to 1 support.
In total I have worked in the field of LGB and T for over 12 years in that time I have built up some great relationships with service users and professionals I have also seen a lot change over the years in relation to acceptance.
When I was transferred over to DISC, I was really nervous about how I would be supported in my specialist line of work. I had – and still have – real passion for my work and I needed someone to help me to develop my thoughts and ideas.
It turned out, I was to work under a brilliant manager who understood the work I was delivering – and that really helped. I can say that DISC has really embraced the LGBT service and our charity has enabled me to develop the service into what it is today.
It was tough when I came out 20 years ago – and it still is!
We have grown from delivering group and 1 to 1 support in Durham to working across the North East.
I came out when I was around 20 years old in a mining village just out of Durham and it is still as hard now for young people to come out as when it was then. I suffered from really bad depression and Anxiety thinking about how the world and how I would be accepted. No internet, no support at all in School or Durham the only thing I had in relation to not feeling alone was for those who remember a couple of Gay Characters in the soaps Beth and Margaret Brookside which at its time caused a bit of a stir with that famous kiss on the door step 22 years ago how times have past. Still in 2017 in my opinion things are better however not perfect still LGB and T people live in  the city’s to feel a sense of safety and acceptance  I have seen Durham City move on slightly with having its first Pride in 2015 which was great for the community and its villages surrounding. That’s however this is one day we need places to be accepting 24/7 people to be able to be themselves school, work, uni, community accessing services,  that’s my dream.
Lucky for me I come from a big family who have always been supportive and would protect me know matter what. Some young people who we work with have no form of support and can sometimes end up on the streets and in really desperate situations.
It’s certainly not all doom and gloom, being LGB or T and our service works on building resilience and confidence with the young people and their families.
We run peer support groups every week ,Deliver Family work ,one to one support ,educate professional, Activities and sessions in schools. We run  conferences, photography projects ,swimming, sailing, canoeing, horse riding, art campaigning, sexual health… the young people we work with are amazing.

February is LGBT History Month









Home » February is LGBT History Month 

February is LGBT History Month
5 points of important LGB and T history for me , by DISC’s LGBT services Team Leader, Billijean Summerbell.
February is LGBT History Month in the UK and its important: knowledge of any history directs political energy and shapes one’s sense of identity. So here’s a list of the 2 most important landmark moments in LGBT history in my opinion, worth educating yourself on, whatever your sexuality or gender identity:
Stonewall Riots
Riots against police raids at the Stonewall Inn in June 1969 sparked the LGBT liberation movement. The leaders of those riots were people like Marsha P Johnson, a black drag queen. Five decades on, homophobia, biphobia Transphobia is still happening.
Section 28
Legislation banning the ‘promotion’ of homosexuality in UK schools was repealed in 2003 but its legacy lives on. In 1988, it was enacted, stating that a local authority “shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality” or “promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”.
It’s hard to imagine that only 13 years ago it was repealed, I myself as a young gay woman growing up in the 80s in a mining village just outside of Durham can believe now how hard it was to come out having no positive information or role models to encourage me to feel accepted.
First Pride March in London, 1972
Around 2,000 people attended the first Pride March, held in London. It really was a massive moment in relation to standing up for the rights of L,G,B and T people. Two thousand people may not seem a lot to many. But coming out onto the streets of London in the ’70s can’t of been very easy.
 Gender Recognition Act 2004
The Gender Recognition Act 2004 is passed giving Trans people full legal recognition in their appropriate gender. The Act allows Trans people to acquire a new birth certificate, although gender options are still limited to ‘male’ or ‘female’. A massive piece of legislation to support people with legal recognition with their true gender. Great for people who want to go for the certificate however not everyone does some people may not identify as either male or female and consider themselves to be non-binary. Almost 50 years after the Beaumont society is set up there has been movement however still a long way to go in regards to services and inclusivity for trans and non-binary people all over the uk
 Equality At 2010
The Equality Act 2010 added gender reassignment as one of the specified “protected characteristics”.
The Equality Act brought together over 100 different pieces of legislation to make it clearer the different strands of discrimination which were against the law in the UK.
It provides the force of the law to protect the rights of individuals and advance equality of opportunity for all.
As well as protecting against sexual orientation, it also protects against discrimination on the grounds of gender reassignment. Other protected characteristics are age, disability, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief and sex
It’s a massive step forward in relation to legislation and protection for LGB and T people in the UK.

Success in retaining contract









Home » Success in retaining contract 

March, 2017
We were successful in retaining the contract for the new key worker service in Salford.
Since finding out in December that we maintained the contract work has been ongoing to ensure that the new service is set up to enable us to achieve the targets and outputs indicated in the contract.
Whilst delighted that the contract was retained – much of my time since has been devising and implementing the transition plan.
Not only does the contract contain some new challenges but there are also challenges around changes which are taking place in the city around the delivery of support services as a whole. This is in addition to developing a locality delivery model with an asset based approach.
My approach has to be a sensitive one when other roles may not continue in other services but at the same time ensuring that DISC are in the best position possible to deliver a continuing high quality, valued and professional service and this has been a difficult balance to maintain.
I am reassured by the strong and supportive team I have around me. Workers who are resilient, supportive and maintain their eagerness despite changes and challenges.
We have continued to deliver our high quality service and have offered our service users the opportunity to attend activities – including our Make and Create Group and a trip to Cheshire Workshops during this time.
I would not want to end this blog without acknowledging some of the key players in our success, which include:
The Salford staff team
Sophie Fox and her team
Sara Allen
Andrew Kennedy
My colleagues in the management team
And last but not least Helen Bowyer our Assistant Director
A real team effort which has brought success!!

Volunteer Development Manager, Ann Hall says:
“It’s really important that we are able to help volunteers gain valuable experience to enable them to achieve their own aspirations.
“Achieving the Investing in Volunteers accreditation in 2015 was a real highlight for me, but gaining feedback from volunteers is just as important.
“It’s extremely rewarding knowing that we at DISC have given somebody a chance to volunteer, particularly those volunteers who believe they have no experience and may once have been deemed vulnerable themselves.
“We get around 20 volunteer applications a month and this tells me we are an organisation that appeals to people. We have a happy volunteer workforce.”

#DISC2020


A clear vision for Service User employability






Home » What we do » #DISC2020 

Going the extra mile for our service users
#DISC2020 is our commitment to support 2,020 people into employment, training and volunteering by the end of the year 2020. We know that our service users not only have the potential to improve their financial situation with employment training or volunteering, but also it can improve their mental and physical health. It drives a feeling of wellbeing and improves self- worth.
Our #DISC2020 Vision
We wish to embed cross-unit working within DISC, ensuring all units work towards a common theme of supporting people into employment, training or volunteering
We know that our service users not only have the potential to improve their financial situation, with employment training or volunteering, but also it can improve their mental and physical health. It drives a feeling of well being and improves self- worth.
WOW Clubs
We intend to extend our successful WOW Club model across the North.  Watch our videos  to learn more about WOW Clubs from staff and service users.

More on the WOW Factor
The Proposal
Each DISC service unit will continue with their typical daily duties, with #DISC2020 raising the importance of employment/training/volunteering and its benefits for service users and staff.  Units will report on a regular basis the number of service users they have supported – with each unit contributing towards the overall objective of 2020 by the end of year 2020.
Moving forward the detail capture and the success for #DISC2020 can be utilised in bids and applications for funding.
How will it happen?
With the support and drive of DISC’s senior management team,  #DISC2020 will have:

Guidance to provide a framework for recording progression into employment/ training/ volunteering
Training delivered to Champions who will lead out the vision in each area
World of Work (WOW) Clubs will be rolled out in all areas. WOW clubs are facilitated by staff to support service users on their journey into employment/training/volunteering, pulling together units within DISC, via cross referrals and other more localised provision – driving cross unit working

DISC is one of the North’s most successful charities
Welcome to DISC. We help people realise their potential.  We work with them to make the most of their individual strengths and talents. We help service users identify the steps they have to take and then support them in their journey.

We have wide ranging expertise in areas like employment and skills, substance misuse, housing support, offender rehabilitation, children young people’s and families, and health and wellbeing. It allows us to offer more holistic support for service users.
We’re always innovating. And we want to break down barriers for our client groups. Over 30 years, we’ve become a trusted provider in neighbourhoods as well as on a regional scale.
Focused on our service users
Service users are at the heart of what we do. They help us to design, improve and deliver services. We trust in their experience. We support many to become volunteers, peer mentors and employees. As a charity, we’re not trying to make a profit. We’re focused on front line support.
Partnership ethos
We have a partnership ethos. We use local and specialist expertise to achieve the best outcomes for our service users. Visit our partnership page.
A growing portfolio
DISC is one of the North’s most successful home-grown charities. Although long established, we continue to grow.  In 2016/17, we hope to help even more than the 12,000 people we provided services for in the last financial year.

About


At DISC, we value the contribution of all service users, families and carers, partners, stakeholders, commissioners, volunteers and our staff.






Home » About 

DISC’s mission, vision and values
Our Vision is to support people to realise their potential and to help them become a contributing member of society.
Our Mission is to promote social inclusion.
Our Values inform everything we do.
Our Charter of Values 

Fairness  – we are committed to equality of opportunity and access for all
Integrity –  we are respectful, caring, open, honest and realistic
Safety  – we provide safe, welcoming environments for service users and staff
Quality  – we strive to deliver services that meet the highest professional standards
Effective Engagement – we are committed  to involving our staff, services users and stakeholders and local communities in the planning and development of our services to ensure services are flexible and responsive

Reducing deprivation and exclusion
For over 30 years, DISC has been committed to reducing deprivation and exclusion and to improving people’s well-being. 
DISC is now one of Northern England’s most successful home grown charities. We provide specialist services across the North East, Yorkshire and Humber  and the North West. These include substance use, clinical, employment training and education, housing support and health, young people and families services.
We offer affordable accommodation as a Registered Social Landlord via DISC Housing  and promote volunteering/employment opportunities through More Time UK DISC’s social enterprise.
About our History
DISC was first listed as a registered charity and company in 1984. We were first called Durham Training and Enterprise and focused primarily on vocational preparation programmes for the young, long-term unemployed in County Durham.
In the late 1980s, we began working with youth and adult offenders.
DISC then led the development of innovative services for people who were homeless through the establishment of ‘accommodation registers’ and independent living support for care leavers.
In 1992, to reflect our broadening footprint, we changed our name to DISC – Developing Initiatives for Support in the Community.

Drugs warning









Home » Drugs warning 

As you may be aware, since Friday 14th April 2017 on Friday 14th April there have been a number of reported deaths, suspected to be resulting from heroin use in Barnsley.  As yet, we are currently awaiting confirmation of whether this resulted from the strength or content of the drug, but we will communicate this as soon as this information is available.
Any death from drug use is a tragedy, and DISC offers its condolences to all involved.
Drug users and their friends and families need to be aware that the strength of heroin is only one of a number of factors that can lead to an overdose. People can become less tolerant to heroin after a period of abstinence, and using the drug at the same time as other depressant drugs, including alcohol, all contribute to the risk. Age, depression and having recently experienced another overdose can also increase the risk.
Heroin addiction is a chronic relapsing condition and can take many years and several attempts at treatment to overcome. But we should never write people off – with the right support and treatment, they can and do recover. DISC provide excellent services and support is available for anybody who wants to overcome addiction.
We advise current heroin users to use a smaller test dose with any new batches, don’t use depressants at the same time as heroin, and don’t use alone. If somebody overdoses on heroin, or experiences any unusual symptoms, an ambulance should be called immediately and any available naloxone used.

BRiCWorks Hull supports the community
BRiCWorks Hull, which is on Story Street, is a community hub funded by the BIG Lottery’s Reaching Communities initiative.
The hub successfully help people and communities most in need, providing support, friendship and a place to go. At its heart is a cafe which serves good quality food and hot and soft drinks at low prices. The kitchen offers local people outside catering for weddings, christenings, funeral teas and other events. It also provides  catering for  Wates construction sites in the city.

The community hub provides a range of activities and opportunities that supports and encourages participation, and are aimed at improving people’s health and well-being and increasing access to social networks etc.
Our roots are firmly in the recovery community and we provide real support to people in recovery from substance misuse to overcome issues around their mental/emotional health, provide support to those who feel isolated or struggling with other barriers preventing them to lead a fuller life.
The hub is also now a delivery partner for Humber’s Recovery and Wellbeing College which delivers educational courses and workshops.

Home » Projects » Horizon Durham Young Adult Carers



Horizon Durham Young Adult Carers
Horizon Durham Young Adult Carers provides transition support for young adult carers, between the ages of 14 and 25, and to their families.
We help empower young adult carers to be heard, access services, gain confidence, have choices and enjoy life.
Giving carers a break
The Cornforth Partnership provides a free help line for young people who may find themselves within a caring role and are unsure about what support they can access. The YMCA provides activities for the young people to engage in to give them a break from their caring role and to meet other young carers.
The service offers a variety of support to the young people and their families;

1-2-1 Support – with a project worker to talk about the impact of their caring role, to discuss future aspirations and develop an action plan based on assessed needs.
Group Work – this offers the young person the opportunity to meet other young people alike and share skills and experiences around being a carer. The group work often involves the young people meeting professional services that can offer additional support or training. The young people take part in leisure activities and get involved in planning future events.
Family Work– this is an additional service offered to the young adult carer that feels like the whole family could benefit from extra support. An appointed family worker will work alongside the family to offer support around current issues, benefit entitlement, access to services, family group work and activates.
Group Forums– regular forums built around the young adult carers were they can share an opportunity to become involved in decision making and developing current and future services.
Peer Mentoring– in-house training offered to the young adult carer to support further development skills and service involvement
Volunteering– Horizon offer volunteering opportunities to the young adult carer to help them gain skills and experience to develop their career pathway and to develop confidence.
Job Club workshop service– offering young adult carers the opportunity to develop employability skills and experience, job search, CV writing, interview techniques and a wide range of skills.
College Drop In’s– Drop In service working alongside a wide range of colleges, universities and One Point Service within Durham and Darlington.
Funding Opportunities- Horizon will support the young person in accessing and applying to support their caring role.
Open Referral Service- Horizon offer an open referral service were the individual can self-refer either by phone, email or post. Referrals can be made by family members or professionals working with the family or individual.

Rainbow Flag Award


Funded by the Government Equalities Office, via the Department for Education






 
Home » Projects » Rainbow Flag Award



The Rainbow Flag Award is a quality assurance framework for schools, primary and secondary. Through a process of self assessment and ongoing monitoring and feedback, schools will determine how well they are providing safe and supportive environments for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) students, taking a whole school approach. The award will focus on six key areas:
Red– Skilled Teachers
Orange – Supportive Governors and Parents
Yellow – Effective Policies
Green – Inclusive Curriculum
Blue – Pastoral Support
Violet – Pupil Voice
Schools are encouraged to implement change and make improvements in each area where individual colour badges are available, with a full Rainbow Flag Award badge being presented upon satisfactory standards being met in all areas. DISC will support 54 schools to achieve the award contributing to our partnership total of 250.
The project is led by The Proud Trust, Manchester in conjunction with our other national partners Allsorts Youth Project, Sussex and the Kite Trust, Cambridgeshire.

Leeds Offender Support Services


Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) Throughcare and Aftercare services and Integrated Offender Management Functions






 
Home » Projects » Leeds Offender Support Services



Successful work since 2008
Leeds Offender support services has provided successful Drug Interventions Programme (DIP), Throughcare and Aftercare services and Integrated Offender Management (IOM) functions since 2008. We work alongside Police, Probation, Prisons, Courts and other criminal justice services.
Tackling re-offending
The Integrated Offender Management (IOM) programme provides support to recognised problematic offenders or Priority Prolific Offenders or those deemed to be at risk of offending. DISC work with individuals and their families to enable them to:

reduce their offending,
access and maintain accommodation,
increase their independence,
strengthen family relationships,
encourage good parenting,
raise awareness of rights and responsibilities,
access opportunities and increase community integration.

Leeds Offender support services works with other Offender Management agencies to provide support for up to 2 years. We work at times and locations to meet service users’ needs, including assertive outreach.






Working closely with statutory organisations
Our Drug Intervention Programme, provides Offender Management and Recovery focused services to reduce crime and substance misuse. DISC work in close partnership with Forward Leeds, the Prison Service, Drug and Alcohol Recovery Services within prisons ( DARS ), Police, Arrest Referral, Courts and Probation to deliver a high quality and coordinated services. We help adults leaving prison to maintain a drug free status and integrate successfully back into the local community. Referrals are via DARS and Police.

 Case Studies and testimonials
project volunteer looks forward to her work   Volunteer – service is a big help
Senior practitioner – we improve the mindset   Creating opportunities for socialisation and relaxation








Prisons work
A core part of the work is Through Care and Aftercare services around release from prison. We work with people while they’re still in prison. A lot of the people we get referred have got 12 weeks or fewer to go before their release date.
We form support plans with individuals and these plans focus around treatment needs,  support to find and sustain suitable accommodation, physical health needs such as GPs, hospital follow-ups, mental health screening. (We are trained to carry out the screening. This means case managers are able to signpost the appropriate mental health services in the city at the earliest opportunity.)


Employment, Training and Education
We support people to look at opportunities and their options around employment, education and training. This may include peer mentoring and volunteering.
Safeguarding
At Leeds’ Front Door Safeguarding Hub’s daily meetings in Westgate, DISC is involved in reviewing the previous 24 hours’ works in partnership with other agencies to formulate support packages and plans for individual cases that have involved domestic abuse.
Please read the Leeds City Council’s One Minute guide on the Front Door Safeguarding Hub.
One Minute Guide – Daily Domestic Violence Meeting
It is an experts’ group and we provide advice and prioritise actions about individual cases. We offer perpetrators appropriate support and advice based on the individual’s support needs. This can look at behaviour change, coping strategies, anger management as well as support and advice for substance use, accommodation and Employment, Education and Training options.
Out of Court Disposals (Conditional Cautions)
In 2014, West Yorkshire Police were selected to take part in a national pilot scheme related to the wider issue of Out of Court Disposals (OoCDs). This commenced in Leeds District on Monday 24th November 2014.
This is a disposal which enables police officers to deal with low-level offending outside of the formal court system, for cases which would be suitable for prosecution but where the public interest is better served by the offender complying with suitable conditions.
In Leeds if someone is issued with a conditional caution they are required to attend 3 appointments. DISC staff can assess and identify appropriate support and provide interventions which will reduce the risk of the individual reoffending.
Attendance rates are extremely high – 85%.

Accident and Emergency Alcohol link worker


Alcohol advice and help to people admitted to the Accident & Emergency (A&E) Department.






 
Home » Projects » Accident and Emergency Alcohol link worker



Accident and Emergency Alcohol link worker
DISC and Scarborough General Hospital are working in partnership to offer alcohol advice and brief interventions to individuals admitted to the Accident & Emergency (A&E) Department.
More informed decisions
The interventions are aimed at helping people make more informed decisions about
how much alcohol they drink and reducing the harm of alcohol on themselves and
others. The project aims to help people to access relevant support services and aims to
reduce the number of re-admissions to hospital associated with alcohol use.
The (A&E) Accident and Emergency Alcohol Worker aims to see patients referred by A&E staff within 24 hours of accessing the A&E department and offers a 3 session Brief Intervention which includes brief advice including assessment, education, harm reduction and motivational work. People who need further help are advised about treatment options that are available within the community and referrals into these services are made.
Based in Scarborough Hospital
The A&E Alcohol Worker is based within the A&E department and can see patients for each of the three sessions on-site, on a hospital ward, at the Women’s Community Project offices in Scarborough, Whitby or Ryedale, in the community or in their own homes.
Information packs
Information packs are available from the A&E department for anyone who wants to learn more about alcohol, how it can affect people’s health and their behaviour, and about the help and support available within the community.

Challenging Youth Racism


Designed to encourage community cohesion across multi-ethnic communities within the North East






 
Home » Projects » Challenging Youth Racism














Challenging Youth Racism
Working in partnership with Teesside University and funded via the Big Lottery Reaching Communities initiative, our innovative programme is designed to encourage community cohesion across multi-ethnic communities across the North East.
Hate crime can be hugely damaging for the victim, we provide education and support to reduce hate crime and the prevalence of youth racism in the North East. We will work in both a universal and targeted manner with young people across the area to;

identify key factors and influences which lead young people to adopt intolerant attitudes
target young people/localities who display racist or intolerant attitudes to ethnic minority groups
address fears and challenge misconceptions whilst sharing knowledge and understanding of other cultures
reduce hate crime, promote ethnic and religious tolerance, cooperation and the benefits of diverse communities

If you would like our experienced team to deliver an awareness session within your school, community group, youth club or similar environment please get in touch.
We are also seeking representation from BME groups on our management committee and would welcome any interested applicants.

Leeds Offender Support Services


Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) Throughcare and Aftercare services and Integrated Offender Management Functions






 
Home » Projects » Leeds Offender Support Services



Successful work since 2008
Leeds Offender support services has provided successful Drug Interventions Programme (DIP), Throughcare and Aftercare services and Integrated Offender Management (IOM) functions since 2008. We work alongside Police, Probation, Prisons, Courts and other criminal justice services.
Tackling re-offending
The Integrated Offender Management (IOM) programme provides support to recognised problematic offenders or Priority Prolific Offenders or those deemed to be at risk of offending. DISC work with individuals and their families to enable them to:

reduce their offending,
access and maintain accommodation,
increase their independence,
strengthen family relationships,
encourage good parenting,
raise awareness of rights and responsibilities,
access opportunities and increase community integration.

Leeds Offender support services works with other Offender Management agencies to provide support for up to 2 years. We work at times and locations to meet service users’ needs, including assertive outreach.
Working closely with statutory organisations
Our Drug Intervention Programme, provides Offender Management and Recovery focused services to reduce crime and substance misuse. DISC work in close partnership with Forward Leeds, the Prison Service, Drug and Alcohol Recovery Services within prisons ( DARS ), Police, Arrest Referral, Courts and Probation to deliver a high quality and coordinated services. We help adults leaving prison to maintain a drug free status and integrate successfully back into the local community. Referrals are via DARS and Probation Service.
Case Studies and testimonials
project volunteer looks forward to her work   Volunteer – service is a big help
Senior practitioner – we improve the mindset
Prisons work
A core part of the work is Through Care and Aftercare services around release from prison. We work with people while they’re still in prison. A lot of the people we get referred have got 12 weeks or fewer to go before their release date.
We form support plans with individuals and these plans focus around treatment needs,  support to find and sustain suitable accommodation, physical health needs such as GPs, hospital follow-ups, mental health screening. (We are trained to carry out the screening. This means case managers are able to signpost the appropriate mental health services in the city at the earliest opportunity.)
Employment, Training and Education
We support people to look at opportunities and their options around employment, education and training. This may include peer mentoring and volunteering.
Safeguarding
At Leeds’ Front Door Safeguarding Hub’s daily meetings in Westgate, DISC is involved in reviewing the previous 24 hours’ works in partnership with other agencies to formulate support packages and plans for individual cases that have involved domestic abuse.
Please read the Leeds City Council’s One Minute guide on the Front Door Safeguarding Hub.
It is an experts’ group and we provide advice and prioritise actions about individual cases. We offer perpetrators appropriate support and advice based on the individual’s support needs. This can look at behaviour change, coping strategies, anger management as well as support and advice for substance use, accommodation and Employment, Education and Training options.
Out of Court Disposals (conditional Cautions)
In 2014, West Yorkshire Police were selected to take part in a national pilot scheme related to the wider issue of Out of Court Disposals (OoCDs). This commenced in Leeds District on Monday 24th November 2014.
This is a disposal which enables police officers to deal with low-level offending outside of the formal court system, for cases which would be suitable for prosecution but where the public interest is better served by the offender complying with suitable conditions.
In Leeds if someone is issued with a conditional caution they are required to attend 3 appointments. DISC staff can assess and identify appropriate support and provide interventions which will reduce the risk of the individual reoffending.
Attendance rates are extremely high – 85%.

Action Towards Inclusion


Action Towards Inclusion North Yorkshire, DISC are a sub contractor to Your Consortium






 
Home » Projects » Action Towards Inclusion




Building Better Opportunities (BBO) brings together funding from the Big Lottery Fund and the European Social Fund (ESF) to help tackle the poverty and social exclusion faced by the most disadvantaged people in England. By joining up with ESF, the BBO programme will double the impact of Big Lottery money at a local level and offer a route to European funding for organisations that may have found it difficult to access it in the past.
Action Towards Inclusion is the name of the project taking place in the York, North Yorkshire and East Riding Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) area.
This project aims to provide support to the most disadvantaged groups in the YNYER LEP area who are furthest from the labour market and who experience significant barriers to work. It will provide support for these people to address barriers to work and tackle the disadvantages they face, helping them move towards job search, education or training and employment.
The project will achieve this by engaging these priority ‘hard to reach’ groups and providing them with support to move closer towards the labour market. This will include support to overcome barriers related to health, finances and skills.
Furthermore, the project aims to address the root causes of poverty that create barriers to work, to enable those who are socially excluded to move closer towards and into employment.
DISC are a Key Worker organisation within the partnership, delivering in Selby, Scarborough and Harrogate.  Key Workers will provide mentoring for participants and will be the first point of access and main support-giver to participants throughout their journey on the Action Towards Inclusion programme. They will help participants to overcome their barriers and move closer towards job-search, education, training and employment.
We will support 116 participants to December 2018.

Darlington Intensive Mental Health Floating Support and Housing Advice


Housing support for people with complex mental health needs






 
Home » Projects » Darlington Intensive Mental Health Floating Support and Housing Advice



Darlington Intensive Mental Health Floating Support & Housing Advice Service
Floating Support is delivered in your own home by a dedicated Support Worker. Support can help you to live independently or to settle into stable accommodation and is structured around the following areas:
Economic Wellbeing
Support is provided to help you maximise your income, ensure you receive the correct welfare benefits, and advise you on reducing debt and how to obtain paid work.
Enjoy and Achieve
We support you to participate in training/education, to access leisure activities, cultural or faith groups: how to volunteer or secure work experience posts, and can provide help with contact for external services, friends or family.
Better Health
We support you to better manage your physical and mental health, along with any substance misuse issues you may have. We ensure assistive technology/aids/adaptations are in place.
Stay Safe
Helping you to maintain accommodation and to avoid eviction, resettlement into a new home and giving advice on how to secure utilities and furniture. We also help you to understand the rights and responsibilities of being a tenant. Advice can be provided around offending behaviour, resolving neighbourhood disputes and harassment.
Making a Positive Contribution
Supporting you to develop confidence and ability to have a greater choice and/or control and helping your participation in the local community.
Meaningful Activities Programme
Delivering a programme of activities to help you maintain an active lifestyle, including an allotment programme, arts & crafts groups and cooking instruction.
Floating Support does not include:
Meal preparation and regular assistance to cook meals. Personal hygiene such as using the toilet, washing, bathing, shaving. Shopping or accompanying on shopping trips on a regular basis. Specialist counselling. Undertaking repairs and home improvement
To access support you need to be:
Aged over 16 or over and living in Darlington and have complex mental health problems diagnosed by a suitably qualified practitioner. You must also be in need of intensive housing related support (7-10 hours per week). You’ll also have direct housing responsibilities or be actively seeking accommodation.
How to access Floating Support:
Asking an agency who you’re working with to complete a Referral Form on your behalf. Contacting the office and we will complete a Referral Form with you.
What happens next?
All referrals are processed via our Gateway. An initial assessment will be arranged with a Support Worker to discuss your needs further and confirm your eligibility. If suitable, the Gateway Coordinator will place you on the waiting list; anyone requiring crisis help such as prevention of eviction proceedings or about to be discharged from hospital will be prioritised.
When a place is available a Support Worker will be allocated who will contact you to arrange a visit; this will be confirmed in writing. The visit is to discuss your needs in further detail to develop a Support Plan. If we are unable to provide support we will contact you explaining why and look at alternative forms of support; this will be confirmed in writing. We will advise how you can appeal against this decision.
Your Support Plan will incorporate any support provided by other agencies. We will review the plan with you on a regular basis but you can request a review at any time. When agreed goals on your Support Plan have been achieved, you will plan the withdrawal of support with your Support Worker.
At exit from the scheme you will receive written confirmation that your support has ended but you have a right to appeal against this if you disagree. Should you need assistance in the future, we would welcome your application.
Your Rights and Responsibilities
These will be explained in further detail when your support starts but to summarise you have a right to:
Confidentiality             Information                  Fair Treatment
Representation            Be Consulted              Make a Complaint
We would ask that you meet your Support Worker on a regular basis to work on your Support Plan, informing them in advance if you are unable to meet as arranged. We also ask that you treat them fairly and with dignity and respect.
Drop-in opening hours:
10am – 4pm Monday – Friday

Moving On Tyne & Wear (MOTW) brings together a partnership of 17 well respected, specialist, voluntary, public and private sector organisations, with a proven track record of delivering health, wellbeing, training and employment support to people experiencing a range of health issues and complex needs. All our partners are committed to making a real difference to make lasting and positive change to the lives of 1,620 people in Tyne & Wear, whose primary barrier to employment is a health issue. The programme is led by Mental Health Concern.
We will achieve this by providing one-to-one intensive support that encourages and supports people to address their health issues, and achieve their goals, alongside five innovation projects testing new approaches to supporting specific participant groups to improve their employability. Overall the support provided by MOTW will help all our participants to progress towards and into education, training, job search and employment.
The programme is delivered across the 5 local authority areas that make up the Tyne and Wear area: Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland, commencing 1st April 2017- 30th September 2019.
Over a three year delivery period, Moving on Tyne & Wear will engage with and support 1,620 unemployed or economically inactive residents of Tyne & Wear with complex needs.

Step Up Into Construction – SUIC


Are you looking for a career that's going places? The Step Up Into Construction Programme could be for you! SUIC provides Work Experience, Skills Development, Health & Safety Training, CSCS Card, Employment Opportunities and Construction Training.






 
Home » Projects » Step Up Into Construction – SUIC





An exciting project for the Construction industry
This is an exciting project where people can find out more about a huge range of careers available in the construction industry.
With major skills shortages and the need for up to 224,000 new jobs in the industry, now is the time to consider a career in construction.
£1million is to be invested to address the need for more skilled workers in the Yorkshire Construction Industry.
This is your chance to find out how to be a part of it.
Step Up Into Construction is a collaborative partnership set up to deliver work placements, training, further education and employment in the construction industry in Yorkshire. A grant fund of £500k from the England European Structural and Investment Funds Growth Programme (ESIF) 2014-2020 has been match funded by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) to provide a total of £1million.
How the project is designed.
The project is designed to help support a growing need to attract more potential employees from across the Leeds City Region into the construction and associated industries. This is to meet skills gaps in craft and professional occupations within the industry such as Carpenters & Joiners, Bricklayers, Plumbers, Electricians, Civil & Building Service Engineers and management expertise such as Site Supervisors, Contract Managers and Project Managers.
A DISC project spokesperson said: “We’re delighted to be working in partnership with Leeds College of Building to deliver Step Up Into Construction via our Forward Leeds offices. There are some great opportunities for service users to develop skills and then gain valuable experience from the construction sector in the Leeds City Region.  There are already several employers committed to support this initiative, with a view of employing local people, and we’re confident that this project will play a major part in helping people develop the skills needed to secure employment in the construction industry.”
DISC is working with local Delivery Partners including:

Aspire-Igen
Bradford College
Calderdale College
CHY
Groundwork
Kirklees College
Leeds City College (Keighley Campus)
Leeds College of Building
Together Housing Group
Wakefield College
York College

Awareness events will be held across the Leeds City Region for participants and employers to get involved.

The scheme offers a range of accommodation, outreach, assessment and advice as well as co-ordinating the delivery of the Cold Weather provision for rough sleepers in Bradford.
Discovery House provides short term emergency accommodation in circumstances where an immediate housing solution cannot be provided. We provide

7 beds for clients with no recourse to public funds (2 beds dedicated for females)
An additional 10 ‘sit-up’ spaces during cold weather
24/7 staffed supported accommodation 365 nights per year

We are committed to ensuring accessibility to our service and can receive referrals by phone, fax, online, in person or through the national ‘Streetlink’ service.
Our Achievements

In 2016-17, Discovery House offered accommodation to 280 clients including 96 people who had no recourse to public funds.
Of these, 163 clients (69%) moved on in a ‘planned way’ into more permanent accommodation, including accommodation provided by DISC’s own RSL ‘DISC Housing’

The service will respond to referrals within 24 hours and ensure a rapid response to the support needs of the individual. The service will provide support to help you:

remain in your own home, or
access emergency supported accommodation,
set up and secure longer term housing, or,
reconnect to your home area.

DISC delivers Bradford No Second Night Out and works together with other local providers and Bradford City Council.

Home » Projects » North Yorkshire Horizons

We provide support to to enable as many people as possible recover from drug and alcohol dependency in North Yorkshire and to reduce the harms caused by drug and alcohol misuse to both individuals and communities.

 
The service operates from 5 main hubs across North Yorkshire in:

Northallerton
Selby
Harrogate
Scarborough
Skipton

Local access in rural areas is provided via community venues.

Support for over 18s
Support is available to anyone over 18 who misuses drugs and/or anyone who is a harmful or dependent drinker. There is also an emphasis on the problems caused by the increasing availability of legal highs and psychoactive substances.
Peer mentors
North Yorkshire Horizons offers opportunities for those in recovery to become involved as peer mentors so they can help others in treatment. We give encouragement and support to individuals to make the first steps to recovery and we are there as a support during ongoing recovery when abstinent.
A visible and vibrant recovery community
We really want the people who use our service to feel they are part of a visible and vibrant recovery community. We have set it up so people are inspired and support each other through their problems to successfully reintegrate back into communities.
 
Central to the service is a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) telephone number 01723 330 730 where information, advice, support and access to the service can be obtained to individuals and their families, no matter where you live in the county.
Self-referrals welcome
Referrals can be made through the SPOC where an initial assessment can be undertaken and appointments made to see one of our clinical or recovery staff. Referral forms can be obtained from the SPOC or downloaded from the North Yorkshire website or from any of the Hubs.  Self-referrals are welcome and can be made at any of the hubs or by phoning the SPOC.
The service is a partnership of DISC, Spectrum Medical, Lifeline and Changing Lives
A recent independent report written by Liverpool John Moores University delivers a really positive commentary on the ability of the service to help its clients. You can read the report by clicking on the link:

Families with children under 16 years who are experiencing difficulties maintaining their tenancy/or losing their homes as a result of anti-social behaviour or debt can access the service. We provide intensive parenting and family support.
We support families facing other difficulties, such as:

Poor school attendance
Accessing out of work benefits.
Poor family functioning. Domestic abuse, substance misuse, long term health conditions, parents’ offending or in prison, parental mental health, learning disabilities.

Individual Family Action Plans
Specialist family workers complete comprehensive assessments of a family’s strengths and difficulties and put in place an individual action plan to:

Reduce Anti-social behaviour, providing support to those classed as a perpetrator or as a victim.
Access training or work.
Improve children’s school attendance
Better manage children’s behaviour
Manage debts, benefits and/or housing issues

Family Action Plans are reviewed regularly, along with other statutory services engaged with families, to ensure we can support the needs of the whole family as long as is needed, usually between 4- 15 months.
We also encourage everyone to get involved in the development of the project through a dedicated Service Users Group (SUGAR).
We support families to turn their lives around.

I would say if you’re transgender and if you’re having any issues or  you’d like some support that DISC is a really good place to go for that support and the help that you would be looking for.
There 's always somebody that you can talk to about any issues and you just feel really at ease knowing that there’s somebody there to help you.
It’s helped me quite a lot. I’ve never really been confident in telling new people about things  but DISC’s really helped me to like, open up and find who I am a bit better than what I thought.”

DISC Housing
Employment, Training & Education
Social Enterprise


"I was unemployed with no qualifications or job references and had criminal convictions which made it difficult to find work. I heard of More Time through my brother, who was a service user and I started volunteering for More Time. 
"Within a couple of months I gained full time employment with More Time and within a year I was made Supervisor of my own team. As part of my role, I carried out renovations on many properties, where I used the skills I already had and I also learned new skills from the staff and volunteers I worked alongside.
As of April 2015 I am now employed by DISC Housing, as the Repairs & Maintenance Supervisor. As part of this role, I complete the day to day maintenance on DISC Housing’s properties and have completed full refurbs on the last of the Empty Homes properties. I have become a qualified PAT Tester and Damp Inspector and I am also planning on completing course in plastering in the near future.
Since I began working for More Time and DISC Housing, this has benefited my family and I in many ways, as I now have stable employment and a monthly wage and I am looking forward to gaining more qualifications a learning more new skills.
"I enjoyed working for More Time and now DISC Housing, it is hard work but I work as part of a team that know my skills and have the trust to allow me get on with my work on a daily basis. It’s a great team to work with."

Alcohol & Drug Treatment


“I was so impressed by the inspirational work carried out by the staff and volunteers at North Yorkshire Horizons.
"A number of volunteers were in recovery themselves and their bravery was humbling... there are a significant number of people of all ages in the Selby area who need help in their struggles with drug and alcohol. North Yorkshire Horizons, provides that help in spades...
"This outstanding Hub deserves our fullest support.”

DISC Housing testimonial from landlord







 
Home » Testimonials » DISC Housing testimonial from landlord





								Thursday 10th March 2016							


DISC Housing


“As a landlord, I am very pleased with DISC’s Housing Service, as it offers landlords and people in need, support with relevant professional help.
“DISC works with private landlords and helps tenants who would otherwise find it hard to seek a home to live in and tenants are supported through the entire process of their rehabilitation.”
Mr Mitchell lists a series of “benefits of a DISC lease as a private landlord", including…
“All clients are risk assessed to ensure they are safe to be in the community and are not a risk to others in the community.
“DISC’s private landlords are paid monthly and the landlords’ responsibility is passed to DISC in accordance with the lease agreement.
“Many landlords prior to partnering with DISC would have been unable to afford the cost of repairing and renovating their homes.”
And he writes:
“I have found DISC’s housing support service excellent. DISC manage the properties in accordance with their lease agreement, taking the responsibility of finding and vetting tenants away from the landlord and/ or the landlord’s agent
“The DISC lease ensures the rent is paid every month by BACS directly to the said landlord.”
He said his “strong recommendation” is to “engage with DISC, if you are a landlord seeking the security of a five year lease.”

DISC Peer Mentoring course testimonials

								Thursday 10th March 2016							


Volunteering


Peer Mentor ref PJPM1230216
"Coming towards the end of the six week peer mentoring course with mixed emotions really, I will actually miss the course and all the people doing it with me (great group). Although, on the other hand pleased I have finally completed the course as I have been waiting a while for a peer mentoring course to start.
"The group work has been really good as it has made the learning very interesting and I always think it’s great to learn from each other. The teaching of the course has been brilliant, all very clear and at a nice place to learn.
  "The role of peer mentor is definitely for me as I feel I have a valuable range of life experience to share when needed.  Group work is something I sued to fear but now with the practice gained from the course I am able to get involved in a confident manner. All in all great course and something I am very passionate about moving forward in my own recovery journey. The course has been extremely useful for me and the skills learnt I will take with me into a role hopefully full time at some point.
  "We went into policies including health and safety, equal opportunities and confidentiality. This gave me an insight into where and who to go to if I have problems in the workplace."
Peer Mentor ref CDPM1230216
"I have found the peer mentoring course very interesting and it has been something I have wanted to pursue for some time now. We did a scenario on communication skills this really helped me to grow in confidence as I know in the past I would have struggled with things like that. Since doing each session of peer mentor training, I can feel my self-worth, my strengths and hopes for the future growing.
  "The first session helped me to consolidate my understanding of the role. Session six was an invaluable session, I have come away knowing that my current strengths are mainly based on a personal basis."
Peer Mentor ref CDPM1230216
"I was keen to learn from this course how to be both professional and supportive as well as actually how to support a service user to make focused, practical changes in their lives. I am good at building rapport and breaking the ice but the session on active listening and the many forms of communication one can use in a mentor/mentee relationship was really valuable to me."
Peer Mentor ref BRPM1230216
"I have learnt a lot on this course and have become a lot more knowledgeable about the role of a peer mentor. I have gained great knowledge on signposting from not living in the area long, I knew of very few services but attending this course has shown me there are lots of different services and education available. The teaching methods have been made very clear and make sure everyone understands them before moving on to another topic.
Peer Mentor ref SRPM1230216
"The peer mentoring course has been both interesting and informative in all its aspects. The course has provided guidelines for the health and safety for all concerned and clearly defined the boundaries for the mentor.
   "Hypothetical scenarios have been useful in illustrating how a mentor/mentee relationship may play out and has been valuable in showing possible problems which may arise, they have also helped how to put into practice what has been learnt. I have enjoyed my time on the course. It has been made clear that any questions or problems that may arise can be referred to supervisors or key workers for clarity."
Peer Mentor ref PKPM1230216
"Loved it and learnt so much."
Peer Mentor ref DDPM1230216
"I’ve learnt a lot during this course and will be happy to further my skills in the substance misuse area as a peer mentor. I will be trying to show people how my experiences led me to the place I’m  at now, I’m diverse I’m understanding and empathetic.
"I’m looking forward to furthering my education and qualifications so that in the near future I will achieve my goal of becoming a drug worker or something similar.
Peer Mentor ref DTPM1230216
"Before starting the peer mentoring course I was very anxious and nervous. Since starting the group sessions I have felt supported by the tutor and the group. My confidence has grown and I feel more able to use my voice. I just feel I want to give something back as a peer mentor supporting others that are going through what I’ve been through."
  Full details of these peer mentors retained on file.

Housing Support


Darlington Positive Support Pathway (PSP)  YMCA/DISC Partnership - Darlington SP review - August 2015
Extract taken from final report:    The service is very focused at trying to ensure that all young people, regardless of their needs and the risks they pose, are supported through the PSP and as the service embeds young people are being given every opportunity to engage in support and YMCA/DISC are effectively ‘thinking outside of the box’ to support some very challenging young people.
Overall the PSP appears to be working well and there are more opportunities for young people to engage in support.
The staff were all very passionate about the service and committed to delivering the best possible outcomes for the vulnerable young people supported.

Volunteering


"I was keen to learn from this course how to be both professional and supportive as well as actually how to support a service user to make focused, practical changes in their lives. I am good at building rapport and breaking the ice but the session on active listening and the many forms of communication one can use in a mentor/mentee relationship was really valuable to me."

Criminal Justice


Steve Littlewood – Senior practitioner & support worker for Leeds DIP IOM
We do lots of things to improve the mind-set. The reason I work for Disc is because I like working with people. We deal with people. They’re not units, they’re not statistics; they’re people.
If we didn’t support people in their recovery, in their journey to getting a meaningful life, the numbers of those needing help would be greater and there would be little other support.
People with a lot of complex needs tend to slip through the cracks. We provide a safe place for them here, we do a lot of outreach and we provide them, sometimes, with a reason to get up in the morning.
If you didn’t have organisations like Disc you would have a lot more people in and out of prison and using drugs; it’s a cycle. We help people maintain stability and help them try to live as much of an ordinary life as possible.

Volunteering


I’ve been volunteering for 2 years now. I think the work that Disc does is important because we help service users with things like housing, benefits, even basic necessities like food and helping them to pay bills and with all normal aspects of life. For our service users at DIP/ IOM especially because some of them have just recently come out of prison, so that’s a big help for them and you can really see that they appreciate it.

Women, Criminal Justice and Community



We deliver services for women offenders, those with complex needs, substance misusers, street drinkers, children, vulnerable women, rough sleepers.





 
Home » Services » Women, Criminal Justice and Community


Women, Criminal Justice and Community
We deliver services for women offenders, those with complex needs, substance misuse, street drinkers, children, vulnerable women, rough sleepers and work in a number of community settings like A&E and in people’s homes.
The service came about following a merger in February 2016 of DISC with the The Cambridge Centre, based in Scarborough.
Women’s Community Project
In the Women’s Community Project , we work with women in the criminal justice system and provide a viable alternative to custody in order to prevent the displacement of families and prevent lasting damage to children because of their mother’s imprisonment.
Gender specific setting
The women serve their community order (Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and unpaid work) within a gender specific setting.
The service provides a range of interventions to reduce a woman’s offending around specific areas: thinking skills and behaviour change, substance misuse, domestic violence, children and families, finance and debt management, education and training, sexual exploitation and trauma.
Breaking through
We provide a crèche which breaks through the most significant barrier to women accessing their appointments. At the same, time, it provides a fantastic learning environment for children in vulnerable families and provides invaluable support to mothers to enable them to enjoy the benefits of positive parenting.
We work closely with children’s centres and Children’s Social Care to ensure women and families receive the full support available to them.
 
The service also offers

 Intensive Supported Housing Project and floating support for the most complex and chaotic individuals in the locality.
A&E alcohol screening and brief intervention
Miss Elainey’s a social enterprise providing a working environment for women to increase employment skills, training and confidence.
Work with people in the community to prevent eviction
Community engagement
Work with offenders regarding their use of new-psychoactive substances
Awareness raising in education settings regarding New-Psychoactive Substances

DISC’s Health and Wellbeing projects are regularly recommissioned. We’ve been delivering support and clinical intervention services for children, young people and adults for many years.
We help…

Adults with learning disabilities
Advocacy
Young people whose lives are effected by substance misuse
Young people in secure unit settings

Working in partnerships for our service users
Health and well-being services are usually commissioned by councils and we work very closely with them. DISC works closely. We develop and pilot new models of intervention.
We regularly work in partnership and consortium models.  It’s the way we do things across our charity work. and it means that we can draw on expertise and experience, often local experience to address the different, individual needs of our service users.
We take what’s known as an “asset-based” approach. We draw upon people’s strengths, their aspirations, their relationships within the community to achieve lasting resilience and outcomes.

Psycho-social interventions
DISC uses different psycho-social intervention methods and models. They may include motivational interviewing, cognitive behaviour therapy and neuro-linguistic programming. Systemic families therapy model is used across our services.
Along with our asset-based approach to delivery, we maximise the benefits of  our health and wellbeing services. Service users feel more empowered. They feel more a part of the community. We’ve seen their self-esteem rise. We’re able to strengthen all-important coping mechanisms. And we help our service users find new ways to integrate with local people.
Here’s a great example of how we partner with local organisations in simple ways. It makes a real difference.
Please see our GOALs youtube channel. You’ll see more examples of how we help.

Children, Young People & Families



We successfully engage families who feel excluded or find themselves facing complex challenges.





 
Home » Services » Children, Young People & Families


A Strong reputation
DISC has a strong reputation in successfully delivering support services for children, young people and families. We are regularly re-commissioned by funding services and local authorities because of our effectiveness in this area of work.
See our Children, Young People and Families case studies
DISC offers risk and resilience support services to children and young people in a variety of areas of need such as: –

Young carers and young adult carers
Children and young people effected by parental substance misuse
Young people who are lesbian, gay bi-sexual or transgender
Young people who have queries or issues around their gender identity

We also provide wide ranging support to families through the delivery of our two  Family Intervention Projects (known as FIPs).
Psycho-social interventions
We use a variety of psycho-social intervention methods and models such as motivational interviewing, cognitive behaviour therapy and neuro-linguistic programming. And we have recently developed and implemented a new systemic families therapy model which is used across our services.
Roots to re-integration
These forms of intervention, together with an asset based approach to delivery, allow us to maximise the benefits of our service provision and provide our service users with increased empowerment, heightened self-esteem, strengthened coping mechanisms and routes to re-integrate with their peers and within their local communities.
National commissioners
Children, young people and families services are commissioned by national organisations such as Children in Need, The Big Lottery and Comic Relief as well as by local authorities.  We regularly work within partnership and consortium models to provide an holistic and more comprehensive service tailored to the individual needs of our service users.  In addition we also work in an asset based approach which draws upon the strengths, aspirations and social and emotional capital of both individuals and their communities to achieve long term resilience and outcomes.
A Strong reputation
Children, Young People & Families services here at DISC enjoy a strong reputation. We are known for working successfully with children, young people and families who are considered to be the hardest to reach. We put our service users first and take their views on board at all times.
DISC promotes choice – we make sure individuals have the opportunity to make their own decisions, allowing us to put a strong focus on their needs.

"I was unemployed with no qualifications or job references and had criminal convictions which made it difficult to find work. I heard of More Time through my brother, who was a service user and I started volunteering for More Time. 
"Within a couple of months I gained full time employment with More Time and within a year I was made Supervisor of my own team. As part of my role, I carried out renovations on many properties, where I used the skills I already had and I also learned new skills from the staff and volunteers I worked alongside.
As of April 2015 I am now employed by DISC Housing, as the Repairs & Maintenance Supervisor. As part of this role, I complete the day to day maintenance on DISC Housing’s properties and have completed full refurbs on the last of the Empty Homes properties. I have become a qualified PAT Tester and Damp Inspector and I am also planning on completing course in plastering in the near future.
Since I began working for More Time and DISC Housing, this has benefited my family and I in many ways, as I now have stable employment and a monthly wage and I am looking forward to gaining more qualifications a learning more new skills.
"I enjoyed working for More Time and now DISC Housing, it is hard work but I work as part of a team that know my skills and have the trust to allow me get on with my work on a daily basis. It’s a great team to work with."



Mark Pickard, DISC Housing

See our substance misuse case studies.

Treatment options include…

Psycho-Social interventions
Support to improve Community reintegration – helping people overcoming misuse or addiction problems to re-enter their local community.
Prescribed treatment and detoxification.
Access to residential rehabilitation.
Peer education and support programmes.
Counselling services.
Evidence-based structured intervention programmes, including group work and one-to-one sessions
Community prescribing/Medically Assisted Recovery.

Aftercare support and recovery networks.

We also offer criminal justice interventions to those offenders who are issued Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRR). Also,  Alcohol Treatment Requirements (ATR) sentences.

DISC has provided integrated substance misuse treatment and recovery services for both adults and young people across Northern England for over 20 years.
Well established
We deliver high quality, non-judgemental, safe services and environments which provide a range of treatment options and support to meet the needs of individuals – including for young people. Our ultimate aim for those affected by substance misuse is full recovery from dependency. We provide support at all stages of a person’s recovery journey.
Across our drug and alcohol integrated services in North Yorkshire, Leeds and Calderdale, we provided support for over 9,000 services users in 2015/16  and have been successful in supporting people to achieve recovery and improve their employment, housing, health and family situations.
Wrap-around services
We provide wrap-around services including:

Working alongside families, carers and loved ones.
• Support to improve people’s financial and housing status.
• Interventions and support to increase general health and well-being.
• Activities that promote community and social inclusion.

Treating people as individuals
Talking to people about their goals and aspirations at the outset and agreeing a recovery journey for each individual stands at the heart of DISC’s approach. We believe in working to people’s strengths and planning to help them develop the personal and community support needed for long term change.
Family Interventions
We focus on early, evidence-based intervention and prevention support to reduce the number of children, young people and families affected by drug and/or alcohol misuse.Our bespoke interventions for families and children have been extremely successful in reducing the impact of substance misuse and increasing family cohesion.
Recovery Communities
In partnership with service users and other stakeholders, we have developed a range of recovery community initiatives including recovery hubs offering a safe meeting space where a range of services and activities can be offered. See our BRiCWorks scheme in Hull. A variety of events and activities are delivered through our recovery hubs.
Changing lives in Leeds
In Leeds, 70% of clients stopped or improved their use within 6 months of entering treatment.
82% of clients who needed support to improve family relationships, including parenting successfully improved their relationships.
77% of clients with a highlighted need in relation to their financial situation, successfully improved their financial position
80% of clients with a housing-related need successfully improved their housing situation
We have supported clients through successful alcohol and opiate detoxs, with a 90% success rate.

Steve Littlewood – Senior practitioner & support worker for Leeds DIP IOM
We do lots of things to improve the mind-set. The reason I work for Disc is because I like working with people. We deal with people. They’re not units, they’re not statistics; they’re people.
If we didn’t support people in their recovery, in their journey to getting a meaningful life, the numbers of those needing help would be greater and there would be little other support.
People with a lot of complex needs tend to slip through the cracks. We provide a safe place for them here, we do a lot of outreach and we provide them, sometimes, with a reason to get up in the morning.
If you didn’t have organisations like Disc you would have a lot more people in and out of prison and using drugs; it’s a cycle. We help people maintain stability and help them try to live as much of an ordinary life as possible.

At DISC Housing, we’ve found a solution that means we can provide housing for people often considered by private landlords to be high risk.
View our DISC Housing case studies

People who are struggling with issues such as unemployment, substance misuse, domestic violence, mental health, physical disability, anti-social/offending behaviour, are leaving care, and have poor basic skills can find it very difficult to find a home. Private landlords are often wary of renting to them. DISC Housing has stepped in with a solution that bridges the divide.
DISC Housing – a growing portfolio
Most of our 200 plus lease agreements run between three and five years. However, this is flexible and will include specific break clauses and termination periods to suite the home owner and our own needs.
The DISC Housing team provide all of the property and intensive housing management functions for our properties and prides itself on the provision of high standard accommodation. We also work in conjunction with More Time UK Ltd.  DISC’s wholly owned trading subsidiary and social enterprise.
We offer accommodation in County Durham, Darlington, Hartlepool, Hull, Sheffield, Manchester and Bradford. Through partnering with local support providers, DISC helps people develop their independent living skills and maintain their tenancy.
We’re passionate about giving our tenants a voice in the delivery of our service.

DISC Housing currently own 21 of the properties, together worth over £1,000,000. Since 2013 we have been in partnership with the Empty Homes Community Grant programme.
We have 204 beds in 1, 2 and 3 bedroom properties, 3 small blocks of 1 bedroom flats, 4 hostel-type provisions and 12 small HMOs/shared houses, We also manage two properties on behalf of Bradford City Council designated specifically for people with learning disabilities.

In 2014/15 DISC Housing successfully completed the refurbishments of 12 properties (21 potential bed spaces) through a second Empty Homes Community Grants scheme.
65% of our tenants successfully moved on from our accommodation to longer term housing.
In a recent tenant survey -98% of tenants stated they are satisfied with the service they have received.

In 2015/16, we hope to become an investment partner with the government’s Homes and Communities Agency (HCA). We are working to secure additional funding to help more people live in more homes.
Are you a property owner?
For property owners, we offer long term leases, competitive rents, guaranteed income regardless of occupancy as well as all property management functions. All of our properties are of a good standard and meet the Homes and Communities Agency’s ‘Decent Homes Standard’ and are free from ‘Category One Hazards’ in relation to the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS)
To assist landlords, we provide:

Rent bond guarantee
Early identification and resolution of issues
Support to tenants to understand their rights and responsibilities
Tenancy-ready training
Mediatory service for landlords and tenants
Tenancy set-up
Guarantee payment of rent and occupancy

We give landlords the confidence and support to let property to people they may previously have thought ‘too risky’. We can increase the much needed availability of properties for vulnerable clients. By supporting tenants and landlords to resolve issues, we decrease the number of clients who are evicted, thus facing repeat homelessness.

“As a landlord, I am very pleased with DISC’s Housing Service, as it offers landlords and people in need, support with relevant professional help.
“DISC works with private landlords and helps tenants who would otherwise find it hard to seek a home to live in and tenants are supported through the entire process of their rehabilitation.”
Mr Mitchell lists a series of “benefits of a DISC lease as a private landlord", including…
“All clients are risk assessed to ensure they are safe to be in the community and are not a risk to others in the community.
“DISC’s private landlords are paid monthly and the landlords’ responsibility is passed to DISC in accordance with the lease agreement.
“Many landlords prior to partnering with DISC would have been unable to afford the cost of repairing and renovating their homes.”
And he writes:
“I have found DISC’s housing support service excellent. DISC manage the properties in accordance with their lease agreement, taking the responsibility of finding and vetting tenants away from the landlord and/ or the landlord’s agent
“The DISC lease ensures the rent is paid every month by BACS directly to the said landlord.”
He said his “strong recommendation” is to “engage with DISC, if you are a landlord seeking the security of a five year lease.”

Housing Related Support



Helping people to access and sustain suitable housing





 
Home » Services » Housing Related Support


Help to achieve Independent living
DISC has been providing housing related support for more  than 25 years.
We help vulnerable people in the community. They may be homeless, at risk of homelessness or at risk of losing their tenancy. they may also live in poor quality or temporary accommodation. Or they may be  sofa surfing. On a typical day, our housing related services support over 1,000 clients.
See our Housing Support case studies.
Service users may have mental health problems. They may be offenders, drug and alcohol misusers, young people leaving care, young single mothers. they may have social exclusion issues. Or they may belong to minority groups – they may be gypsies or travellers.
Our Housing Related Support stretches across seven North of England local authority areas. They’ve won Level A or B validations in the nationally-recognised ‘Supporting People’ Quality Assessment Framework QAF.


Floating Support
A main focus is ‘floating support’ for people in emergency accommodation, hostels, half-way houses and in independent tenancies.
We can advocate for service users. We’ll talk to local authorities, housing associations, social service departments and private landlords. We help people to get the accommodation they need. We help sort out their tenancy agreements and any access to housing benefits.
Real housing related support
It’s aimed at helping people maintain their accommodation. We help develop independent living skills including money management, cooking and even DIY.
We also provide emotional support and develop motivational skills. We help service users who are already in  accommodation. We make sure they don’t lose their accommodation because of a lack of independent living skills.
Our teams provide ‘Tenancy Ready Training’. This is for people with either a history of failed tenancies or for those who have not yet lived independently or managed a previous tenancy.
An all-round offering
We own or rent property across Northern England. And because our charity offers many different services, we can help our clients with things like employment, training, family support, health and well-being. We tell some service users, for example, about DISC’s drug and alcohol treatment services, DISC Housing or point  them to other specialists.
Achievements
We’re exceeding national targets.
We supported 3,800 clients in 2014/15.

93%  sustained independent living 3 months after exiting our support
95%  avoided homelessness or eviction (benchmark 91%)
95% improved  their physical health and sense of happiness and well-being (bench mark 91%)
97%  engaged better with friends, family and services within their local community
96% maximised their household income through finding work or accessing correct welfare assistance

Darlington Positive Support Pathway (PSP)  YMCA/DISC Partnership - Darlington SP review - August 2015
Extract taken from final report:    The service is very focused at trying to ensure that all young people, regardless of their needs and the risks they pose, are supported through the PSP and as the service embeds young people are being given every opportunity to engage in support and YMCA/DISC are effectively ‘thinking outside of the box’ to support some very challenging young people.
Overall the PSP appears to be working well and there are more opportunities for young people to engage in support.
The staff were all very passionate about the service and committed to delivering the best possible outcomes for the vulnerable young people supported.

Offender Rehabilitation



DISC delivers a range of services around offender rehabilitation





 
Home » Services » Offender Rehabilitation


Person-Centred Offender Rehabilitation
DISC’s Offender Rehabilitation work goes back to our charity’s inception in 1984. We deliver a range of innovative criminal justice services  managing and supporting offenders to improve their opportunities, in line with the government Transforming Rehabilitation programme.
See our Offender rehabilitation case studies here
We work to reduce social exclusion by partnering with other agencies. Within Community Safety Partnerships, DISC promotes and develops integrated service delivery pathways with criminal justice agencies and social and health care providers.
Helping service users turn the corner
DISC carries out its work across the community and the prison system. We believe in providing holistic support which addresses service users’ individual and often complex, multi-disciplinary requirements. We want to enable service users overcome multiple issues, reduce or end their offending, and stay in a job.
Working with primary agencies
DISC has tried and tested communication networks and working relationships with prison establishments, Community Rehabilitation Companies and the police. We deliver an end-to-end provision from prison and the community which routinely challenges offending behaviour and supports individuals to make important behavioural changes, aligned to the offender management model. We link together a range of funding streams to offer effective support that can make a life-changing impact on individuals’ lives.
Our specialist services for offenders

Housing and resettlement support,
Prison link services, prison peer education programmes,
Substance misuse services, specialist young offender programmes,
Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programmes
Initiatives to reduce anti-social behaviour.

 DIP/IOM Services
DISC has provided successful drug intervention programmes since 2007, providing Offender Management and Recovery focused services which target the most criminally active groups which include offenders registered to IOM and Prolific and Priority Offenders (PPOs).
In Leeds, the co-located model partners (i.e. Police, Prisons, Probation and DISC) work cohesively and jointly operate standardised procedures. Together, we deliver a range of interventions that reduce the risk of re-offending.
We focus strongly on engagement and programme completion.  We also offer signposting to further services, such as employment, training, education, housing support and benefits whilst providing support for carers and family members.
In partnership with the Police, Leeds DIP and IOM teams were involved in a number of police-led operations across Leeds aimed at reducing burglary – the primary serious crime type in Leeds. This initiative led to a 37% reduction in house burglaries between 2011 and 2013.
Community Order Treatment Requirements
Across our substance misuse programmes in Leeds, Calderdale and North Yorkshire we work alongside criminal justice agencies providing structured treatment and regular drug testing treatment to those offenders who are issued Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRR), Alcohol Treatment Requirements (ATR) sentence.
Specialist Housing Support
We offer specialist housing support to offenders in Lancashire and Sefton, providing supported accommodation to enable ex-offenders to resettle in the community including those under MAPPA and PPO orders.

Awards and Commendations
DISC North Yorkshire Horizons drug and alcohol service has recently been commended by  North Yorkshire police for the work carried out in Selby, which has led to a dramatic decrease in offences involving drug possession this year, compared with figures from 2014.
Leeds DIP service was awarded the Tackling Drugs, Changing Lives Award  Home Office  – Drugs and Criminal Justice Category 2009.

Clinical Services









 
Home » Services » Clinical Services


DISC are passionate about addressing health inequalities. We work in partnership with commissioners, the NHS, Public Health and the voluntary sector to deliver high quality services to vulnerable and excluded groups.
We believe in being fair and respectful to all and in applying rigorous quality standards.
DISC’s Clinical department formed as a result of the merger between DISC and St Martins Healthcare Services CIC (SMHS), a community interest company which was formed from St Martin’s Practice, a long established, experienced Primary care and Specialist Community Drug and Alcohol Services provider in Leeds.  This link with an NHS provider remains important to us and we continue to work closely with our primary and secondary colleagues.
We now deliver Community Substance Misuse Medical Services to the populations of Leeds, Calderdale, Barnsley, Tameside and Bolton including community detoxification and wider healthcare services.

Home » Services » #DISC2020


Going the extra mile for our service users
#DISC2020 is our commitment to support 2,020 people into employment, training and volunteering by the end of the year 2020. We know that our service users not only have the potential to improve their financial situation with employment training or volunteering, but also it can improve their mental and physical health. It drives a feeling of wellbeing and improves self- worth.
Our #DISC2020 Vision
We wish to embed cross-unit working within DISC, ensuring all units work towards a common theme of supporting people into employment, training or volunteering
We know that our service users not only have the potential to improve their financial situation, with employment training or volunteering, but also it can improve their mental and physical health. It drives a feeling of well being and improves self- worth.
WOW Clubs
We intend to extend our successful WOW Club model across the North.  Watch our videos  to learn more about WOW Clubs from staff and service users.

More on the WOW Factor
The Proposal
Each DISC service unit will continue with their typical daily duties, with #DISC2020 raising the importance of employment/training/volunteering and its benefits for service users and staff.  Units will report on a regular basis the number of service users they have supported – with each unit contributing towards the overall objective of 2020 by the end of year 2020.
Moving forward the detail capture and the success for #DISC2020 can be utilised in bids and applications for funding.
How will it happen?
With the support and drive of DISC’s senior management team,  #DISC2020 will have:

Guidance to provide a framework for recording progression into employment/ training/ volunteering
Training delivered to Champions who will lead out the vision in each area
World of Work (WOW) Clubs will be rolled out in all areas. WOW clubs are facilitated by staff to support service users on their journey into employment/training/volunteering, pulling together units within DISC, via cross referrals and other more localised provision – driving cross unit working
