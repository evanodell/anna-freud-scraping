Making a big impact
At PSS, we’re committed to helping people change their lives for the better. We want to provide services that strengthen communities and empower people, and we’re always on the hunt for new ways we can help. To make sure we’re doing this, we need to measure how many people’s lives we touch, how good we are at what we do, and the value of our services. All of these things show us our social impact.
We’ve produced a series of reports to show everyone the impact we have, and today, we published our latest one, which looks at our Supporting Prisoners’ Families service. The  Supporting Prisoners’ Families Social Impact Report looks at the work done by our Prisoners’ Families Service team, and the team who run the visitors’ centre at HMP Altcourse.
We’re often told about the many ways we change the lives of the people who use our services. Our social impact reports shine a light on these stories, making them clearer and showing us how we can keep on getting better.
Read our reports.

Saying goodbye to The Leeson Centre
It’s a sad day at PSS as we wave goodbye to one of our three Liverpool wellbeing hubs – The Leeson Centre in Speke.
We’ve been running some of our wellbeing services at The Leeson Centre for over 19 happy years, but after some recent Clinical Commissioning Group funding cuts, we’re packing up our bags and heading off to pastures new.
We’re currently setting up a new venue for some of the wellbeing courses ran at The Leeson Centre and we’ll keep you updated as soon as we can. In the meantime, if you were interested in attending a course at The Leeson Centre and would like some more information about where you can access similar courses, please get in touch and we’ll be happy to help:
Tel: 0151 708 0415
Email:  wellbeingcentres@pss.org.uk
It’s the end of an era and we’d like to say a big thank you to everyone who has used our services at The Leeson Centre over the years.
Find out more about how our services can help you look after your wellbeing and change the way you think.

Women Against Domestic Abuse Cup 2017



 
July 21, 2017

Women Against Domestic Abuse Cup 2017
Some of the team from our Women’s Turnaround Service laced up their football boots and hit the pitch this week, as they took part in the Women Against Domestic Abuse Cup 2017.
The annual tournament, which is currently in its fourth year, was set up to raise awareness around domestic abuse, and was jointly organised by Liverpool Homeless Football Club and Liverpool County FA with Liverpool City Council City Safe, The Morgan Foundation, The Power League, Worst Kept secret, Regenda Housing heavily supporting the day and support from Blackburne House, Liverpool YMCA,  and Stanley Park CIC.
Lots of our fab PSS People got behind the event and we teamed up with Merseyside Community Rehabilitation Company, so we had two teams playing on the day – one called ‘The Nutcrackers’ and one called ‘The Minions’. Neither team had much football experience, but after some ‘intense’ training sessions, they were raring and ready to go.
The tournament started with both teams being placed into groups. The Nutcrackers got off to a flyer with a resounding 5-0 win in their first game. The Minions also had a wonderful start with a 3-1 win. The two teams continued their fine form, both winning their second game. The third game proved a little bit more tricky with both teams suffering defeats, but the two earlier wins proved enough for both teams to qualify from their groups and take part in the knockout stages.
The Minions suffered a 3-2 defeat in the knockout stages but The Nutcrackers got another win (partly to some goalkeeping heroics from Women’s Turnaround Service Manager, Sharon Cooper) to make it through to the Semi Final.
Unfortunately The Nutcrackers didn’t make it past the semi final after losing cruelly on penalties. But a fantastic day was had by all, and for two teams who had never played together before, they certainly put on a show – and for a fantastic cause.

Lynn passes on her passion for coaching

Lynn passes on her passion for coaching
We’re so proud to tell you a story this week about how one of our wonderful PSS people, Lynn Robertson, has won a special award for her work and passed on her passion for what she does to one of the women she works with.
Lynn, who works at our Women’s’ Turnaround service, has been given an award by Merseyside Sports Partnership (MSP) and Reach Coaching for her fantastic work as an inspirational female coach.
The award is part of MSP’s #PassOnYourPassion campaign, which aims to raise awareness of the important part female coaches play in getting people involved in sport and hopefully inspire more women to become qualified coaches. Lynn runs a women’s boxing club for the people who use our Women’s Turnaround services.
In the letter they wrote to her, MSP said: ‘We’ve heard incredible things about your work and want to thank you for your contribution as a coach, leader, facilitator, trainer or instructor in Merseyside. We love that you utilise your passion for your sport to inspire others to get involved and make sure they get the most out of their sporting experience. We really wish there were more coaches just like you.’
Last week, Lynn received a certificate to celebrate her achievement and, along with it, the Baton of Passion, to pass on to another inspirational female coach in the making at her boxing class this week. Lynn chose to pass the baton to  one of the women who attends the boxing group.  Lynn said: ‘I feel extremely proud to be nominated by MSP for the great work we do with the girls. Passing on the baton to Stevie is an honour; she deserves it and will make a great coach one day.’
Our service-user was really happy to receive the award and, (tissues at the ready!), tweeted this wonderful message of thanks:
 

 
 
We’re so proud to have amazing people like Lynn on our team, and we’re really proud of our service-user, too – well done, everyone!

It’s Co-production Week 2017!



 
July 3, 2017
Lisa Davies
It’s Co-production Week 2017!
We’re taking part in Co-production Week, which takes place 3 July – 7 July, so we’d like to tell you a little bit about how we make co-production happen at PSS.
What is co-production, anyway?
‘Co-production’ is about people who use services and people who run services working together as a team. It’s about everyone being equal, and about people who use services having a say on what happens and when.
Here at PSS, we think that’s really important. The people who use our services have a say and get involved in as many things as possible; you guys are the reason we do what we do and you play a huge part in making sure we’re doing things right.
So, to celebrate Co-production Week, here are some of the great ways we work together:
Designing our services together
Everyone experiences life differently and we want our services to help everyone we meet as much as we can. That’s why we like to work together with people who use our services; to understand what life’s like through their eyes, make sure we’re getting things right, and do things to help.
The Making Days Committee is made up of the people who use our Making Days service. They meet up every month to talk about all things Making Days and what activities they would like to see happen. They have recently organised an election for Chair and other positions on the committee, which everyone who uses the service voted in.
Parents and carers of the people who use our Making Days service also get together once per quarter. They are treated to presentations and talks from our fab Making Days service-users and answer questions, discuss how things are going, share information and give us their ideas.
Over in Wales, we have a big meeting with some of our service-users at the beginning of each year, to talk about all the things we can get up to over the course of the year. Some people we work with are involved in other organisations, like Mind, and they tell us about any local events we can attend as a big group. Similar meetings also take place in our Midlands office.
Telling our stories
Storytelling is a great way for everyone to learn – it helps us learn about each other, about the world and about what can be done to help.
Putting pen to paper
Our Grandparents Group is made up of some of the grandparents who take care of children using our Family Impact services. Each month these super-grans, nans and grandads get together to support each other and influence how we provide support with our services. They talk about their own life stories and introduce the service to welcome new grandparents into the group. This support has inspired the group to work with a writing company to produce a ‘What’s your story’ book, that will include a number of short stories about their past experiences, their achievements, their struggles, and how life has changed for them. When it’s published, the group hopes it will support other families in similar circumstances and help others to understand the difficulties they face.
Lights, camera, action!
Film is a great, creative way we work together and express ourselves.
The young people who use our Young Carers service helped us to write a bid to the Youth Fund in Sefton. As a result, they were awarded some money to produce this fantastic film, together with a company called Collective Encounters, about what it feels like to be a young carer and how the Young Carers group has helped them.
Our communications team are also busy planning an exciting new film project with service-users at Making Days. We’re gathering a team of people to direct, film, produce and star in a film about the service through their eyes. We all hope it’ll give people looking to join in with the service a really good look at all the fun stuff that goes on and some of the fab people they’ll meet – like Jackie, who we’ll talk about next.
Using our voices
Jackie, who uses our services at Making Days South, was supported by one of our lovely student social workers to find out more about Williams Syndrome, a condition she lives with. Jackie made a brilliant presentation about what she learned, and gave a talk to parents and carers during one of our ‘Keeping in touch’ meetings. She then came along to our Liverpool offices where she drew a big audience of PSS People and some social workers who were visiting us from America, completely packing out the staff room.









Jackie is really enjoying her new-found talent for public speaking and is available to visit you and educate you on this fascinating subject – just give the guys at Making Days South a ring.
Building our team
At PSS, we only invite big-hearted, open-minded, determined, professional and genuine people to come and be on our team. Our service-users know exactly what type of people would make good carers/support workers/family workers/therapists and managers because they work with them all the time – so we often invite them to come and be part of interview panels, to help make sure our potential new team members are right for us; no matter how senior or experienced the person is.
Asking all the right questions
Team Wales (which is what we like to call our small but mighty PSS Wales team) have worked with the people who use their services to come up with a list of important questions. Whenever the team needs to interview a new staff member, they get in touch with a group of individuals who are regularly available to take part, and between them, the group choose which questions they want to ask from the list, and come up with their own extra ones, too. We think PSS People are all pretty special which tells us one thing – our service users make great judges of character.
Being there for each other
We’ve learned that when people going through similar things support each other, great things can happen. Many of our services offer the opportunity for people on similar journeys to come together and share their experiences, make friends and help each other out.
Together for mental health
The amazing team of Wellbeing specialists at our Wellbeing Centres have supported the people who use our services to develop and run a wide range of fabulous peer support groups. Our peer support groups give people the opportunity to share their thoughts, emotions and experiences in a safe, non-judgmental environment, making friends and supporting each other on their wellbeing journeys.  Some of our peer support groups involve getting involved in activities, like poetry, arts and crafts, drama or gardening. Others involve simply getting together with like-minded people for a cup of tea and a chat about the things affecting each group – like taking care of your wellbeing as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, living with bipolar disorder or hearing voices/experiencing visions or similar unusual experiences. We think this is a stellar example of co-production.
Sharing and caring
In Wales, we run a service called Shared Days, which offers support for people with dementia. Shared Days works by introducing two people who share similar interests and are living with dementia. Facilitated by one of our team, the pair are then able to get out and about and do the things they enjoy together – allowing them to support each other through friendship and shared experiences.









Growing together
Sharing activities brings us all close together – and having something to show from our co-production makes it all the sweeter, especially when it’s a delicious crop of strawberries from Dutch Farm.
Dutch Farm is an allotment ran by a group of people who use our Making Days North service, and some of our fantastic green-fingered volunteers. Everyone in the Dutch Farm group gets their very own raised bed, and the group work together to decide which crops are grown and which tasks need completing each day.









The guys at Dutch Farm have also recently worked with Chester Zoo to provide a Wildlife Champions course, which involved service users from both Making Days North and Making Days South. Safe to say it was a roaring success (sorry).

Gail, a MA Social Work student, with PSS, visited Dutch farm yesterday and received a very warm welcome from all the service users. In particular, Darren and Tony, who spent time showing Gail, around and talking about the seasonal changes and what they get involved in throughout the year. It was a lovely opportunity to not only see what Dutch Farm is doing and planning to do but also to see the clear enjoyment and therapeutic benefits the service users gain from being involved in the project and its activities.
Tony, who travels all the way in from Waterloo was talking about his ideas for helping to raise funds for the project and Darren spent time explaining how they have cleared areas for compost growing, plants and vegetables and showed me the mosaic’s they have made which will be on display around the project. There was also a lovely cup of tea and a chat on offer with other service users in their canteen who shared their experiences of being at Dutch Farm and how they work as a team to grow and maintain the farm. Gail is looking forward to visiting throughout the year and sitting on one of the many creative seating areas that are in the process of being done. It truly is a little haven within the city and well worth a visit. PSS has a great facility that can be utilised by its other projects as part of their programmes

We will be around for future generations.



 
April 4, 2017
Conor Anderson
We will be around for future generations.
One of the themes of the Big Plan is “we will be around for future generations” and a key objective in this theme is around IT. Our Midlands team have really embraced the changes we’ve made to IT, over the last couple of months and now have a paperless office.
There are many advantages to this change – savings in paper, time and duplication. But here’s an advantage they weren’t expecting….. Hollie Taylor from the Midlands team, has been working with one of our service users for the last two years. He is quite an anxious person and he does not like to have meetings with “professionals” especially when they interrupt his normal routine. Over the time Hollie has been working with him, she has found it quite difficult to build a positive relationship as he has seen her as another professional ‘poking her nose in my life’ but that’s all changed! Hollie met the man this week. When she arrived at his house she showed him her new Surface Pro laptop, explaining that it was her new gadget to work from to make things run smoother when she does her visits.
He was really impressed with it and asked if he could have a look. Hollie is lucky if her meetings with this man last an hour. This visit lasted more than two hours. In that time he mastered the Surface Pro, but he also talked to Hollie about all sorts of issues. As Hollie says “after almost 2 years of working on interaction and engagement with this individual, including the small things like even just making eye contact, who knew that it would only need a Surface Pro to achieve all of this!”

Staying Connected with Mi Connections

Staying Connected with Mi Connections
The Mi team have certainly been busy over these past few months. As always, the Mi Connections team are committed to ensuring that PSS people are given every opportunity to get connected and develop their digital skills. Here is a insight of some of the exciting digital activities that have been taking place:
This year, our Project Worker, Julian Connor made it his mission to promote the national Get Online Week in a new and innovative way by launching a Twitter competition.
Mi Connections provided a jar of sweets and then people were challenged, to guess the number of sweets in the jar and tweet their guess using the #GOLW16. The aim was to promote the service, encourage people to register and access Twitter, and to get PSS people talking and thinking about their digital skills.
The fabulous Jackie Carroll from Front of House was the winner and was given a £50 Love2Shop Voucher. Well done Jacky!
Digital Skills
Julian also delivered a series of four digital skill drop-in sessions in the Cwtch, for both staff and service users, to support them to develop their digital skills. During these sessions, Julian supported people to learn about email, social media, YouTube, how to access Learn My Way – an online learning resource- and helped people explore the internet and its endless possibilities.
We really believe in removing any barriers that people experience in getting connected- so if you or someone you know would benefit from a bit of extra help to get online and develop your’re digital skills, please contact the Mi connections team on 0151 702-5592
Digi Club
Working with the wonderful team at Making Days North, we have set up a weekly digital learning club attended by people who access the service. The club meets at Walton Life Rooms, where they come together to develop their experience of using IT, tablet and digital technology.The Mi connections team have also set up a weekly digi club at the Fusion Centre. Clients have even brought in their own tablets / iPads to learn how to use it more effectively.

Family Impact: Reward Day

Family Impact: Reward Day
You may remember the Prison My Parent and Me documentary that was aired on BBC a few months ago (Click Here if you don’t) Well the Children involved in the making of the documentary went on a Rewards day to Media City in Manchester, as a treat for all there hard work around the Documentary.
The BBC Radio 5 Live was the first stop on the tour, the Children got to be Radio presenters for the morning and found out first hand just what it takes to have a career in Radio. The group got a look in the Recording booth for when artists sing Live on the show and even got to have a go of some of the instruments famous artists have used.
Next the group set there sights on the TV studios where they got a behind the scenes look at some of their favourite TV shows which included some stories and some tips on how the presenters and actors do there shows the group even got to try on some of the costumes and test the props. They also had the chance to work on the BBC North West Tonight set, presenting the News and Weather. (I think this was our volunteer Paul’s favourite part)
It was a fantastic day out and a truly well deserved one!

A Year At PSS: A year of challenges, a year of opportunities



 
January 10, 2017
Conor Anderson
A Year At PSS: A year of challenges, a year of opportunities
An introduction to our Annual Report 2015/16 from our Chair; Mark Rathbone.
As anyone who works in the Health and Social Care sector will know, the last twelve months have seen the continuation of elevated need across some of our most vulnerable communities.
Unfortunately this has been further impacted by reductions in public spending and a reputational crisis around some of the UK’s best known charity brands. The wider reaching implications of such controversies are yet to be seen but we as a sector have undoubtedly seen increased scrutiny in how we go about our business activities. Vitally this means we have needed an increased focus on ensuring we are transparent and fully accountable not only as Trustees but to those people we serve in our communities.
Within PSS this has encouraged us to look again at our internal practices, not only in terms of how we deliver our front line services but how we run our organisation as a whole. Over the past year we have refocused the objectives of our in-house Quality and Compliance team, and have welcomed John McLean as head of the department. Under his leadership, and with feedback from managers across the organisation, we refreshed our in-house Quality Review process. We have also rolled out our Impact Reporting toolkit and as this report goes to print we are in the process of capturing data to ensure we are well on our way to completing Impact Reports for all services by the end of 2016-2017.
Opportunities in the face of adversity
A key theme for 2015/16 was to refresh our existing models of support to make them both more relevant for the people who need them and to make the support we provide as cost-effective as possible.
One such project currently finding its feet after launching in March is our Homeshare initiative, a pilot project funded by the Big Lottery. Our innovative take on the existing Homeshare model matches older adults in social housing with a care leaver in need of a home. In contrast to other pilots across the UK this version of Homeshare will take a two pronged attack on inequality by tackling social isolation for the elderly whilst providing training opportunities for young people.
Aside from refreshing how we deliver our services, we’ve also been keen to look for new ways to fund our projects and our first piece of work in the city of Manchester is a prime example of tackling a new payment model. The ‘Shared Lives Incubator’ is the first of its kind and utilises social investment from numerous charitable trusts to rapidly expand the Shared Lives model within Manchester. In line with our mission our involvement in this project puts PSS at the forefront of innovation within a service we started back in the 1970s.
This year has also seen our hospital based domestic violence service, The Ruby Project, expand to cover Aintree Hospital. The Ruby team have achieved this following extremely positive feedback and clear returns on investment from their work at Liverpool’s Royal Hospital. Plans are now in place to grow the service further and to create longevity for the service by securing contracted funds outside of charitable grants.
Last but by no means least our new Making Days services are a great example of how we as an organisation can make an impact on a large scale in a relatively short time-scale. Following our success with the tender to take over two of Liverpool City Council’s day services in summer 2015 we recruited over 70 new team members using our ‘values-based’ system, and as a result hired people from various backgrounds and sectors. Over the second half of 2015/16 our teams have done a phenomenal job taking the existing centres and transforming the way they are run and the support individuals receive.
Aside from direct service delivery 2015/16 saw a big investment in our IT infrastructure. During the year we replaced much of our outdated hardware and software, increasing the speed of our networks and capability of our technology. This has created a very strong platform for our future plans to lead the way in Assistive Technology and state of the art Health and Social Care electronic systems. We also introduced a new helpdesk resource to support our organisation and to assist team members who are less confident with IT. This will be complimented by increased IT training and coaching in the next financial year.
As always, we as an organisation are eternally grateful for the support we receive from our stakeholders, the friends of PSS, our commissioners and, of course, the people who use our services. Each of these groups are vitally important in making the work we do a success and we hope that as we continue moving forwards in the run up to our centenary, you will continue to be proud of your associations with PSS.
I know that I can speak for the rest of the Board when I say that we are all very proud of what PSS has achieved during what has been a very turbulent year for our sector. I’d like to thank my colleagues on the Board, and indeed across the whole of PSS, for all your hard work. We hope to welcome a continued period of opportunity for 16/17 and I for one have high hopes for what’s around the corner.
Mark Rathbone, PSS Chair

Elaine finds freedom through our hospital DV service

Eleanor Riley
Elaine finds freedom through our hospital DV service
Elaine was referred to the Ruby project, although she stated that she did not feel she was suffering abuse. Elaine’s cultural background and the fact that she was married meant that she did not think that what she was experiencing was domestic abuse. Elaine stated she was scared on a daily basis, worried that her husband would take her children back to her country of origin and concerned that she would lose her job. In reality was experiencing sexual, physical, emotional and financial abuse over a period of 12 years. The project worked with Elaine to create a safety plan and secured emergency accommodation whilst securing an order to get Elaine’s husband to leave the family home.
The police were informed of the situation and placed a TAU marker on the home in case of further incidents, and an alert was placed on the children’s passports to prevent them from leaving the country. The outcome was that Elaine continues to work and provide for her family, whilst instigating divorce proceedings against her husband. She and her children have returned to the family home and there is a non-molestation order in force against her husband. Following an assessment, children’s services were happy with the actions Elaine has taken and thanks to becoming aware of what she was experiencing and the support available – Elaine is now living a life free from abuse.
What Elaine days:“Thanks to the project, I have now begun to live my life. I knew it was wrong – but I didn’t recognise that it was abuse. I felt like my life was on hold and I had no control over anything. I am so grateful now I have my life back and my children are safe”.

Susan’s new home with Supported Living

Eleanor Riley
Susan’s new home with Supported Living
Susan is a lady in her 50s with a moderate leaning disability. She has lived all her life in the family home supported by her parents. Both her Mum and Dad are in their 80s and were starting to struggle to meet her needs.
Working with the social worker, Susan and her family viewed several supported living properties but were very apprehensive about her leaving home and being able to cope with independent living. However, after viewing a PSS property they all agreed that this was the best option. They all felt that the house was very homely, the staff very professional and caring and that this could be a home for Susan. Initially she visited several times, coming for dinner with the other people living in the property and this then built up to an overnight stay. Susan then signed a tenancy agreement with the service.
Admittedly there were difficulties in settling in; but Susan now considers PSS home and gives lots of praise. She has been on holiday and now has a busy schedule supported by the staff. Susan’s parents are very grateful for the support that she has had with PSS and they feel safe in the knowledge that Susan is well supported if anything were to happen to them.

Terry’s Supported Living Story.



 
December 23, 2016
Eleanor Riley
Terry’s Supported Living Story.
Terry has suffered from depression and anxiety most of his adult life which led to him relying on alcohol which compounded his mental health problems and resulted in his divorce from his wife. Following this, Terry was admitted to a long-term hospital stay. After he was discharged, Terry was introduced to PSS supported living where he has now been for six years, and says that since living with PSS his life has changed.
“I feel a lot of pressure has been lifted and I have no worries over bills or money.” Says Terry “There are people around who I can talk my problems over with. I receive support with my problems with alcohol. I never feel isolated or lonely as there are other people around most of the time”. Terry is now encouraged to get involved in activity groups which builds up his confidence and means he doesn’t turn to alcohol to help with his problems. He has made new friends within the Project and has even had a holiday to Spain. He has also recently saved up and bought a television and hi-fi system for his room. Terry is now in a much better frame of mind and is settled within Supported Living and enjoying good mental health.

Women’s Turnaround makes a difference: Social Impact Report 2016.



 
December 22, 2016
Eleanor Riley
Women’s Turnaround makes a difference: Social Impact Report 2016.
The Women’s Turnaround Project based at PSS is a women-only service for residents in Liverpool, Knowsley, St Helens and Sefton who are involved with the Criminal Justice System, and a large proportion of whom are on probation. The project aims to help women address the reasons for committing crimes and to reduce the risk of further offending by modifying attitudes and behaviours, diverting women away from prison, preventing family breakdown, improving women’s wellbeing and supporting life changes to empower women to build a positive future.
The Corston Report published in 2007 looked at vulnerable women in the Criminal Justice System and highlighted the need for a holistic, woman-centred, multi-agency approach to meet the potentially complex needs specific to women offenders. The report particularly highlighted the importance of community-based service provision, the value of a one-stop shop approach, and the importance of providing resources not only to those women coming into contact with a criminal justice agency but also for women identified as at risk of offending, as they have similar identified needs. The Turnaround project aims to help women in this position, and does so in collaboration with probation, police, local courts, HMP Styal, Citizens Advice Bureau, local drug and alcohol services, mental health services, voluntary organisations, solicitors, housing associations, children centres, and social services.

PSS are committed to measuring the impact of all our services, and this is an ongoing process. You can read the rest of our reports here.

Don and Tony on their Summer Holidays.

Don and Tony on their Summer Holidays.
In September myself and Don went on holiday to North Wales and stayed in Park Resorts in Towyn for a week. The weather was on our side as each day we went out on adventures to Llandudno, Anglesey, Colwyn Bay and even Rhyl. 
Don was especially looking forward to taking me to the Welsh mountain zoo In Colwyn Bay were he enjoyed going to see the alligator (as you can see) and also the leopards. 
On one day we were sitting on Llandudno pier eating our ice cream when a seagull out of nowhere dive bombed me and swooped my ice cream which resulted in Don in hysterics and me a laughing stock in front of all the tourists, Don couldn’t stop laughing the whole day so it was worth it! 
Don had such a good time and asked when we he can go back so watch this space for round 2 next year!

A Day In The Life…..Sarah Dobie (Team Leader at Making Days: South)



 
November 30, 2016

A Day In The Life…..Sarah Dobie (Team Leader at Making Days: South)
05.00 My alarm goes off (it’s currently set as Callum Scott, Dancing on my own).  I randomly snooze this around 4 times. However in the meantime I will check my phone for any news, likes on my Facebook or new Anna Kendrick photos that may have been uploaded while I’ve been sleeping… wouldn’t want to miss out!!
05.30 I will be up, on to my breakfast which is either a protein shake or egg and toast. If I have no injuries (which is rare…accident prone!!) I will do either an 8 mile cycle or a 5k run. I live near the River Mersey in an apartment in Runcorn. Watching the sun rise and hearing the wildlife along the river is just awesome! It gets my mind in a great perspective for my day.
06.30 I am back home having fought with the lift and my bike, no doubt incurring a bruise or graze I’ll be sweaty and utterly disgusting but refreshed! I will have a protein shake and some water before its shower time.
07.30 Showered, dressed and preparing my lunch while dancing round, or lip syncing in the bathroom mirror to my playlist. I live for music!! Without it I would die. Dramatic but true!! Anything from KT Tunstall, The Spice Girls, Beyonce, Justin Bieber (sssssssssh can’t have everyone knowing,) I could go on and on and on. 
07.50 I am on my way to work. I drive through Hale village which I love and never fail to jump out of my skin though when an aeroplane appears out of nowhere over my car! Got to Love John Lennon Airport for this daily reality check. While on the way to work I will have a morning phone call with my girlfriend Natalie. We normally talk about Wentworth the TV show or about our families and weekend plans.
08.20 Arrive at Making Days South and enjoy a coffee (normally supplied by Emma Mac, Julie, Emma, John or Lyn) I am an awful brew maker. Before everybody arrives we have a random 10 minute conversations anything from Celeb Big Brother to Spirituality! There is always a daily quote or upbeat song on the go before the day starts!!  I check my emails and plan my day and its priorities. 
09.20 I will go out on to the floor and enjoy interaction with staff and Service Users. I will be out on the floor until around 10.30/40 when all activities will take place. This section of my day is my favourite. The buzz about the centre and the atmosphere is just unlike anywhere I have worked before. It’s vibrant, fun, positive and well magic. 
11.00 This section of my day is different on a daily basis. It may consist of meetings with Social Workers, Multi-disciplinary teams, and briefings with Team Leaders, Liaising with parents and carer groups. Support sessions, rota allocation, shadowing the referral process with Julie, organising presentations for university talks, supervisions, organising additional training for staff, a whole multitude of things really. I love the diversity my job role gives me. No day is ever the same! 
12.30 I have my lunch with service users where I hear about what they have all been doing in their morning sessions and what they are doing in the afternoon. I always get asked what I am having for my lunch so I try to make it healthy when really some days id just love to revolt and have a big fat chippy lunch. Though I do love the daily lunch aroma of Emma Mac’s noodles and smokey bacon crisps wafting through the office, it beats the Victoria’s Secret room spray Lyn and Julie love so much!   
13.00 My afternoon consists of much of the same as my morning does. With the impromptu interviews of David Pealing about what I’ve been up to and when am I setting up a Making Days South football team! Carol asking if I want coffee and Megan telling me about her caravan and how her shoes have given her blisters. There is music and singing from different groups. Our Making Days Mash Up consists of She’ll be coming round the mountain and Living Doll with some guitars and violins thrown in!!
15.30 This time of the day always is the loudest, busiest, and most chaotic. Simply because everybody is so excited to talk about their day with you and tell you about their weekend plans. 
16.00 Some staff Team building, to ensure we finish the week on a high!!! This varies from quizzes, congas, water games, chair sumo…I do hold out hope of a lip sync battle at some point soon too!! 
16.30-18.45 Catch up with Team Leaders and then dance or a sing song to whatever pops up on the radio and then on my merry way!!! It’s Friday which means not only is it time for a crunchie and super loud music in the car home and then an evening of organising my football team equipment for the next day as we kick off at 9am!!! 
19.00 Off to spiritualist church this place is my favourite space to relax after a busy week. It recharges my batteries and provides me an opportunity to tap into my mediumship
21.00 Finally home, Pjs on, Pitch Perfect on the kindle and relax!!

Shared Lives Merseyside introduces Shared Voices



 
November 29, 2016

Shared Lives Merseyside introduces Shared Voices
In July people who use our Shared Lives Merseyside service came together to relaunch their group Shared Voices. The group now meets regularly for a chat and a cuppa, to organise activities and discuss what is important to them.
As our group had been on pause for a while and the PSS team was keen to get the ball around service user involvement rolling again. “The people who use our service are at the centre of everything we do”, says Team Leader Gill Creevy, “We want them to know that and to be and feel actively included in the service and the PSS family.”
The people who live in Shared Lives Merseyside placements are as diverse as the things they like and dislike, their interests, beliefs, experiences and skills, their walks of life, abilities, support needs and personalities, their age range is between 18 and 83. So how do you come up with activities and topics for such a diverse group? Just ask.
Service Manager Bob Bell invited Lee Dowling (our cover page model), John Paul Brady and Ian Ruddock, who had previously expressed interest, for a couple of initial brainstorming meetings. They were immediately up for the plan, and came up with some great ideas for things to do and talk about. Invites went out to everyone and the relaunch meeting took place on the 6th July. We had a lively discussion, and everyone who came voted on their favourite ideas or added new ones. Suggestions were plenty and ranked from parachute jumping to bingo and bowling, model making, film nights and info talks.
We already had a quiz prepared by Hilary Mawdsley and Lee. Jason supplied the group with amazing homemade cake. Ian is very familiar with the local public transport and prepared cards for easier direction on bus routes for everyone and he always keeps the group up to date on the latest local events and activities. At the same time John Paul is currently preparing for a discussion of people’s experiences with volunteering opportunities. The group has grown since the first meeting and new ideas and voices are welcomed at all times.
Not everything is going to be suitable or interesting for everyone, but we have an enthusiastic Shared Voices committee of people who are happy to plan and organise things. The PSS team spread the word to everyone and the meetings and activities are open for anyone who lives in a Shared Lives placement to pop in.
“I enjoy coming to the meetings”, says Jason Ryan who is part of the committee and sees Shared Voices as an opportunity for a regular catch-up with other people in Shared Lives: “It’s great to meet people I know.”
Also PSS team members like Judy Cummings enjoy joining in: “It’s a great opportunity to meet people who use our service in a different setting and to hear what they have to say”. Shared Voices members take ownership of their group, as Pat Wainwright explains: “The PSS team is there if anyone needs any support and we can help to guide the group, but Shared Voices is a space for the people who use our service, and they decide what they want to do. People are happy to get involved and we want to keep this motivation ongoing.”
A big winner on the activity votes were days out – and the first one of those took place when the Shared Voices group went to visit the Shared Lives team in Wales for their Party in the Park in August. Everyone had a great time and the next outings are already being planned. For the next meeting Shared Voices has invited guest speakers from Merseyside Police to talk about Safety in the community and exchange people’s experiences.
During one of the meetings Ruth Thomas used her creative skills to surprise us all and wrote a poem about Shared Lives which now has a place of honour in our Seel Street office, and she has allowed us to share this with you all. 
S is for Special People
H is for Honest
A is for Always There For People
R is for Relationships
E is for Entertainment
D is for Determined
L is for Loving
I is for Inspiring
V is for Very Cool People 
E is for Energetic
S is for Sunny

The Making Days North Mini Olympics



 
November 28, 2016

The Making Days North Mini Olympics
It’s been a busy few months for the Making Days North team. The launch of the Making News team has opened up a platform for service users to talk about issues and events concerning them and the local community. 
Within the group service users choose topics that they think the rest of our centre will be interested in hearing about. They then plan how they will get the content (interviews, pictures etc.) and then chase up all the information in over a month or two. 
Here Ryan Batt, Making News’ chief reporter discusses last month’s Mini Olympics with Kyle Lee, Activities Coordinator at Making Days North.
So Ryan, can you tell us a little bit about the different activities that were on throughout the day?
“I started off with Walking Football. This was easy for everyone to try and if they like it they can join in on a Thursday”.
Kyle: The walking football group that we attend on a Thursday morning has been quite popular with our service users. Here in Liverpool, football plays a big part in many households. Walking Football is an accessible sport for lots of people no matter of their ability. 
“I then went on to do the egg and spoon race. You have to stay very calm, it was nice for everyone to have a try.”
Kyle Throughout the day we had tried to structure the events so that they were all inclusive. It was not about the winning, it was purely about taking part. The egg and spoon race was a highlight of the day where everyone could get involved.
“I was great at the Welly throw. Robert was very good at it too”.
Kyle: A popular event of the day was the welly throw. It was amazing to see how far everyone could throw, but even better to see was the smiles on people’s faces as they were trying something new. There’s not much resource involved with this activity, literally a couple of wellies and a few cones. Cheap, but very affective!
“I didn’t take part in the sitting down volleyball but I did enjoy cheering my mates on”.
Kyle: Since the mini Olympics, Making Days North has gone on to buy its own volleyball net. Sitting down volleyball is another example of how we can get more people involved without worrying about ability. We’ll be setting up our own team in the very near future, so if anyone would like to challenge us please drop us a line!
As the Olympic and Paralympic games were both set in Brazil this year we thought it would be nice to add a little taste of Rio to our event. In the afternoon we had two Zumba sessions that were led by the “Katumba Brazilian Drum troupe”. Katumba are one of Liverpool’s finest examples of Brazilian drumming. Julianna who runs the group is involved in a whole manner of different workshops and was very keen to get involved with our event. They provided the beats and rhythms for our service users to get involved with a bit of dance and a lot of exercise.
“I liked the drumming and the dancing, I even had a dance myself. I’ve been to Brazil and it was nice to see some Brazilian music at our event. It reminded me of being on holiday”.
Kyle: The final event of the day was one that everyone could get involved with. Our inclusive relay was split into three sections and was a great opportunity to bring everyone together.
“I did quite well in the relay, everyone tried their best. Everyone should be proud of themselves for taking part in this event”.
Kyle: To add a little glamour to the event everyone involved was awarded a Gold medal for taking part. There was no emphasis on winning all day. If you scored a goal you were praised, if you dropped your egg halfway through the race, you were praised. The fact everyone had a go at something new made the event a total success. 
Everton FC sent down Graeme Sharp to hand out the medals at the end of the event. Graeme did more than hand out medals, he spent time talking to Service users and Staff, and even had a little kick around with a couple of service users.
“I got my picture with Graeme Sharp. Even though I am a Liverpool fan and he played for Everton, It didn’t matter. It’s all about getting out and taking part.”
Kyle: Special thanks must be given to Frank Meadows and Crosby Stuart FC. Frank is a support worker at Making Days North, and in his spare time he runs a youth football team. A long with Liverpool City Council, Crosby Stuart FC provided most of the sporting equipment for the day. 
We’d also like to thank Rice Lane City Farm for providing such a great venue for our event. We will hopefully be working together again in the not so distant future.
Well done to all involved. You were all great.

Aloha! Making Days bring Hawaii to Merseyside

Aloha! Making Days bring Hawaii to Merseyside
Back in August, Making Days South made the most of the summer weather and attended a Hawaiian day at their centre set up by Bridge Chapel. 
The day was a huge success and attracted a lot of the local community, plus a number of younger visitors from the Bridge Chapel toddler group who took over the Hawaiian sand pit beach for most of the day.
There was even a visit from Making Days North who received a ‘Lei’ upon arrival and were offered some Hawaiian punch and fruit inside whilst being shown the excellent Hawaiian decorations made by the service users and getting a chance to play the Ukulele. David Peeling said “I love it that Making Days North are here, it’s great for us to all be together” 
Soon it was lunchtime, and the sunshine warranted nothing but a BBQ on the ‘Beach’. Burgers seemed to be the pick of the day, and not many people were after the Spam that was on offer (we’ll get to that later).
After Lunch everybody was spoilt for choice with beach soccer, a bouncy castle and even a little bit of hula dancing inside. 
The day finished with a Waikiki Spam Jam. A Spam Jam is a celebration of the people of Hawaii’s love for SPAM. Although Spam might not be to everyone’s taste, nobody minded having their photo taken with the Spam Jam sign!
 Making Days South Service Manager, Julie Humphreys said “ I would just like to say a big thanks to Bridge Chapel for putting on a fantastic day everyone has thoroughly enjoyed themselves, and it was wonderful to see the North Centre turn up”

Know Your Numbers
Familiar faces Claire D’Annunzio and Jacky Carroll are used to providing excellent customer service in their roles on front of house at Seel Street, but their recent secondment over to the Liverpool Health Trainer team has seen them test their people skills in operations. The project seems to be having great success and their community blood pressure checks may even have saved a life! Jacky tells us more… 
Last month Claire and I attended the Bridge Inn Community Centre in North Liverpool to deliver a drop in session for Blood Pressure Screening as part of our new pilot #HealthyLiverpoolKnowYourNumbers
As part of our role we’re always out and about taking people’s blood pressure, raising awareness and offering advice. During this particular session, one lady’s blood pressure reading was incredibly high, higher than I’d seen before in all the months of being out in the community. I took her blood pressure again to make sure I hadn’t made a mistake and it came up as even higher… this time160/90mmhg.
I strongly encouraged the lady to see her GP and explained the severity of the complications you can have with high blood pressure.  I wrote her reading down for her and gave her some written information around blood pressure, I also referred her to the Know Your Numbers website.
The following fortnight, the manager of The Bridge Inn Community Centre contacted me to let me know that this lady had popped in after several weeks away from the centre. When the manager asked where she’s been the lady said she’d gone to her GP after getting her readings back and her GP had admitted her to hospital for three days because of her high blood pressure, and also high cholesterol.
I’m proud to say that the lady said she thinks “This service is really good, getting my blood pressure done that day could have saved my life”
If you know someone who wants to check out their blood pressure please contact Jacky.carroll@pss.org.uk  or Claire.D’Annunzio@pss.org.uk

Summer Fun with Sefton Young Carers



 
November 22, 2016

Summer Fun with Sefton Young Carers
Sefton Young Carers have certainly had a summer to remember over these past few months. It started with a tour around Liverpool and an explore on the Crocky Trail. 
Over the summer the carers had lots of unforgettable days including: a trip to Leeds through the Liverpool Canal, learning how to play golf, a trip down to New Brighton Beach, a tour around Edge Hill University from Professor Andy Smith, and they ended their jam packed summer lakeside at Crosby Marina. 
We asked the parents what they thought, one parent responded with ” I could never repay what Young Carers have provided for my children this summer, you have truly gone the extra mile for them and it’s been welcomed all round”.
The parent was tearful as she said “I was fearing the summer and how I was going to manage with my 3 children, but it’s been the best summer EVER ”
Karen, Project Worker for the Young Carer service said:
“It was great to see how the children took something different from each trip.
One young boy couldn’t swim but after encouragement from peers and ourselves he went out in a bell-bottom boat and then went alone in kayak, it was a proud moment for all of us.. 
Another fantastic moment was from a young boy after we visited Edge Hill University, he said “I never thought in my life I would have got to go in a University”   as a team we hope to have broken down that barrier and hope he realises he can achieve anything he desires; plus more.”

Young Carer Patrick Scoops Award honouring our founder Eleanor Rathbone!



 
November 21, 2016
Conor Anderson
Young Carer Patrick Scoops Award honouring our founder Eleanor Rathbone!
We went to meet Patrick, one of our Sefton Young Carers after he won the Eleanor Rathbone award at the 2016 Believe Awards.
So where were the awards held?
The awards were at the Shankly Hotel in Liverpool city Centre, on the highest floor. It was supported by Radio City and Cash for kids but mainly Ykids. It was a really fun night the only problem was it was a Tuesday so I was really tired at school the next day!
How did you feel when you found out you’d been nominated?
I felt very happy when I got nominated and even happier when I won! I was so happy that I was crying, one of my other friends from school was nominated in another category, and he won too so it was a good day for our school.
Who do you care for?
I care for two people. Firstly my sister Mollie; she is kind of the reason I got my award. I help her by talking to her, speaking for her, playing with her, helping her with homework, and she seems to settle more when I am around, it helps to give my mum and dad a break. The other person I care for is my Nan. She is disabled and she needs help getting out the car and things, so I just walk with her and help to make sure she’s okay.
What Impact does Sefton Young Carers have on your life?
Sefton Young Carers has had a big impact on my life because they help me and give me a bit of a break from caring for my sister. It’s a great group, especially because I’m someone who can make friends with anyone and everyone is really nice and the activities are fun.
What is your favourite activity then?
My favourite activity is the football and it was great when the Everton coaches came in to coach us, but there was only one problem… I’m a Liverpool supporter!
I heard you help secure the funding for a Young Careers DVD?
Yes! Me and two other Young Carers secured the funding for the young carers animation DVD. It was like being on X factor we had to go in front of a panel and show a PowerPoint, then we went out, had the nervous wait just like the X factor and then got the good news! We were jumping for joy and then went to KFC… that was my favourite part.
I also heard you are doing some fundraising of your own soon?
I want to, yes. I want to do a charity night and I am currently planning all by myself. It will have a raffle and tickets that will be £1. I’m just getting a little bit of help off other people and giving any money I make half each to Y kids and PSS.
And finally do you have anything to say to everyone at PSS?
Not much really, just keep going don’t look back! If challenges lie ahead just step over it, they say it’s one big hurdle just try to jump over it. Don’t stop trying, just try and try until you can do it.
Patrick was nominated for the Eleanor Rathbone Award by Nuala Ward in our Sefton Young Carers Service: 
Patrick has been a Young Carer for his sister who has additional needs. Patrick helps his family in a number of ways, one of which is sitting with his sister until she falls asleep. Patrick selflessly does this to give his mum a break and to reassure his sister who will not settle down without Patrick. 
Patrick looks out for Mollie in school, helping with her with homework often dealing with challenging behavior which impacts on Patrick not being able to have friends round to his house. The practical and emotional support Patrick gives is invaluable to his mum and dad in their care for Mollie. 
Patrick has been coming to Young Carer’s over the past 12 months and is a valued member of the group. Patrick is always positive and has made a significant contribution to the service helping other children and young people in similar situations. 
Despite facing troubles of his own Patrick has been instrumental in ensuring other young carer’s voices are heard in Sefton, attending and informing the local council about how services could be improved to include young career’s health and wellbeing.
Young Carer’s wellbeing again has been at the forefront when in October 2015 Patrick attended the youth led bid and was successful in securing funding to raise wider awareness of Young Carers in Merseyside. Patrick is currently working to create a DVD showing the challenges young carer’s face. The DVD will be part of Patrick’s legacy to children and young people who care for family members as they often remain hidden.
I believe Patrick will be fondly remembered by teachers and pupils at his school, the young carer’s and other groups for the passion and commitment he shows when delivering presentations about his caring role and how he has overcome his own challenges whist making life better for his own family and other young carer’s.

Holly from Shared Lives Midlands shares a Short Breaks success story…



 
November 17, 2016

Holly from Shared Lives Midlands shares a Short Breaks success story…
I left the visit with an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction…”this is what we do it for”’
I’ve been working with a gentleman, Jon, who was referred to the service in June, and his mum, Judith to look at Jon accessing short breaks with a Shared Lives Carer(s).
Jon was referred to us during a family emergency a few months ago. His mum, Judith, had to go onto hospital for an ongoing spinal condition and there was nobody available at home to support Jon during this time. Judith had to arrange a ‘sit in service’ to stay with Jon during the day time, while his sister Pat was involved in ensuring he was safe at night.
Judith, told me that she felt very disappointed that her family were unable to support Jon during this time. She was also feeling very uncomfortable about the whole process of joining Shared Lives and was worried about how Jon would cope with the process. Jon is extremely close to Judith and can become very unsettled and upset when he does not have her to go home to.
Because of this, I knew the match had to be perfect for Shared Lives to work for Jon. I had identified Amrik and Gill (new Carers approved at the end of July) as potential Carers and I shared the profile with Judith and Jon. I explained to Judith that I would do everything I could to make her and Jon feel comfortable and at ease throughout the process and that we would take it at their pace.
Following these conversations with Judith, she contacted me again to say that she had explained the service and the process to Jon in extensive detail and Jon was looking forward to meeting Amrik and Gill!
I arranged an introductory visit for Wednesday 17th August and we all met at Amrik and Gill’s home.
Usually, at an introductory visit, one of the Shared Lives team very much leads the visit, for example we encourage both parties to ask a range of different questions and might even suggest some ourselves. But, at this visit I couldn’t get a word in edge ways! It was very much led by Amrik and Gill – meeting Jon and Judith was their first intro visit and they dived straight in. The conversation flowed so naturally, Amrik and Gill were extremely proactive in making both Jon and Judith feel welcome and asking productive questions that have impacted on the support plan we’d already completed. Before Jon and Judith left, Amrik and Gillian were already planning in the next steps! I left the visit with an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction that “this is what we do it for”.
I popped in to visit Jon and Judith the following Friday just to check in with them both. I had a conversation with Judith and she sang Amrik and Gill’s praises from the roof tops saying: “I felt so at home with them- I think I’d like to stay there instead of Jon!”
Judith told Jon “ive got good news: Amrik and Go;; would like to see you again” . Jon shouted “YES!” with a “get in” arm movement and appeared excited and wanted to know when he will be staying overnight there. Again, I left jon and Judith feel overjoyed. Its so fantastic to know that even after their apprehensive start, they were all smiles knowing that Jon will go on to stay with Amrik and Gill

Wanna Be a Be Well Barnsley Record Breaker?

Wanna Be a Be Well Barnsley Record Breaker?
Be Well Team Leader Shelly Wareing talks us through just what goes into organising a world record attempt
Walt Disney said “Around here we don’t look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we’re curious… and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths” It’s precisely this curiosity and search for something innovative, which lead us to our attempt to break the wold record for ‘Largest Chair Based Exercise Class’ on August 14th 2016 (the beauty of Chair Based Exercise being that anyone can take part, no matter what their ability).
It’s funny how things come about. I was in a weight loss group and someone mentioned chair based exercise and for some reason my thoughts turned to the Guinness World Records. Curiosity got the better of me and I wondered if there was a current record for anything to do with chair based exercise. The current record resided in Indiana, USA with 431 participants. The idea of holding the record attempt was to bring the community together and raise Be Well Barnsley’s profile. 
I felt it would be advantageous to hold it at a venue where a lot of people would already be that we could tag along with. The local park holds a gala every year and it’s very well attended. With a venue secured it was on to the logistics… I don’t know if you have ever applied for a world record but it’s a very long and thorough process! It takes quite a while for the strict guidelines to come through and when they arrived they brought a few surprises with them.
Firstly, the record had been broken between the time of application and the time of the guidelines arriving. The Chinese Women’s Institute beat us in July with 731 participants which raised the bar for us somewhat. The guidelines also stated that all the chairs had to be identical, which put a stop to our plan of asking for donated chairs from the community.
However, Be Well Barnsley likes a challenge so we set about sourcing 800-1000 chairs. After some begging and borrowing and being unable to find any free chairs, we finally agreed a deal with a chair hire company called Thorns. I then had to find a place to store the chairs over the weekend and arrange delivery. Myself and Gareth Roberts approached and secured funds from area Councillors to assist with costs… so we had our venue, our chairs, our instructor and staff to help. All we needed now was people willing to sit on chairs and do a spot of exercise.
We had a frantic month of promotion prior to the big day. The poster was a Yorkshire twist on the old Uncle Sam ‘your country needs you’ but we had a lady in rollers saying ‘your town needs you’. We were contacted by the local paper, councillors, celebs and radio and gave interviews to promote the event.
We had great weather on the Sunday and we arrived at 8am to set up 800 chairs (that were being stored up the hill on palettes with 150 chairs per palette!). We could not have done it without the staff that gave their Sunday. Rob West, Julie Sharman, Bev Buxton, James Ball, Louise Exley, Darren Rowe, Claire Gray and Lesley Dixon were just amazing! It was a long day with lots of heavy lifting but they all pulled together and made the whole thing possible. After we set the chairs out we set about recruiting people to take part. The volunteers that came to help as stewards did amazingly well at approaching people and asking them to take part. Susie, Gemma, Angie, Vicky, Jean and Margaret had big smiles all day long and thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
The attempt went well, people that took part loved it and really enjoyed Susie’s eclectic mix of golden oldie tracks. Unfortunately we didn’t break the record, but we did have 538 people take part with big smiles and lots of laughter. The feedback on social media and local news has been fantastic with people saying they will be back next year to try again – so watch this space!

Ruby, Kyra and Alex’s stories

Ruby, Kyra and Alex’s stories
Ruby (7) lives in Liverpool with her Mum, older sister Katie and young brother Albie. Ruby is adorably happy and bright and misses her dad every day. A family man, her Dad Michael is one of the lucky ones; he’s in a prison that is only a few miles from the family home. Ruby loves visiting her dad and, thanks to the prison actively encouraging strong family contact, gets to see her dad on regular family days and intensive parenting programmes.
On BBC One at 10.45pm on Tuesday 15th November a BBC One documentary produced by True Vision highlights Ruby’s story and our work with her within our Prisoner’s Children  Family Impact service. The film follows Ruby and her family in the lead up to the hearing and for the first time hear from her imprisoned father about his thoughts on his arrest and his views on the future and how his decisions have affected his children.
Alex (11) and Kyra (8) also live in Merseyside with their mum. Bright and bubbly, both girls lead happy lives but admit that they struggled when, despite his promises to ‘be on his best behaviour’, their dad was sent to prison for the second time not long after his first sentence. Kyra struggled at school and Alex didn’t know how to express her hurt – but fortunately both girls were able to get some help from a Children in Need funded support group run by PSS. The girls have also had one-to-one sessions and thanks to the support the sisters are coming to terms with their dad’s imprisonment and are encouraged to tell him how they feel. As their parents are separated they don’t often visit their dad, but with this support they are getting more confident.
With True Vision’s expertise in heartfelt and sensitive child-centred storytelling, together with ground breaking access and compelling and amazing characters, this film promises to lift the lid on this hidden population of prisoner’s children and will force many to question the meaning of punishment and think twice about those who are affected.
Catch our team on ‘Prison, My Parent and Me’ at 10.45pm on BBC One on Tuesday 15th November 2016, or catch it on iPlayer.

Award-winning PSS project features in BBC special film

Award-winning PSS project features in BBC special film
An award-winning Liverpool-based project run by social enterprise PSS that provides support to children with a parent in prison will feature in a special film being broadcast on BBC One this week.
The Family Impact project will be in the spotlight in a documentary for Children in Need called ‘Prison, My Parents and Me’ which will reveal what it’s really like to lose a parent to the criminal justice system.
More than 10,000 children visit a prison every week, but while their parent is on the inside, outside the children are often bullied and left feeling isolated and ostracised.
During the documentary BAFTA-nominated film-maker Catey Sexton provides an insight into the lives of those often lost in the system and reveals how prisoners’ children are twice as likely to suffer from poor mental health, while two out of three boys with a dad in prison will go on to offend themselves.
The film follows several children with a parent in prison including Alex, 11 and Kyra, eight. The sisters attend a support group run by PSS and are coming to terms with their dad’s imprisonment as they are encouraged to tell him how they feel.
Also featured is Ruby, seven, who is coming to terms with her dad’s recent arrest and worries he may never come home. He is serving time in Altcourse Prison in Liverpool, one of just a handful that actively encourages strong family contact in the hope of reducing re-offending.
Dr Lorna Brookes, PSS Family Impact practitioner who runs the project, said: “We are very encouraged that an issue we feel passionate about is getting the national recognition it deserves and it was terrific to work with the team at True Vision Productions.
“While there’s little government support for children with a parent in prison, there is a great need. By providing help and support early on, these young people can look forward to a bright future and avoid more serious issues for families further down the line.”
The Family Impact project, which receives BBC Children in Need funding, adopts a ‘whole family’ approach to ensure that support is offered to the child, their parent or carer and, where possible, the prisoner parent post-release.
It provides a range of support including what to tell the children about the imprisonment; one to one support for children to discuss their feelings and emotional wellbeing and peer group support for children where they can meet others who share their experience.
Project workers work in partnership with schools, prisons, probation and social services and take children on prison visits where there is no other suitable adult to do so. Prisoner parents are also offered support post-release to help them to re-integrate back into family and community life.
The BBC Children in Need Special, ‘Prison, My Parents and Me’ will be broadcast on BBC One, 10.45pm on Tuesday 15th November
Notes for Editors:
As an organisation we developed some of the best known names in community support including Age Concern, the Citizen’s Advice Bureau and Legal Aid. Today our team continues this legacy of innovation. We sit alongside local government and NHS services plugging the gaps and providing ‘on the ground’ support for a wide range of people.
Our aim is simple and has been at the heart of what we do for a long time: to make the lives of those we work with better. In the 21st century we have evolved this mission to highlight the importance of encouraging people to choose their own support. We recognise when people are in need and help them find new and practical ways to get the most out of life. To make this a reality we provide a range of services which work across a wide spectrum of personal experience and need.
We never give up on finding the right service for each individual we work with. If we don’t have a service currently to meet their needs, we develop one and that is why we’ve been around for nearly 100 years.

Feel Good Friday @ Women’s Turnaround

Feel Good Friday @ Women’s Turnaround
Each Friday Turnaround has a range of activities under the ‘feel good Friday’ banner. During August some of the women who had recently completed The Freedom project received a makeover from a professional makeup artist which left them feeling fab (just in time for the weekend).
What is The Freedom Project? Facilitator Tina Pomford tells us:
“It is a 12 week programme which covers different types of abuse: physical, emotional, financial and also the associated warning signs. In the group we also discuss domestic abuse and the effects of this on children and other family members. A few of the sessions I facilitate are ‘the bully’, ‘the headworker’ and ‘the persuader’. The women who attend are all at different stages, some have been abused in past, some are still in the relationship, some are living in hostels and we also have a range of age groups
I have facilitated this group for approximately 5 years. I can honestly say I am passionate about it and love to see the women transforming their lives (when the time is right for them).”

LivPIP DVD: sharing advice and real stories from new parents

LivPIP DVD: sharing advice and real stories from new parents
Our Liverpool Parent and Infant Partnership service (LivPIP) works in partnership with parents and other primary caregivers as they develop and learn to understand the relationship they have with their baby. Our team works with families both ante-natally and post-natally across Liverpool, including within Liverpool Women’s Hospital.
The team have recently created a DVD with production company first take, to capture the experiences of several Merseyside families through pregnancy, birth and the first few months of parenthood. As well as real stories, the DVD features expert advice and information from the infant psychotherapists and specialist practitioners who deliver the service.
“We work with parents and primary caregivers from the time they find out they’re pregnant right through to age two’ says Michael Galbraith, LivPIP Clinical Lead ‘Our aim is to help parent and baby build a happy strong, interactive relationship and enjoy each other’s company.”
“We want to show the different experiences that families have, as well as the common elements and similarities that all parents experience. For example we look at home births, experiences in the neo natal unit, breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding mothers etc. We think all parents will take something useful away from the DVD”
Over the next few months, parents attending booking appointments at Liverpool Women’s Hospital will be given a copy of the DVD along with information about LivPIP and other services in the city.
The DVD was funded by Liverpool City Council, Public Health who recognise how important this early stage of development is for both parent and baby:
“There is strong evidence that what happens in early childhood and the developing years’ impacts on health, well-being and life chances throughout life. As a city we are committed to ensuring that every child has the best start in life, a strong parent child relationship is one of the most important aspects of this. It is vital for a healthy and thriving future society”
You can find out more about LivPIP and how to get in touch with the team here.

Pam Doyle shortlisted for leadership award at Northern Enterprise Awards

Pam Doyle shortlisted for leadership award at Northern Enterprise Awards
Critical to a successful business is strong leadership. This award recognizes successful leaders who have either achieved growth through changed business behavior or successfully lobbied or campaigned on an issue which has brought about positive change.
‘Pam has worked for PSS for over 10 years and you might think that that sort of timescale would result in someone losing their passion or momentum in their work. Not with Pam, having been promoted to Head of Service for our Adult Services in 2014 Pam has taken them to a new level, guiding the team to take tremendous pride in what they do, develop themselves and give our service users the opportunities they deserve. The team want the best for people, they want our values lived and they show great pride in their work for PSS.
All of this is down to Pam’s championing of PSS core mission and values, showing strong commitment to having the right people on the bus (and making some very difficult decisions in the process) and using her strong understanding of people to help get some very deserving individuals promoted through the ranks and to provide strong operational support to bring in some fantastic new pieces of work.
Since Pam has been in post we have won a huge social investment piece of work in Manchester around Shared Lives, something Pam was willing to throw herself into. Pam’s can do attitude meant we didn’t sit and worry because we hadn’t done it before, but we assessed the risks and focused positively on how we could work with our social investors and the council to make it a success. Pam took the new Manchester team on this journey, keeping their spirits high during some really challenging periods of early setup. Last year we won the contract to deliver Liverpool’s Adult Day Centres. Within a matter of weeks Pam recruited over 70 staff and the values of those individuals have shone through.
She’s led people through the principles of ‘Lead Like Mary’, a leadership programme which she has had all her Team Leaders educated on and she has mentored junior members of staff to encourage their self-belief about going for new roles in the organisation. Last but by no means least Pam’s ability to model behaviour is second to none and our adult services teams across the North West are showing a passion, drive and excitement for the future that in all honesty had started to flag as the cuts started to take hold. The team now see the opportunities in the funding restrictions and not just the threats.’

The Ruby Project shortlisted for Innovation Award at Northern Enterprise Awards



 
October 13, 2016
Eleanor Riley
The Ruby Project shortlisted for Innovation Award at Northern Enterprise Awards
This award celebrates socially conscious organisations, which use creative solutions/innovation in the business model/project design to deliver social impact.
‘Kim Worthington and Heather Bromilow are core members of our team at the Liverpool Women’s Turnaround Centre, where PSS provide support to women who are involved in the criminal justice system. Of course, the lives of these women is often not as simple as purely having a criminal background, and many are themselves victims of crime, namely emotional and physical abuse at the hands of partners. 
With a background in domestic violence services before joining the PSS team Heather and Kim came to notice the multiple occasions on which women were presenting at the Royal Hospital and not hitting the threshold for local services and therefore not being identified as ‘at risk’. Having spoken to Dave Roberts the Head of Safeguarding at the Royal the team decided to write a proposal for a service which would address this gap by providing detailed training to front-line NHS staff in A&E and an on-call referral service for those staff to get immediate support for them women ideally whilst they are still on site. 
The service was awarded Comic Relief funding and its success and great outcomes around reducing re-attendance at the hospital’s A&E department has resulted in further funding being awarded for Aintree hospital through the Big Lottery Fund. The team are also in talks with the Women’s hospital and hospital’s in other areas of the North West beyond the Liverpool City Region. Many in the sector have praised the way Heather and Kim completed a 3 month pilot with minimal funding and have now obtained nearly £200k worth of ongoing funding for the service with more to come. Their commitment to make identification of Domestic Violence a priority and meet the women where they are at their moment of need has resulted in approaches from across the NHS and the use of the service as an example of best practice on a local and national level.’

Young Carers Get Animated

Young Carers Get Animated
Over the past few weeks Sefton Young Carers have been working with Collective Encounters to create a short animated film that tells their stories. The films will be sent out to schools to represent the lives of the young carers and what they do and to raise awareness about what it’s like to be a young carer.
The session is ran by Ben and Annie who start each week with a set of fun and interactive games to make everyone feel comfortable and engaged.
The session then moves on to an exercise on story structures with the characters the group have already created in previous weeks. Then, it’s time for a pizza break!
After the break the young people pick up the session. They agree on a script by breaking into groups of 3 to write a couple of lines each.
They all really enjoy their sessions, and one of the young carers Jordan told us that doing activities with other young carers is “a laugh and has so much variety, we had coaches from Everton come in an teach us football a few weeks ago and now we have Ben and Annie doing animation” whilst Oliva says “it’s a relaxing break from home where no one judges you it feels like a night off and we feel closer to each other here”
Ben and Annie added “it’s brilliant to see the kids of all different ages and all different backgrounds connecting with each other. They’re building a story without much input from us, it’s amazing”
Keep your eye out in the near future for the young carers winning a BAFTA!

Weight to go Dave!!

Weight to go Dave!!
You may remember back in 2014 we reported that Dave was adapting a new healthy lifestyle and had joined Slimming World and was loving it. Well, two years on and he’s still going strong. The Wales team tell us about the progress he’s made.
When Dave entered his adult placement he was 15 stone 4 lbs which was partly due to a thyroid problem. He began to feel his weight having an effect on his lifestyle when he became breathless whilst walking and dancing, which are two of his favourite activities. Dave is a fashion conscious self-confessed ladies man and says that he wanted to get a six-pack to impress the ladies and be able to buy more fashionable clothing which were unavailable in his original size.
 He attended slimming world but initially felt that it was not for him. He recalls with great humour that it was an incident in college 6 months later that led to his resolve to attend slimming world again.
 The incident happened on a fancy dress day in college where he had gone dressed as a captain and his pants split, this resulted in him having to walk backwards for the rest of the afternoon due to his dark underwear. Since attending slimming world for the second time nearly three years ago, Dave has gone regularly and has gained a whole host of certificates and awards. 
These include:
A bronze weight loss award
A silver weight loss award
A gold weight loss award
A platinum weight loss award
A slimmer of the month certificate
Three slimmer of the week certificates
Two ‘Mr Sleek’ awards
A ‘Man of the Year’ award
A 10% weight loss award
Additional to this Dave has now received his ‘Free lifetime membership’ after reaching his target weight of 10 stone 3lbs.
Dave remains an active member and a big part of the slimming world group. He regularly brings various low fat foods in which the slimming world group plan what meals they could make from the ingredients Dave brings in. Dave also educates the other people in his household about healthy eating which has also resulted in weight loss for his co-tenants and carer.
 This has increased Dave’s confidence and independence at home as he now helps with the shopping and checks all the fat and protein contents of all the food in the house. Occasionally the house will have a treat such as a takeaway or a pudding, however this is very rare as he is conscious of continuing with his weight loss and does not want to begin gaining weight again. Dave also continues to keep his weight loss up by doing weights in his bedroom and chins on his chin bar, alongside going to the gym, long walks and dancing all night.
Way to go Dave! You are an inspiration to us all! xx

Superhero Day

Superhero Day
If you had visited Making Days North on Friday 8th May, you may well have wondered what was going on!
Staff and Service users had transformed the centre into a superhero training academy raising money for the expansion of child bereavement facilities at Zoë’s Place Baby Hospice in Liverpool.
Zoё’s Place is a baby charity that provides palliative, respite and end-of-life care to babies and infants aged from birth to five years old suffering from life-limiting or life-threatening conditions.
Zoё’s Place Baby Hospices are the only baby specific hospices in the U.K. Liverpool was the first Zoё’s Place to be opened in 1995. Zoё’s Place can take up to six infants at any one time, providing care on a one-to-one basis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They have accommodation and facilities for the whole family to stay if needed.
When the trainees arrived at the academy they were met by Spiderwoman – Alice, who checked their identities at the door before letting them in. Once inside the trainees met their Team Leaders – Kyle, Cath. Julie, Linda and Gill, who guided them through the different areas of their training.
Graduates from the academy – Sue, Anthony, Suzanne, Karen, Frank, Pam, were on hand at each activity to lend support and encouragement to the trainees as they battled with The Web, Thors Hammer, Batman Bowling and The Captain V’s Iron Man.
After a well-earned buffet lunch, trainees battled against each other in a game of Superhero Bingo. Super Tess, A.K.A Tessa Dunbavin, manager and veteran of the academy, did a magnificent job as bingo caller.
A disco and awards ceremony rounded off the fabulous day. Every trainee had their efforts rewarded with a certificate which was presented by Super Tess.
A huge thank you to all the staff and service users at Making Days North for their help and support in making Superhero Day so special and raising a whopping £110

This is US! Making Days North

This is US! Making Days North
Although we’re small we pack a real punch here at Making Days North. Things have changed a fair bit over the last six months. Gone are the peach chairs and in their place comfy couches and bean bags. A new staff team are in place, recruited because we all share the same values as PSS.
We’ve had positive feedback from parents/carers in the Keeping in Touch meetings, and members of the public that we have met especially on our visit to the museum. We’ve made real strides with service users who have more complex needs, with regular trips swimming, the City farm, Walton Hall Park and Crosby beach.
Centre based activities have had a revamp and we now have an activities coordinator who will continue to improve and expand what we offer. The Gardening group now have their own space, complete with greenhouse, where they can grow a variety of plants.
The art groups have completed a variety of projects. In February they studied American artist Jim Dine and his famous heart paintings. The art groups produced fabulous props and posters for Superhero day.
There is always a rather nice aroma in the centre on Friday mornings. The cookery group have been Around the World, finding out about different countries and their foods. Yum!
The drama group is in the midst of preparing for the talent show where the audience will be entertained by a hypnotist, the phantom from phantom of the opera and wheelchair dancing to name but a few.
Recently team leaders have moved to a larger office on the 1st floor and have been joined by the lovely Community support team. The old office is in the process of being decorated and will be the new meet and greet room.
Overseeing all these positive changes has been Tessa Dunbavin, superhero, Liverpool supporter and fearless leader.
So that’s us, Making Days North.

Making Music at Making Days: South

Making Music at Making Days: South
By Debbie Hodges  who attends Making Days: South, with support from staff member Emma Bannon.
Today is concert day at Making Days South. Everybody involved are so happy and full of fun this morning. We are having a rehearsal to make sure our performance is the best it can be. The atmosphere is electric and you can feel how excited everybody is. 
Rehearsal is very loud, there are songs being sung and instruments being played, the room is filled with sunshine coming through the window. All our groups practised their performances with determination and pride. We also had to organise our decorations. We made all of these ourselves in our art groups and our spare time over several weeks. We made flowers with paper tissues and wooden sticks, our floristry tutor Jane helped us arrange these. The Spanish bunting was made from fabric and we cut these out and glued different colours together. We made Spanish flags also from card. The group designed and made our own order of service cards. 
It is just before lunch and we are all resting our voices. We used this time to take our decorations down to the hall at Bridge Chapel. Here with support from our staff we are decorating the stage. We also have to set up tea, coffee, fruit, pastries, and biscuits for our audience on the tables. 
We have had lunch early and made our way down to the hall to meet our music tutor Will. 
Parents and Carers started to arrive and we all assembled in our sections for our performances. 
The performance started with an introduction about the concert and all the work that had gone into making this happen. 
Order of service was as follows: 
Folk Choir-You Are My Sunshine
Nicholas Crowe- She’ll Be Coming Round the Mountain
Marlene Vines- Hey Jude
Spanish Group- Hola a Todos (Spanish Greeting Song)
Making Days Choir: Living Doll, 8 Days A Week, Summer Holiday
And a special version of You’ll Never Walk Alone which was dedicated to the families of those that lost loved ones at Hillsborough on service users requests. 
The concert itself ran perfectly and everybody was really proud, the folk group got the party started the soloists were so confident and pitch perfect at every verse. The choir ended the concert on a fabulous high note. While the Spanish group added a touch of flare and culture in-between. 
Our other friends came down to support us in the audience and they were singing along and dancing some of them even joined us on the stage at the end. It was so lovely to see all our hard work and effort pay off. Parents and Carers were taking photographs, recording videos, clapping cheering and singing along. Some of us found it very emotional and overwhelming with the responses we got from our audience. We loved it.  Our close friend Marilyn Bracey came and visited too, she had to unfortunately leave the service, so it was beautiful to see her sitting on the front row supporting us all. 
As much as we all worked together as friends and with our tutors to make our performance perfect, our support staff over nearly 2months gave us lots of confidence, encouragement and guidance with all the elements of the concert. They supported us to bring our ideas to life and were always there when we needed them even when we were nervous during our performance they were right behind us on the stage with encouraging words and calmed our nerves. 
The end of the concert Pam Doyle gave a speech thanking us all for our performances and a thank you to everybody who attended in the audience.
After the concert we chatted with our friends, our family and carers before re-joining all our other friends and staff back in our day service. It was a beautiful end to our day.

Person Shaped Placement: Our 70 Day with PSS

Person Shaped Placement: Our 70 Day with PSS
Hi we are Lisa and Paula, two Liverpool City Council employment based students from UCLAN University who came to PSS to complete a 70day social work adult placement.
Having 26 years’ experience between us of working within Liverpool City Council Children’s Services we felt a little out of our comfort zone, having never worked within an adult social care organisation. We were reassured it is the same skill set and value base and introduced to the task ahead. 
Working directly with the Head of Service for the Home & Communities Portfolio, Pam Doyle to review and embed Personal Centred Support Planning & Practices across services.
The 70 day Challenge was…….
•	To design and create a generic person centred support plan template
•	Develop and deliver training to 30 support staff and team leaders
•	Provide 1:1 support and mentoring to support staff in completing over 200 support plans 
We actioned this in 3 stages.
1.	Planning. We researched relevant theory & legislation. Having met the service managers to gain understanding of the services in the Homes and Communities portfolio we then visited services and spent time with service users. We had meetings and conversations with people who receive support and the staff who provide the support, to increase ownership, commitment and motivation to a change in culture with greater focus on person centred support. Looking at new innovative ways to complete Personal Centred Support Plans.
2.	Design. We designed a new support planning tool to create new person centred support plans. We then realised that to promote quality it would be helpful for staff to have clear guidance on how to complete the plan so we wrote a guidance book to compliment and ensure high standards. 
3.	Implementation. This stage developed into a real team effort, Pam Doyle brought together the heads of services and Karol Zwolinski to meet with the managers of the Day services to discuss the new support plan role out. Our role in this was to provide training to all support staff and team leaders over a two week period then to provide four weeks direct support at the day centres to oversee the completion of the support plans. 
We are grateful for the time we have spent at PSS as it has been amazing!
As students our learning experience has far exceeded our expectation and we are thankful for the unique opportunity we were given.
We have learnt so much from PSS service users and families and been inspired by the dedication and hard work of PSS staff who it has been a privilege and a pleasure to spend time with. We would particularly like to thank Pam Doyle and Pam Foy who have been fantastic mentors throughout our placement.  
Karol Zwolinski worked closely with Lisa and Paula on this project: 
I have had a pleasure to work alongside of Lisa and Paula on a pilot project for new support plans roll out across our Making Days services. This unique however how significant opportunity given to both students, will have a significant impact on the future of our work. 
In true PSS style both Lisa and Paula were nothing more than positive, enthusiastic and solution focus.  I look forward to working with them as I believe they will help to shape future of Health and Social Care services. Good luck with everything you do!!!

‘What would Paddy do?’- PSS project worker Paddy Morton nominated for national award.



 
July 26, 2016
Eleanor Riley
‘What would Paddy do?’- PSS project worker Paddy Morton nominated for national award.
Earlier this year Jon, who uses our Wellbeing Centres, nominated Project Worker Paddy Morton (centre on the pic above)  for an All in the Mind Award. Paddy made it to the second round of these highlight competitive awards, here is the nomination Jon submitted.
‘I honestly believe that Paddy is the most able mental health professional I have ever worked with. He’s been supporting me on courses, in 1-1 sessions and on the phone since 2003. He always responds to whatever I say, is never phased and appears un-shockable.
I have suffered mental health problems all my life. I remember desperately waiting to join in with games in the school playground but not being asked. I had very few friends during childhood. Aged 10 I had withdrawn from the playground as much as possible to escape bullying. By then I was dogged with the sleeplessness, agoraphobia, communication problems that have hounded me all my whole life.
Of course my insularity was the result of the terrible home life I suffered. My mum was a classical abuser, showing her best face to the outside world and her worst to me. My father disappeared when I was 5, he was Bengali. I was raised by my whole family with no mention of my Indian heritage, identity problems followed as surely as night follows day.
Childhood withdrawal led to teenage instability, my first bi-polar episode appeared when I changed schools at 16 and again when I started University at 18, My first major manic episode resulted in me being sectioned at 28 and diagnosed with bi-polar.
It was after hospital that I first met Paddy by joining an anger management course he was delivering at PSS Umbrella Centre. I was experiencing constant violent fantasies of attacking people. I think it was the first time I saw a practical model and how to apply it to my own situation. I was struck by Paddy’s patience and ability to respond to anything that the participants said. I noticed an improvement in my internal anger and was now able to monitor and counter it by using techniques Paddy had taught.
In 2009 my mum died and I experienced many recovered memories and I suffered a severe mental breakdown narrowly avoiding being sectioned due to an exgirlfriends support. I returned to the Umbrella Centre and Paddy supported me to attend an anxiety management course. Of course you don’t overcome a lifetimes trauma in 7 weeks, no matter how good the teachers are! That was when I started seeing Paddy regularly, first on a weekly basis and now on a monthly basis.
It’s hard to sum up how much Paddy has helped me, from the basics of anxiety and stress management, breathing and visualisation techniques, assertiveness to Gestalt psychology, yoga and energy work. We have talked in the centre and he has accompanied me on walks around Liverpool to help me with my anxiety, agoraphobia and social phobia.
He is pragmatic, approachable, caring and down to earth. A true stereotypical salt of the earth scouser! I don’t know where I’d be without Paddy and The Umbrella Centre. He/they have been a lifeline for me over the years. Sometimes when I don’t know how to cope I think, What would Paddy say?’

Margaret’s Shared Lives story



 
July 26, 2016

Margaret’s Shared Lives story
You may recognise Margaret from the Shared Lives video that is on their page,here she reflects on her time working with the service.
First let me say I have been working for adult placements for 12 year and I have enjoyed every day.
I came to work for adult placements after an event I have attended in the village by mere chance, I popped in to the scheme and never looked back.
I went on a training course and also had to go through panel in order to formally be able to be a Shared Lives (at the time Adult Placement) carer.
I am now supporting four service users within a spectrum of varied ages. My service users are people who come from varied backgrounds and therefore they like doing different things, so our days always vary.
Some of them like shopping, garden centres, cooking and learning life-long skills, and some enjoy looking at the ‘’bird tree’’ at Cannock Chace. Eating out at pubs or staying in and me cooking a nice meal at my place. Others enjoy taking craft classes and doing crafts or attending the gym. Whatever activities they prefer doing, I am always willing to find information about what is going on in our area and enable my service users to attend.
Some service users, need to book or attend Doctors, nurses, dentists etc appointments, I will always make myself available for those appointments and be flexible in order to accommodate the service user’s needs, as in life we all have to change sometimes. 
Working for adult placement services has also changed my life, I enjoy the working hours and I find it very satisfactory to be and support service users who enjoy my company as much as I enjoy their company which I believe is a cornerstone for a good placement.
I have always felt that I have been fully supported by adult placement services and especially by Shared Lives, there is always someone there to help and provide support and advice when needed and sometimes we all need that extra bit of advice in life.
There is also an out of hour’s service available which I have used and as always there is someone there to pick up the phone and provide advice and support.
Training is always enjoyable and gives me the opportunity to converse with other carers and also ensure that we are up to date with the requirements and demands of our role.

Mitch takes the express train to a new career



 
July 25, 2016
Conor Anderson
Mitch takes the express train to a new career
Mitchell (or Mitch as he prefers to be called) is a 21 year old man living with his carers, Linda & John Frost, since the age of nine. At the time they were foster carers but Linda and John wanted to continue supporting him as an adult so they transitioned with him to become PSS Midlands Shared Lives Carers.
Throughout his life Mitchell has experienced first-hand how it feels to face barrier after barrier and the disappointment of having people telling him, ‘you cannot achieve things others find ordinary’ or being excluded from every-day regular activities just because people had no understanding of his condition and how to approach him, and not enough patience in order to adjust means, resources, explanations, processes etc in order for Mitch to feel and be included.
Nevertheless Linda & John would just ‘’ Not have it’’, every time a barrier was there for Mitch they would also be there to help him find a way around it. Mitch’s dream since childhood was to work at the railway and here is his story as he has expressed it himself:
‘’Hi my name is Mitchell Grant.
I have lived with Linda and John Frost for 11 years, I was in foster care. I wanted to stay with Linda and John when I reached 18 years old I then moved over to PSS and happily stay with Linda and John.
Since the age of 8 I have always wanted to work with the railway, I love trains I have always told Linda and John how much I love trains, I would love one day to work on them.
Linda and John have always listened to this I did tell school and College but I get kept getting told I couldn’t do it for health and safety reasons because I have a learning difficulty. Linda and John did not settle for this and said that I should have the same chance and choice as anyone else should, so they contacted the careers officer, she came to see us all and said she had heard of volunteering at Kindsgrove station, she promised that she would talk to them and see if it is possible for me to do that. She got back to us after a week and said yes they were willing for me to go there and she even offered to support me there for the first few weeks.
I then got spotted by East midlands train’s manager because I was doing that well and there was a pilot scheme coming up, which started September 4th to October 4th , the pilot scheme was to get people with special needs to come into the railway industry and we achieved that over the next four weeks. The manager also said a couple of weeks ago, that there are 2 new people waiting to start work there now, both with learning difficulties.
A couple of months after I finished that training I had a phone call saying there was a Saturday job at Sheffield, doing train cleaning 9-5 and it was mine if I wanted it, so I said yes and I have been doing it every Saturday since December the 7th 2015. They said in a years’ time I could be working on board, doing on board stuff such as cleaning tables and taking cups.
I have achieved this with determination from myself and support from Linda and John, they said if I had a dream, ‘’I should go for it’’ so I did, and they supported me all the way
This was Mitch’s touching story, a story which comes to prove that our service user’s get the individualised support they need in order to achieve their dreams on the road for independent living.
From every one of us in PSS, a very big ‘well done’ to Mitch for his resilience, dedication and determination to make his dream come true and a very big well done to his carers Linda and John for giving him all the support and guidance in order to make his dream reality…

“This is something I’ve always wanted to do”



 
July 22, 2016
Conor Anderson
“This is something I’ve always wanted to do”
Karen Phillips on her journey from the home office to PND Specialist practitioner and how volunteering helped her achieve her dream.
Working with women in the perinatal period is something I’d always been drawn to. After my own experience with PND having my own children, I always thought I’d love to be able to go and help mums suffering with it because it’s support I never had. I worked in the home office for years and had a good job and a family. I was never in a position to just pack my job in and go to University to get into social work.
I thought I couldn’t just leave my job and the security it brings. Then like fate really, I got made redundant! So I thought well I can go and do some voluntary work for now and that was the start of it. I just threw myself in, I loved the work and everything that I got out of it.
After about a year of volunteering a paid role become available for a pilot of the PND service in Macclesfield. During my voluntary work I had completed all my training and my level 1 and level 2 counselling so I went for it… and it got it! The position was only for 12 weeks but it was right out of my comfort zone. I didn’t know anyone within the area, so again I just threw myself in to it and thought ‘right, I can do this!’ and I did everything I could working in the specialist practitioner role.
When I came back to the Liverpool team I felt like I had proved myself and PSS offered me a role here. It was just temporary at this stage (for as long as the budget allowed) so my contract was extended once or twice. Then this year a more permanent role came up so it’s all just led up to this.
I never take it for granted because I know so many people would love this role, and I know I don’t have the degree back ground. It’s basically life skills and personal experiences that make me a good specialist practitioner and feel like I can relate to these mums. I’m starting my level 3 counselling next month so it’s just getting better and better. I can’t see myself going anywhere now, I think you’d have to frog march me out of here to leave!
I feel lucky to be part of this team…
Firstly for this service in particular, the team are amazing. They are so supportive even if you’re having a wobble some days there’s always someone there. They give you advice or point you in the right direction but the main thing is they just make you feel like one of the team. I never felt lesser being a volunteer, I always felt I was on the same level. They welcomed me from the start. Without their support I don’t know if I’d have stuck at my role, I was intimidated to begin with but they put me at ease.
Now, if I hear of anyone wanting to do voluntary work I always suggest PSS because of the support I’ve had here. Even with Lesley Dixon, she’s always treated me as one of the workers and always goes out of her way to chat. I used to always say ‘I’m just a volunteer’ and I used to get told off for saying it because volunteers are viewed as important at PSS too. Whenever I say to People I work at PSS they say: ‘Oh how did you get in there??, lots of people want to work here.
I love coming into work…
I never thought volunteering would lead to a paid role so soon. I just know I’m meant to do this. The work makes me feel alive- I love coming to work! When a visit goes well I ring Jo in the office and say ‘I love this job!’ just because by doing it you’re making someone’s life better and that feels amazing. Equally it can be hard because some people don’t respond to what you’re doing and you have to try different approaches.
One of the mums I’ve been working with has just started doing voluntary work at a children’s centre after I encouraged her. It’s a different route into work especially if you can’t afford university. Plus, with my life experience I felt like I was half way there. When I was sick after having my babies all I wanted was for someone to sit with me and normalise it and say ‘look, you’re not mad, you’re just going through something’ It makes me so happy that I get to do that for other new mums now.
Feedback from some of the women Karen has supported:
‘I have just been for a walk and thought about everything that’s happened and I just wanted to tell you how blessed I feel to have met you. I will never be able to thank you enough for everything you have done for me and my boys- I truly believe you’ve been our angel.’
‘Every day I hear you telling me ‘you can do this’ and it helps me so much, thanks for all of your support’

Happy Birthday Shared Lives Manchester!
“At Shared Lives Manchester we are fast approaching our first birthday and it is amazing to see how far we have come in the last 12 months. You can see from our recent quarterly carers meeting that we are progressing well and we have recruited some amazing carers. It has been a tough year but all three of us at Manchester are working our socks off to ensure that our second year is even better than the first!”

A Day In The Life… Kyle Dennis

A Day In The Life… Kyle Dennis
1 year into Shared Lives Manchester Kyle Denis shares a typical day in his role as Service Co-ordinator.
06:30 – I manage to roll myself out of bed and into the shower, half dazed and still asleep. I manage to force some breakfast (I really hate breakfast) and make a very strong coffee.
07:30 – I start my commute to Manchester from the Wirral via our wonderful UK rail services. (I regularly do battle with men in suits for the last un-reserved seat. I usually win..)
08:50- Power walk time from Manchester Victoria to our office at the LGBT foundation.. (Got to hit my 10,000 steps!)
09:10 – land at my desk and see what awaits me in my inbox!
09:30 – (On this particular day) I grab my promotional materials and head for the bus to the job centre in Cheetham Hill. But sometimes I’m preparing for jobs fairs, recruitment events or carer visits!
10:00 – Engage my inner charmer to talk to as many people as possible and find us some new Shared Lives carers.
13:00 – Arrive back at our office on Canal Street and catch up with the team about any new service user referrals and any updates from our carers!
13:30 – Lunch time is an opportunity for me to get out an explore Manchester. I usually take a quick walk and see how far I can get and then try frantically to remember my way back when I get distracted by something interesting (most recently this was an epic grilled cheese sandwich bar!).
14:00 – I proudly survey my elaborate (really simple) database systems that house every conceivable piece of information you may require. I also check out carer files to see if everything is in order and up to date.
15:00 – I follow up on any outstanding expressions of interest and organise appointments for myself and my colleagues to go and meet new carers. (I love meeting new carers! It is one of my favourite parts of the job I do!)
17:10 – Pack up, lock up, say goodbye to the staff at the LGBT foundation and prepare myself for the journey home!
17:30 – I always bring my camera to work with me so I can take some pictures in the city on my way to the train station. (I’m a shameless instagrammer)
19:00 – I arrive home. Eat food, start editing my photos from the day and watch some Buzzfeed on youtube!
22:00 – Bed..

Choose what works for you- Be Well Barnsley offers tailor made support.





July 19, 2016

Choose what works for you- Be Well Barnsley offers tailor made support.
The Be Well team share two success stories from the first 6 months of the service.
Cynthia goes from strength to strength
 ‘When Cynthia first came to me she explained she wanted to start an exercise programme that would improve mobility and overall fitness. She’d been very active a few years ago but after several health problems she had stopped it all. She’d lost all her confidence and was very nervous and reluctant to even attempt any form of exercise.
I managed to put her mind at ease by explaining that the exercise programme we would undertake wouldn’t hurt or harm her and that it would greatly improve her quality of life.  After discussing several options we agreed she would benefit from joining a Pilates class that I had started. 
Over the weeks we covered many different forms of exercise including Callanetics, Pilates, tai chi and resistance training with Dyno bands. Cynthia also picked up many different exercises that she could complete at home that would greatly improve her overall health.
Over the weeks I have seen a significant improvement in her mobility and flexibility, she also as gained strength and her overall health as improved greatly. Apart from all the tremendous physical improvements I have observed in Cynthia’s health I have also witnessed a complete turnaround in Cynthia’s confidence and a new found zest for life.
The Cynthia I know now is a healthier, happy person who is now leading a productive confident life. She determined to help others in her community to achieve the same levels of improvement and confidence that she has reached herself.
Cynthia has now become the chairperson for the Pilates group I started which has grown from 6 people to 26 people taking part every week. The group now not only helps to improve people’s health but also provides a friendly comfortable base for people to meet and organise other social activities. 
The group has become the pilot for the FIT4EVER classes that we run as part of the BE WELL BARNSLEY project that we intend to run throughout the region. The FIT4EVER class continues to attract more people and to greatly improve the lives of the people in Dearne. This is due to the continuous hard work that Cynthia and the other original members of the group put in on a weekly basis. 
Cynthia is also training to take over the delivery of the chair based exercise program, so she can help others with their mobility and becoming active. 
I’m so proud of Cynthia’s journey and it’s a great example of how lifestyle changes can’t be ‘one size fits all’ and people have to choose what works for them.’
George uses a holiday as motivation 
George, 78, accessed the service through his GP surgery for help with losing weight.  His BMI was in the obese category and he understood how this could have an impact on his future health.
George leads a very active and full life, he travels often and had a cruise planned with a friend which he hoped he would be able to lose weight for.  His friend was also accessing weight loss services so they were able to share their experiences and spur each other on to meet their goals.  
George attended weekly appointments with a Be Well Advisor at his GPs surgery.  For the first 6 weeks George completed food diaries which he would bring back to his appointments for us to review together and identify improvements he could make and set weekly goals to achieve this.   As well as working on a healthier diet he also set himself goals around his daily exercise and challenged himself to increase the amount he could do over the 12 weeks
George lost a total of 8.8 kg and his BMI went from the obese category into the overweight category.  He is still committed to his weight loss and attends monthly reviews.  At his most recent review he has managed to maintain his weight loss which is a great achievement as he has been on an all-inclusive cruise. 
What George says: “I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the Be Well service and have looked forward to my weekly appointments.  I am extremely pleased with the progress I have made and I am proud of my weight loss.  
The new healthy habits I have taken up are easy to maintain and I am enjoying my new healthier lifestyle. I’m going to continue working towards losing more weight and I am looking forward to a healthy future with many more travel plans.  My friend is still a bit miffed how I’ve managed to do a lot better than her! My motto when I go on my travels is “I don’t have to eat it just because it’s there”.

Play video games to help Dementia research? Sign us up!
Dementia awareness week was held between 15th May- 22nd May and so the MI team thought it would be great to take this opportunity to spread awareness and help the research in to Dementia by hosting a game-a-thon here at PSS Seel street.
The game-a-thon was based on a new App Sea Hero Quest which allows players to navigate the high seas while spotting mysterious monsters. By understanding how people steer around their environment, scientists hopes to pin down how spatial navigation goes wrong in Alzheimer’s disease. Playing just 2 minutes will contribute to over 5 hours’ worth of research in the lab.
We were pleased that we were able to attract over 30 people of all ages attended including our very own Wendy from Shared Lives, who we had never seen so quiet when she was gaming! Everybody had a competitive but brilliant time which contributed to total of 651 hours of research in a lab which is absolutely fantastic!!
Not only did we have gaming fun but the participants were also provided with healthy fruit and vegetables juices made by Karol (in healthy body healthy mind). We also had some pizza in for the more adventurous gamers
Karol and Sinead from the MI team both agreed it was a fantastic event from start to finish with lots of people contributing to Dementia research but also learning more about Dementia with the MI Teams ‘top 100 things you didn’t know about Dementia’ scattered around the tables for people to read and find more information about the illness.
The overall winner from the Game-a-thon was Thomas Stanley from Finance but I think you’ll agree when I say the real winners are the researches as we have given them over 3 weeks of research.
If you wish to contribute towards the research you can download the Sea Hearo Quest from the app store.
Game-a thon to be continued so watch the space…

Georgia Smith- Sporting Chance



 
July 14, 2016
Conor Anderson
Georgia Smith- Sporting Chance
Community Support worker Georgia Smith has grown up around horses, and has one of her own at a local stables. After she told several of the people she supports about her hobby, they expressed an interest and she decided to take them to the stables to show them what looking after horses was all about.
Georgia told us: ‘they groom horses, muck out, wash, clean them and the stables, they love it! They all ask to go each week, they love to take part in life at the stables.’
In fact, one lady who attended with Georgia took on a more formal volunteer role at the stables and as now started horse riding lessons.
Georgia shared her passion with the people she supports and has helped several of them to awaken a new interest. Introducing them to the equestrian world has helped them to develop confidence, with some able to take on more advanced duties now that they’ve learned the basics of how to care for animals properly. It’s also an innovative way of promoting physical activity, as caring for horses is quite physically demanding.
Inviting people she supports to visit the stables shows the bond that Georgia has built with these individuals, her commitment to expanding their horizons and showing them a range of new activities. It shows she’s not content to let them do the same thing all the time, and that she cares about their physical wellbeing and their development. Horse riding is a pursuit that is out of reach to many people, and PSS are proud that Georgia is making it possible for the people we support to enjoy this sport while receiving support from an expert like herself.

PSS staff treat their shelves to new books at Keeley’s book sale
Keeley, who we support, held a book sale this week at our Seel Street offices to raise money for Zoës Place Baby Hospice. Keeley had a large range of books on sale from Harry Potter to Ricky Tomlinson and everything in between, there was something for everyone. All books had been donated by PSS staff and visitors to the building over the last few weeks.
Keeley was so enthusiastic and excited about the book sale and she greeted everyone who attended with a big smile and a helped each person to choose a book. With help from her friend Katie, she managed to raise £92.50 in just a couple of hours.
“I’m so proud” said Keeley who was filled with joy when the money was counted. Keeley immediately phoned her mum to tell her the good news. Zoës Place were equally as pleased at the success of Keeley’s book sale, tweeting PSS with “Well done Keeley and thank you so much for all your support”.

Service Manager Claire Tells Us About Be Well…



 
March 18, 2016
Conor Anderson
Service Manager Claire Tells Us About Be Well…
Since November 2011 PSS have delivered the Barnsley Health Trainer Service for anybody 16+ who wanted to make a healthy lifestyle change. Health Trainers focused on using behaviour change techniques to set small goals working towards their bigger lifestyle goal e.g. losing weight, stopping smoking, becoming more active.In November 2015 a new integrated wellbeing service ‘Be Well Barnsley’ was tendered for and won by PSS. This brought together Stop Smoking Service, Weight Management Service and Health Trainers under one umbrella a one stop shop for support. PSS are the lead provider and South West Yorkshire Foundation Trust (SWYFT) are our delivery partner for stop smoking. Commissioners wanted a range of interventions delivered with innovation for the new service. The changes mean we now have new targets and areas of responsibility locally in Barnsley including; children and family healthy eating and healthy weight support; adult weight management; and stopping smoking in pregnancy. As part of the re-brand of the service, we re-named Health Trainers ‘Be Well Advisors’, although their role remains the same just with some new areas they are now delivering including 12 rolling programme of weight loss groups called ‘Choose 2 Lose’. We also carried out important insight which helped guide our new service with valuable feedback. Findings were that people wanted us to: provide information people can trust and rely on, give people time given to talk through the challenges they face, how they don’t just want to be healthier but also enjoy life more, support tailored for them and marketing materials using real people, from this we came up with the Be Well Barnsley strapline: ‘Choose What Works For You.’ We now have a central hub which is a shop front location in Barnsley Town Centre where we sit alongside SWYFT staff and have a new 0800 number, helping us with our seamless referral pathway and making it as easy as possible for local people to access support. Although we are now not commissioned to deliver physical activity groups as before, we have been able to sustain these through the support of our Health Champions up skilling them to deliver and run these groups within their communities. We now focus on supporting local people to achieve a 3 – 5 % weight loss and
engaging women in pregnancy. This means we are still able to deliver our award winning tailored programmes such as Fit Reds, Fit Me and Fit Mums.Although we know this will be a challenge, things are heading in the right direction and In January 2016 we had a 72% increase in referrals compared to December. For more information check our Facebook (BeWellBarnsley) or our website and currently developing our new website www.bewell-barnsley.com We’re planning to develop this to be an interactive digital portal to access self-help tools.

A Day In The Life Of Darren Rowe
BE WELL Advisor, Barnsley
06:00 My alarm goes off. Time to get up. I have a very busy day in front of me. Always start the day with some good stretchers to get my joints working correctly. Make myself some breakfast, usually porridge with blueberries in (very important meal). It fires me up for the training session I am about to do. Always catch up with the news to see what is happening in the world.
07:30 Arrive at the local gym. Catch up with two of the gym instructors who are friends of mine. Start my training session, it’s my favourite today as it’s arms day. Hit the weights for half an hour then jump on the treadmill for a half hour run. Get a shower then it’s off to work.
09:00 Arrive at the Dearne office. Catch up with my team leader Suzanne then I check my emails. After that I plan my Pilates session out that I am going to deliver and collect any equipment and music  =that I am going to use.
10:00 Arrive at the Pilates class I run. It’s a really popular class. I really enjoy teaching Pilates as its great exercise for all abilities and it’s nice to see how far my clients have improved with their health and mobility in such a short amount of time.
11:30 I meet up with my colleague Debbie and we plan and discuss our BE WELL weigh loss group that we are going to deliver this afternoon. Today we are covering good and bad fats. We then review the clients that are attending the group and talk about the different ways we can help them achieve their goals.
12:30 Lunch time. I am having a Tuna wholemeal sandwich and while I am eating this I catch up with a bit of work I need to do on the database.
14:00 Debbie and I turn up to deliver the BE WELL session we both run in the village of Wombwell. We both enjoy running these sessions as the people who attend gain a wide variety of knowledge on various topics such as portion control and the importance of physical activity.
16:00 I meet up with one of my clients in Goldthorpe. I am so proud of her as when we first met she told me she had tried loads of fad diets and as never lost any weight. Since we have worked together she has lost over 1 stone. It’s a good feeling to work in a job that improves people’s lives.
17:00 Time to work at our community gym. It’s busy today so I have plenty of gym inductions to do. I then work with a client who has very severe health issues and together we work out a programme that is safe and effective to improve her condition. Finish working at the gym and check emails again.
20:30 Arrive at home and sit down with my partner, we have tea together (Salmon and rice) and then we are off to Sheffield to watch Star Wars -I can’t wait!

Our New head of Quality and Compliance talks work, badminton…and beating ‘the beast’!
So tell us a bit about your background
Well I moved to England 10 years ago from Glasgow after university to join a graduate programme in local government. I’ve worked in social care and health
organisations ever since focusing on a wide range of areas including policy, performance, inspections, quality, complaints, equality and information management and governance – which are all very applicable to my new role here at PSS. My most recent job was working for a Sport England programme called “I Will If You Will” which aims to encourage behaviour change and get more women and girls into sport and physical activity. This is what started off the national ‘This Girl Can’ campaign.
What are you looking forward to most in your new role?
All of it! I’m particularly looking forward to going out to meet all the services, the people who work there, the service users and carers and having the conversations which help us to understand what quality means to them and how we can best demonstrate that we’re achieving it. I’m also looking forward to helping services produce their own impact reports, as well as the overall PSS impact report which will really demonstrate not only what we do, but the outcomes we help people to achieve and the wider social impact that PSS has. I will also enjoy working on the governance side of things, as I’m a bit of a data geek, and making it easier for the Board to understand the measures we have in place to demonstrate how well we are performing. Also I’m finishing an MSc at the moment and will be looking to do a work-based study on an area of PSS which will contribute to organisational learning which is quite exciting.
What have you enjoyed most about your role so far?
Well the people for a start – I’m lucky to be working with Mandy, Kate and Lena who are the best team I could have hoped for and have done such an amazing job in this last year. We have already planned an away day to help us with team planning and bonding. But, the wider workforce at PSS also – everyone has been really friendly and welcoming and actually seem pleased that I’ve come here. It’s really easy for performance or compliance leads to be treated with suspicion and caution – but luckily I think that everyone understands that our approach to quality is about having more of a conversation and being supportive rather than checking up on them.
Tell us a bit more about what you do out of work
Well I play for a badminton league in Manchester and compete in tournaments as well. In fact I played in November at a tournament in Ghent in Belgium and won gold with my partner. It was a shame though as we beat two members of our own club to silver. I also like cooking, entertaining, playing piano and I am a bit of a quiz buff too. I’ve won nearly £14,000 on several quiz shows including Weakest Link, Supermarket Sweep, Eggheads and The Chase where I beat the Beast!

Learning On The Job

Learning On The Job
Over the past few years students have become a regular and welcome sight around our services, providing invaluable assistance while developing their social work skills.
We have around 40-50 students per year, most of whom come from the social work BA or MA at Liverpool Hope University. There are two types of placement, the first lasts for 70 days and the second runs for 100 days and takes place before qualification – near the end of a BA or MA course. Each student has a Practice Educator – a
qualified social worker who helps to make sure the skills and theories they’ve studied in the classroom transfer into their practical work on placement. Pam Foy describes the role as “supporting, teaching and ensuring the students learn their craft. Having so many students come through PSS each year means we’re creating hundreds of ambassadors for our organisation.”
Pam and Rose: “We would like to say a huge thank you to all our 2015/2016 students for the hard work, enthusiasm and positive attitude shown whilst on placement with PSS, we wish you well for the future.”
What the students say…
“Lots of support, no pressure to take on high caseloads or lone working until I felt ready. At the same time, my supervisor and Practice Educator gave me the freedom to take on work if I expressed an interest. As a result I took on as much as possible and felt comfortable and supported to do so.
” “Having other students in the same place meant that you had people that understood your experience in terms of nerves etc. PSS houses various services and this was such an advantage because you had the opportunity to learn from other services as well as your own.”
 “Pam was a amazing Practice Educator, always encouraged and helped keep me calm when I was stressed with work. She went the extra mile to make sure I was getting the best out of my
 placement.” “I didn’t feel like I was a student, I felt like I was part of the team straight away.”

Remembering Eleanor Rathbone 1872-1946



 
March 11, 2016
Conor Anderson
Remembering Eleanor Rathbone 1872-1946
PSS, as we know it now, started life in Liverpool in late 1918, and owed much to Eleanor Rathbone’s activism. Eleanor was one of Liverpool’s most prominent women the daughter of the liberal MP, Philanthropist, and social reformer, William Rathbone VI.
 
A feminist and suffragist, she was a powerful and effective social and welfare reformer in her own right, and in 1909 had become the first woman to win a seat on Liverpool City Council as the Independent member for Granby ward.
Her background in building up the city’s social services, with Elizabeth Macadam (1871-1948), pre-dated the First World War. In the aftermath of the conflict the two women, aided by Frederick D’Aeth (1875-1940) and other allies, revitalised the Liverpool Council of Voluntary Aid (LCVA) to meet the desperate social needs of the city.
They appointed an experienced social worker, Dorothy Keeling (1881-1967) as the first secretary of the newly created personal services committee, and under her leadership, voluntary workers were enrolled and organised on a ward basis.
Each was then given responsibility for a small number of families. They gave advice but not money, which, early on, created much dissent amongst other
philanthropic institutions in the city.
The advantage of The Personal Services Society, as it was renamed in 1922, was its ability and willingness to respond quickly to the crises of the day: in times of extreme poverty caused by high unemployment they set up clothing and boot clubs as well as a loan fund. But they were also innovative, exemplified by the holiday service that Eleanor set up in 1927 to send both working women and housewives away for a break.
PSS inspired the establishment of numerous other voluntary organisations, locally and nationally, many of which became household names, including the Citizen’s Advice Bureau and Age Concern.
Eleanor’s influence and ethos is still present today as Person Shaped Support continues to innovate and to influence- as she did- health, social and community services, making a real difference to people’s lives. Significantly, the Rathbone family connection endures, supporting the organisation that their distant relative helped create, and reflecting their commitment to the family motto ‘what can be done ought to be done.’
During 2016, today’s PSS will be helping the Remembering Eleanor Rathbone group to commemorate and celebrate the 70th anniversary of Eleanor Rathbone’s death in 1946, and her commitment to the betterment of society.
As grand as it sounds, the group comprises just two of us, myself and Lesley Urbach. Lesley’s primary
interest is in Eleanor’s humanitarian work for refugees, especially Jews, in and from Nazi Europe before and during the Second World War. We are determined to raise Eleanor’s status, and for every aspect of her activism to be recognised and acknowledged. The year began with two exhibitions about Eleanor, one at the Central Library, the other at the University of Liverpool Library as well as a Roscoe lecture on 14 January 2016 at the Adelphi Hotel.

Midlands Celebrates In Style!
PSS teams across the country celebrated Christmas in style. Jan Hooper tells us a
little about the Midlands party…
The Christmas party for Midlands Shared Lives took place on 16th December at The White Eagle Club. Those who access our service and their carers came along to enjoy a disco, buffet and raffle prizes. A lot of them said that this particular party was one of the best that they had attended. We had a really good turn-out, everyone was dancing and socialising with one another and had a really good time! As you can see from the Photos, Christmas jumpers were a popular choice!

Making Days At Dutch Farm

Making Days At Dutch Farm

When PSS took over the running of Bridge Chapel day centre we also took over a whole other facility at ‘Dutch Farm’- a plot of land that’s been used by Bridge Chapel attendees to gain skills in gardening and crafts.
Long ago the area used to be a landfill site, but it’s since been repurposed to become the lovely green area it is today. The YMCA run a large part of the site, but PSS are now beginning to think about the potential their patch has for both day centre users and the community in Garston. Day centre worker Will told The Loop about the site’s potential ‘There’s a piece of work to do around risk and health and safety but once we’ve sorted all that we really want to get the community and schools involved in Dutch Farm.’

Mark, who’s attended Bridge Chapel and Dutch Farm for years told us how much he got out of the courses he’s attended there in the past ‘We did hanging baskets. I didn’t know how to do it at first but I learned and then I made three on my own. I got really into it. I’d love to do more courses and learn more’.

At the moment the team are looking into ways to fund the project going forward, and Will has been busy sending out supporter packs to local businesses who might want to give back to the community by donating goods. ‘We’ve got big plans, we want to build some garden furniture and get a sensory garden in at Dutch Farm for those who need it. We’re taking some of the people who attend making days over to see one in Croxteth soon and we hope it will get us thinking creative about the work we can do with Dutch farm!’

If you have any ideas on ways we could use Dutch Farm facilities or you want to donate materials then contact Bridge Chapel on: 0151 494 0747

A Spinning World Phd



 
March 8, 2016
Conor Anderson
A Spinning World Phd
On 17th December Lynn Learman, Service Manager of Spinning World and Palliative Care, was awarded her Doctorate in Counselling from Manchester University.
PSS Spinning World is a specialist psychological therapy service working with migrant communities who have experienced trauma. The title of Lynn’s research was ‘A DIALOGUE WITH THREE VOICES’ and looked at how working through an interpreter affects psychological therapy. Lynn interviewed 12 people involved in Spinning World who were all ‘experts by experience’, four counsellors, four interpreters and four ex-clients who could not speak English when they accessed the service through a focus group and semi-structured interviews. She says that there is very little research in this field internationally because of the problems of accessing hard to reach groups.
That’s why this kind of research can be done by PSS where our core values mean that trust and respect have been established with service users who have very little voice anywhere else. They were happy to talk about their experiences and felt free to give some constructive criticism without worrying if this would impact on their relationship with the service.
The participants talked about the specific role of the interpreter, the practitioners talked about the management of emotion, and everyone talked about differing cultures of mental health and verbal and non-verbal communication. Everyone interviewed had been changed by the experience of working in a triad:
One interpreter (Majid) said that working at Spinning World was ‘another world of interpreting’ from any other kind of interpreting job they had to do’.
“It’s not easy when the client tells you that they are going to end up killing themselves. The client takes long ‘cos they express their feelings and how they feel inside and what makes them happy and unhappy… When you come here its silent and emotional and the person can go from one mood to another.” Fatima (Interpreter)
“I feel maybe if it wasn’t coming to Spinning World maybe on that day I will kill myself, because I tried to kill myself a lot of time… it was very, very amazing for me…I never see people like that… that was very, very, special. I could say that they big supported me.” Mariam (Client)
The research concludes that above all, successfully working in a therapeutic triad requires two differently skilled practitioners who both need excellent communication skills. However there are multiple layers of communication based on much more than the words we use to express ourselves. When good practice guidelines are adhered to the presence of a skilled interpreter can enhance the work and support both the therapist and the client.
“In your mind you have to accept there is a third party can help you achieve what you want to achieve… she was very kind by listening to each word I was saying and translate it to the counsellor… One day by day, session by session, the counsellor and the interpreter were close to me, they felt like my sisters… they are part of my life… I was low, very low but thank God and thanks to my therapist I am much better, I can’t forget what happened to me no. It’s there, it’s there but… I am getting a little bit emotional when I remember… I am so grateful what these woman done for me.”
Nadia (Client)

Men’s Sheds:  Sarah from Team Wales shares how the scheme has helped Sean
Sean Murray has made great progress at Men’s Sheds in Rhyl. He recently made a beautiful bird table for his carers Wendy and Llion.
Not long after bringing it home Sean received recognition from the project coordinator for his efforts and his willingness to learn. Not only this but Sean recently achieved his orange belt in Karate! I am so proud of him and can’t wait to see what he is going to achieve next! Men’s Sheds is a community project promoting men’s health and well-being through social interaction and practical activity. It is a social group made up of men from all walks of life, who wish to learn and share skills and trades from and with each other. It is a place where men can come together and share life experiences in a friendly, fun, welcoming environment. Where men can have a chat and a cuppa and put the world to rights.

A Year At PSS: Our Annual Report



 
February 9, 2016
Eleanor Riley
A Year At PSS: Our Annual Report
It is no secret that the 2014/15 financial year has been a challenge for many organisations across the UK and we, like many others, have witnessed ever increasing need, fuelled by significant reductions in health and social care funding. With this in mind we started the year in April 2014 with continued focus on our 5 year strategic plan, placing particular emphasis on those elements that will secure our future through the anticipated challenges ahead.
Our attention has been centred on three core principles; evolution, efficiency and excellence.
Evolution
Like any other year, staying true to our vision was always going to be key in 2014/15. It’s at times like these that making a ‘real difference to people’s lives’ requires creativity that is rooted in experience and knowledge. This year we’ve seen this approach give birth to our newest service, Ruby. Ruby takes the classic principles of working with women who are experiencing domestic violence but does this within a hospital emergency environment allowing need to be addressed as early as  possible. This new service allows intervention to take place earlier, reducing both harm to the woman and her family, while simultaneously increasing potential savings for the state by reducing hospital re-attendance and the need for more critical services later on.
Efficiency
Alongside innovation and evolution, we have spent a lot of time this year looking at how we can work in better ways and achieve efficiencies internally to ensure that we are able to maintain our service delivery. A key element of this during 14/15 involved a significant restructure giving us a strong footing as we anticipate further financial pressures over the coming years.
Excellence
Last, but by no means least, we have had a real emphasis on ensuring our services are excellent; we believe the people we support deserve nothing less. This year we’ve enhanced our internal auditing processes, progressed and strengthened service-user inclusion projects, focussed on strengthening our safeguarding systems and procedures and refreshed our feedback processes. We are incredibly proud of the quality of our delivery and I and the rest of the Board know we can only do this because of the dedication, skills and value-base of everybody involved in PSS. We have continued to receive the wonderful support of all of our stakeholders, from our friends and members to our commissioners and service users. We value this hugely and have made every effort to return that support through the manner in which we conduct our business, the services we provide and by constantly seeking means to add value, all of which is in complete alignment with our core principles.
I feel assured that I can speak for the whole PSS team in saying that there is, justifiably, a large amount of pride in our achievements over the last 12 months. My thanks, and those of the rest of the Board, go to each and every member of our team and to all those that continue to support us. We look forward to taking this hard-work forward and building on this solid platform in 2015-16.

Ready for take off! Lee takes to the skies at Duxford Imperial War Museum
Lee Dowling’s recent holiday to Norfolk took an unexpected turn when he got the opportunity to take part in a flight experience. Lee, who was away with carer’s Pauline and Keith Appleton and fellow shared lives user Ken took a trip to the Duxford Imperial War Museum which is jam packed with World War memorabilia as well as different types of aircraft.
When Lee’s carer Pauline saw that you could book onto a flight experience she immediately thought of Lee. “I saw it and I knew that he’d love it. He loves a challenge!!” When Pauline first told Lee about the flight experience Lee didn’t think she was being serious, but once he realised she was he jumped at the chance. 
Lee donned his leather jacket and flying goggles to fly a Tiger Moth Bi Plane, and even gad a go at controlling the plane for a while whilst in the sky. “When I got out the pilot said I’d done really well.’ Says Lee “It was great, next time I’m going to do a helicopter.”

Anastasia’s Art: A Wellbeing Centre Story



 
November 27, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Anastasia’s Art: A Wellbeing Centre Story
October 10th was World Mental Health Day 2015, and PSS Head Office at Seel Street hosted an art exhibition “Art-tastic” where one of the pictures, named “Ladies’ Day”, was submitted by Anastasia Roberts, who uses services at our Leeson Centre.
Anastasia was referred to the centre in March this year suffering from depression and after having experienced her first psychotic episode. She first completed “Lifting moods and raising self-esteem” and “Anxiety Management” courses before starting a course of art therapy run by a Trainee Art Therapist Kate Prudom (University of Chester).
According to The British Association of Art Therapists, “art therapy is a form of psychotherapy that uses art as a medium to address emotional issues which may be confusing and distressing”. Kate created a safe, non-judgemental and confidential space for all art therapy service users in the centre she worked with. Anastasia describes art therapy as a process of detangling your thoughts, as if they were a ball of wool, followed by producing art images and then by finding words to describe your feelings, as an art therapist talks a client through their work. Having attended both group and individual art therapy sessions in the centre, she is now more in touch with her emotions, makes more sense of her health conditions and is able to better identify experiences which help her gain control over situations and nurture her.
Anastasia also joined a peer-led arts and crafts group in Leeson Centre and immediately felt that the people coming to this group are welcomed, accepted with warmth and encouraged to have a say over how the group is run and how sessions are planned. She was very excited and happy about her experience of leading the group over the course of one three-week project where seven group members each sewed a toy monkey by recycling a pair of stripy socks and filling them with toy filling. Sue White, the peer leader of the group, welcomed Anastasia to run another crafts project after Christmas.

A day in the life- Support Worker Len Edmondson and Andrew
Len Edmonson has worked for PSS for over 10 years, starting off in St Helens Community support before taking some hours here with Liverpool Community Support.
Every Thursday he supports Andrew, and The Loop joined them to see how a typical Thursday goes for the pair…. Little did we know we’d have a tasty homemade treat to take away.
Every Tuesday and Thursday Liverpool City Centre Methodist Church opens its doors to the community for a bread making workshop. They describe the workshops as ‘gathering the community round the making and sharing of bread’, and over the past 6 years pastor Ian has been doing just that. At 10.30 am a small queue was forming outside their building on Bold Street (they’re based above the news from nowhere bookshop) with everyone keen to get in and start baking.
Once inside we were greeted by Ian and Sue who work for the church and talked us newbies through the bread making process. Len and Andrew are regularly and so went straight to the sink to wash their hands and get first pick of the aprons while Ian explained the different types of flour to me
‘You can pick between white, granary or wholemeal flour, we normally recommend a blend with some white just to help it rise. We also suggest that people bake 2 loaves and give one away to a stranger, we’re encouraging random acts of kindness in the community. It’s quite quiet today, which is a nice change from having 29 people here on Tuesday!’
Once we had our flour it was time to start mixing. ‘Andrew doesn’t always join in with this part of the process, but I always talk him through what we’re adding to the mix and why. Once it’s time to knead the dough that’s when Andrew enjoys getting involved’ during the mixing Andrew relaxed with a cup of tea and some lovely homemade shortbread made to celebrate group leader Sue’s birthday.
‘This is a great activity for Andrew as it means he’s around lots of different people and is trying out different things. In the summer he gets outside and do activities like bike riding in Wavetree and on Wednesdays he sometimes goes horse riding with his mum. But when the weather gets colder these activities become less enjoyable for Andrew. We’re always on the lookout for alternatives that he’ll still enjoy and get something out of.’
Once the dough is kneaded it goes in a proving cupboard (bake off fans will be familiar with these) and is only removed once it’s doubled in size. To make sure everyone knows what loaf is theirs we use a small amount of dough to put our initials on the top.
After another round of kneading and proving the loaves go in to bake and it’s lunch time.
For just £1 anyone can help themselves to homemade bread rolls and a vegetarian soup. Andrew always bring his own sandwiches from home but stays for lunch with the group.
‘Andrew always enjoys coming here, he’s always laughing and smiling and getting stuck in with kneading the dough’ says Len ‘I always enjoy coming to work to support Andrew, he’s great company’
NOTES: 
Somewhere Else community bread making runs Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10.30-2 (last flour weigh at 11am)

What a difference a day makes



 
November 25, 2015
Eleanor Riley
What a difference a day makes
This was certainly the case when I had the pleasure to support the first round of support worker recruitment recently…and what a fantastic experience this was.
As many of you will have heard, we were awarded a contract for Liverpool North and South day support services which sits under our Home and Community directorate and has been aptly named our Making Days Service. As a result, we are recruiting a brand new team consisting of 2 managers, 5 team leaders and over 60 Support Workers. With the help of local newspaper features and social media, we have had a great response.
Head of Service Pam Booth tells me how this wouldn’t have been the case without the much appreciated help and support from fellow colleagues: Emma McGregor, Tessa Dunbavin, Jordan Smith, Karol Zwolinski, Bob Bell, Rita Lalley, Chris Barker and the newly appointed Julie Humphreys.
As we all know, we continuously try to embed the message of how “it’s not just about what we do, it’s how we do it”. Our vision and values are an important element of this, they help make up our culture as does our individual personalities, experiences and the way we all work together.
At present, we are working hard to adapt and improve our recruitment processes to ensure that there is equal focus on a person’s attitude as well as the key competencies we are looking for.
These interviews incorporated this approach and we attracted some great candidates who were bursting with passion to be part of our new service. After an introduction to PSS and our new service, they took part in group exercises / discussions (around quality, values and activities provided to meet needs of the people we support) and concluded with a 1:1 panel interview.
Joining Pam on the recruitment panel was our two new Making Days managers who experienced the interview process for themselves not long before. Our new south services manager Julie Humphreys, who is joining us with extensive work experience and a commitment to our values and person centred practices. Working alongside Julie will be our very own Tessa Dunbavin managing our North services. Tessa currently works within our Shared Lives Service but is excited to be part of something new and to help create innovative and positive experiences for people we will support.
We also had some great support and feedback from David Pealing who uses the Alderwood day centre along with David’s Dad Ray and fellow parents Eddie Crowe and Sandra Steen.
Pam explained how the project is extremely committed to involving families and individuals who use the services in everything they do to be able to help us shape the service moving forward.
David spoke enthusiastically about why the centre was important to him and how he enjoyed the many activities such as drama groups (delivered by professional actress Lindsey), swimming, gardening, bowling, cooking and of course football. Being an avid Liverpool Football Club Fan (I reluctantly promised to mention this being the Evertonian that I am), David explained how he would love to meet their new manager Jurgen Klopp. However, what David enjoyed most was being able to spend time with his many friends at the service including Nicki, Keith, Marlene, George and many more.
Ray and Eddie mentioned how many of the individuals attending the service had been doing so since they were young so they had grown up together in a very supportive community environment. This was evident when hearing about the level of active interest and involvement they all have. It was personally a pleasure to spend time with the people at the heart of our services.
The families noted the skills and experience they could see coming through as part of the discussions but more importantly the attitudes. Ray was particularly impressed with how people spoke about working with people with disabilities. One candidate in particular expressed her joy about having the opportunity to occasionally support two vulnerable adults as part of her customer service role and why she was pursuing a different career direction in care. This lady had no formal care experience or qualifications yet displayed all of the valuable attributes we would look for in a PSS support worker.
David told me how he had really enjoyed being part of the recruitment day. When I asked what he enjoyed most, he replied meeting the new people, how friendly and caring they were and that he liked how well everyone got on together. David also gave us great feedback about the communication skills he had observed – how well people spoke, wrote and made eye contact with him. He was already spotting some great potential in terms of future value awards winners.
It’s not just about the effort that our panel and staff put into the day, we also appreciate the time and effort all of our applicants take in applying for our vacancies so it is essential that they have a good recruitment experience (whether the role is for them or not).
We stressed the importance of people trying to relax and be themselves to allow everyone to get the most from the experience. Being able to facilitate and observe a lot of the day, it was great to see how supportive the candidates were of each other. I heard echoing comments of how people really got the impression of PSS being one big family and how for some, this had been the best interview experience that they had been part of.
Pam explained the aim was to continue to successfully recruit and train their new team to be able to start delivering the service from December this year. Together, they will be focusing on getting to know everyone individually, understand what already works well and what we can we do to make the experiences the best they can be for the people we support.
When I asked David what he wanted from his support worker, I think he summed it perfectly “someone who will learn about me”. I don’t think I could have said it any better.
By investing our time and effort into these processes, we ultimately hope to find the right PSS People with person centred approaches to help us build upon what are already fantastic services.

Introducing: Liverpool Community Development Services



 
November 24, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Introducing: Liverpool Community Development Services
Team Leader Karl Smith tells us a little bit about the service and some of our newest PSS people…
Liverpool Community Development Service (LCDS) is a new service designed to support Liverpool’s BME communities improve and understand mental health issues affecting them. In doing this, we engage with communities using a range of community development approaches to get to the heart of mental health and how best their issues can be reflected in services provided and the commissioning process.
Running alongside community engagement, LCDS also work and support Mental Health service providers to better understand how their services impact on BME communities. Advising them on any modifications they need to consider, making their services more appropriate to meet the needs of BME service users.  Other support we give to service providers relates to what is known as Cultural Competency support and training. Cultural Competency is a process where support is given to mental health provider staff, increasing their awareness of: attitudes, knowledge, and skills that both the provider and the service user may, or may not have, when dealing with concepts linked to mental health. Mental health may have an established understanding within a Westernised culture but could mean something completely different in non- Western cultures. Another aspect of cultural competency is, to challenge systemic practices that may favour a “one size fits all” ethos, where all service users are treated as having the same/similar mental health needs and/or the same levels of understanding.
In addition to broad community development, LCDS also has a person-centred advocacy focus, with an advocacy specialist employed on a full time basis providing this support. The key component of LCDS’s Advocacy Worker is to support BME individuals’ access into appropriate services and support them in dealing with any external issues that may be impacting on their mental health. Another aspect of the Advocacy Worker’s role is to support individuals identify and challenge inappropriate practices and treatment which may prevent them from getting the appropriate support they need.
As the manager of Liverpool Community Development Services, I’m really excited to be working with PSS. To me PSS is an organisation that has a long history of understanding and delivering grass roots services, one that can only enhance the work that we are doing here at LCDS.
Notes:
LCDS has been in existence since August 2015 and operates from the heart of the BME community in Liverpool 8. But in a sense the service is a continuation of a project that was run by Liverpool PCT called “The Community Development Team’ which operated for about 10 years as part of the NHS /Government’s Delivering Race Equality programme. The new service, commissioned by Liverpool CCG, is delivered by PSS, Mary Seacole House and Mersey Care in partnership.
Mohammed, Afrah and Dee all previously worked as Community Development Workers (CDW’s). They all bring experience, networks, good practice and memory that will ensure the transition from the CDW Project to LCDS will be seamless for both our partners and the communities we work with.

The people who use our services drive what we do: The Wellbeing Centres



 
November 23, 2015
Eleanor Riley
The people who use our services drive what we do: The Wellbeing Centres
‘The knowledge and experiences of people who use our services should be recognised as an asset’- Nicky McGovern, Wellbeing Centres Service Manager tells us more about how her team (pictured) have engaged the people who use their services in a new and exciting way.
‘Service user involvement is full of so many thorny issues, it always seems to be a work in progress. Writing this has allowed me as a service manager to reflect on my own changing relationship with service users.
I believe that changing our relationships and attitudes towards service users is just as important for service user involvement as developing policies and procedures.
Over the last 7 or so years there has been a major culture shift at our Wellbeing Centres. The relationship between staff and service users used to be very much ‘them and us’ Staff as experts and service users with needs. Staff teaching service users how the way they were thinking was wrong and ways to feel better. Though teaching people ways to feel better is not such a bad thing, it all looked and felt very ‘text book’.
Contrast this with my own experience. My first day as a project worker at the Umbrella Centre, I had no specialist mental health knowledge and only a social work qualification to my name. 13 years later I am proud to say that all I know about mental health, I have learned from service users who have shared their experience with me. From each of their personal recovery stories.
So my own professional journey within mental health has convinced me that the knowledge and experiences of people who use our services should be recognised as an asset. It is a real wealth within all our services and too often it goes untapped.
Our service has gradually moved away from ‘them and us’ Our fantastic team of staff and service users share responsibility for course delivery and deciding what should be provided.
This hasn’t been an easy journey, we as staff needed to accept that they don’t always know best and service users no longer could get away with just telling us where we are going wrong. A joint approach is now expected.
So what do we do differently now?
We have developed a peer support pathway as a vehicle for promoting involvement and co-production.
In order for service users to have the skills and confidence to contribute at meetings and deliver courses, we worked in partnership with The Basement, a local organisation that offered free peer mentoring courses.
Over the last 5 years 42 service users have gained an accredited qualification, some moving on to paid employment outside of PSS.
As a progression we developed the role of volunteer peer support worker within the service. Peer support workers oversee a variety of groups at the centres some are conversational groups others are activity based
Here’s what they currently deliver:
Tom* leads Yoga sessions
Janet co-facilitates a reading group
Jenna leads the womens group
Darren leads the mens group
Phil leads on digital involvement.
Karen leads a singing group
Phillip leads PSS Creatives
Sandra leads art journaling sessions
Mike, Emily and Dean lead Culture Vultures
 
If we go back to service users as assets not just of needs I would like to concentrate on Phil for a minute.
The 1st line of Phil’s referral to the service said: Client is struggling with low mood, is isolating himself and finding it difficult to motivate himself .
 
18 months later and Phil is a much valued volunteer and colleague not only of our service he also volunteers for the CAB, Sahir House and is a trustee of Liverpool Mental Health Consortium
Our new approach has achieved positive outcomes not just for Phil but for all the services he now volunteers for. Within these services he is most certainly valued as an asset.
 
This year we have stepped up a gear regarding involving service users. We have employed a Service User Representative who works 2hrs per week on a sessional basis.
We have always held service user forums at the centres, but that is where involvement in decision making stopped. This year we made the leap and recruited a service user representative to represent the service user voice in team meetings.
Having a service user at team meetings has been a massive culture change for the team. It is something we always knew was the right thing to do but concerns regarding confidentiality issues always acted as a barrier. This year we were brave and took the leap and confidentiality has not been such an issue.
To minimise risk we recruited someone who had used the service within the last 6 months and had moved on. We employed Emily, who has spent the last year meeting with all the groups completing a survey and writing a report on Peer Support.
Again this has positive outcomes for all involved not just Emily as it not only helps us improve the quality of Peer Support but also will be valuable evidence for future funding bids.
Lastly I want to tell you about Kindred Minds.
We have supported the development of Kindred Minds a user-led organisation. This year it was awarded £10,000 grant from Liverpool CCG to develop WellPool an online blog where people share what keeps them well. This is a massive achievement for Kindred Minds with those service users involved passionate about keeping it all going.
It’s not all about PSS supporting Kindred Minds either. Recently, Kindred Minds kindly agreed to fund a service user summer day out. I have also just written a proposal that they sponser the next PSS Creatives drama production. I am awaiting their decision with a wry smile on my face, what a role reversal! Who has the power now?’

Ruby goes from strength to strength



 
November 17, 2015

Ruby goes from strength to strength
It’s been just over a year since our Comic Relief funded domestic abuse service launched at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. Since its launch the service has had some fantastic outcomes and has helped over 70 women through A&E and routine admissions where either the women disclose to the staff or the team suspect there is domestic abuse.
Due to the success of the project, the Women’s Turnaround and Business Development teams have been keen to expand in order to help more women across Liverpool and beyond through domestic abuse.
‘We’ve applied for a few different pots of money over the past 12 months’ says Business Development Manager Michelle Corrigan ‘We’ve always had confidence that the Ruby model had huge potential to change lives and we’re delighted Big Lottery see that too and have agreed to fund our work at Aintree Hospital. The service is secure for 3 years now and it means we can grow the team. Because of the location the service will be able to help more women from Liverpool and also from the surrounding boroughs of Sefton and Knowsley’
Specialist practitioner Heather Bromilow shares her thoughts:
“Kimberley Worthington and I are incredibly proud of this service and it’s something we have grown and nurtured to make it what it is today. This extension into Aintree has been something we have driven towards since the service begun and it will complement our current work for our women. We are passionate about bringing our service to women at the earliest opportunity to go some way in reducing risk and repeat victims. The women we have worked with have been eternally grateful for the outreach that we provide and reaching them to help break them free of abuse. The service that we have developed in The Royal has been a steep learning curve but it has provided a strong foundation for us to build upon as we grow. We’re particularly proud that this is the first service of its kind in Liverpool and we’re also thrilled to bring PSS their first domestic abuse service in a city where more and more victims are coming forward to find help.”

PSS Team Wales Skate-athon

PSS Team Wales Skate-athon
What started as a team building activity for our Wales team has now become a fundraising challenge that will go towards christmas celebrations for the people who use our services across North Wales which include Shared Lives and Trio.
‘I do roller derby and heard about the marathon and thought it would be a good challenge for everyone.’ explained Shared Lives Development Worker Sarah Zielonka. ‘I’ve managed to rope three of my team into joining up and they’ll be doing the 26 miles between them. They’ve not skated since they were kids so the whole thing would be too much at this stage, and at just under 9 miles each, it’s still a massive challenge. As I’m bit more experienced I’m going to attempt the whole thing.’
The team will be skating on 11th October at the Marsh Tracks in Rhyl. You can find out more about the event on their website. ‘We want to raise £500 but the more the better!’ says Team Wales Apprentice Ross ‘That amount would mean a present for each person and a small party too’

Values Awards: Team Of The Year





September 14, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Values Awards: Team Of The Year
Winners: Barnsley Health Trainers
The 2015 team of the year award goes to a service that embodies all of our values. As the person who nominated put it: ‘we support, motivate and encourage individuals and groups to make healthy lifestyle changes, helping to create a healthy and happy Barnsley.’
Improving group work
The team this year has really strived to make improvements to our healthy lifestyle interventions which include: fit mums, cook well be well, fit reds, activity 4 health and fit families.
The team have done a full review and focused on ensuring that goals are meaningful and personal to the individual even though they are in a group setting. Staff have been part of this process; creating new lesson plans, implementing the use of technology e.g apps in sessions and using the new ‘my journey card’.
The team put behaviour change at the heart of their work, and this year the percentage of service users from the most deprived areas of Barnsley has risen by 7%.
The improvements made to their group work is also paying off: with 65% of attendees now achieving their goal, compared to 47% of 1:1 interventions.
Barnsley were one of the first services to receive an Emerald rating from Jane Evans and the quality team- proof of their achievements and improvements over the past year.
Earning the trust of health professionals 
Over the past 4 years the Barnsley Health Trainers have increased GP referrals by 49%, and are now present in 26 surgeries across the region. From one initial surgery, this is quite a turnaround and the GP’s now see the team as invaluable and give brilliant feedback to the team.
Understanding
As the nominator put it ‘Innovation is key to what we do, especially creating new ways to engage with groups of people who have the poorest health.’ And the team evidence it in their unique ideas that they confidently carry through to completion.
New projects such as; People and Paws engage those at risk of isolation using pet therapy and offer a holistic approach to both mental and physical health. One attendee commented: “I love it, just takes all my worries away”
Another innovation ‘FIT HOME DVD’ was created in response to requests from clients for exercises they could do at home. It supports clients alongside their personal health plan. It also reaches those who don’t want to engage in group sessions. Health Trainers lead each video session, clients receive a telephone consultation to start with and then weekly face to face or phone reviews in the weeks following.
Since it’s March 2015 launch the team have sent out 86 DVDs and have gained 64 new clients this way. They’re now supporting the Liverpool Health Trainers to develop their own version.
 
Bravery
After careful consideration and strategy meetings the team have branched out into social media and have achieved great success.118 people have self-referred through social media compared to just 60 through leaflets.
After a big push to raise the profile of the service through twitter, they gained over 500 additional followers over a 6 month period. They now have strong links with local councillors on social media and have gained freebies for People and Paws from local businesses. The services social media presence has also led to participation I academic interviews and in press attention from the Barnsley Chronicle. We have started new this year an Instagram and Pinterest page that operate alongside the well-used ‘fit mums’ facebook page that currently has 1,262 likes.
Choice
If the massive variety of groups and resources the team provides wasn’t enough choice, the also made 492 referrals to other services in the past year, 351 of which were to foodbanks.
As the nomination states ‘We provide people with choices and options for ways they can help themselves get back on track. This helping hand and point in the right direction can be at time of crisis for example this year our work with the Food Bank specifically in the Dearne has been a vital resource to local people’
Potential
Barnsley use the champion model, which really empowers people to take on challenges and learn new skills. Here’s some of the ways the team have used to this to help people reach their potential;
55 champion recruited this year 19 of whom were clients of the Health Trainer Service.
Champion led groups:

Men’s Health – 8 champions delivering football sessions, disability football and cycling sessions.
Community growing and planting- 6 champions support the running, delivery of groups and development of the Shaw Lane Community Garden.
People and Paws- is a new area of work supported by a health champion who provides transport for the group every week.

Values Awards: We’re brave enough to take risks





September 14, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Values Awards: We’re brave enough to take risks
 We received more than one nomination for this employee this year regarding the support they provided to one of our Supported Living service users.
Winner: Natalie Desilva
Natalie Desilva has worked for PSS for 9 ½ years. Natalie initially worked for our Newby House service as a Resource Worker and then went on to become a Support Worker with our Supported Living service. 
B is supported within their own home where they live with their parents. B has an acquired brain injury as a result of an accident and currently requires two to one support 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. As an individual with complex needs, this means B has limited capacity and is unable to communicate their wishes or when they are in pain or discomfort. Natalie has worked with B for several years and has built up an understanding of their needs and how they express themselves.
By the very nature of the service the family takes a keen and close interest in B’s care. When the parents are away, the team continues to care for B within the home and are accountable to B’s sister. 
In December last year, B became very unwell. On this particular occasion, it was Natalie who was supporting B and she was concerned about their health as they were having difficulty breathing. She called the sister who asked Natalie to keep an eye on how B was presenting and suggested taking B to the doctor’s the following day.
Natalie intended to do just that but as time went on she became increasingly concerned. However, going to the Doctors immediately would have meant going beyond what she had agreed with B’s sister. 
Natalie noticed that their breathing was not getting any better. In the end she decided to go with her gut feeling, take the brave option and called an ambulance for B and informed their family afterwards. When B was in hospital, it transpired that they had a serious infection. The staff at the hospital said that if Natalie had not acted quickly like she had and alerted for an ambulance then B may have died. 
 
Whilst in hospital the doctors thought the worst for B and did not expect them to pull through. Thankfully after a long stay in hospital, B was discharged and has been much better since. Natalie’s quick actions from her understanding of B’s needs and what is normal for them meant that they got the medical attention they needed and quickly – something the family are extremely grateful for. If it had been someone else on shift who was not as experienced, things may have been very different for this individual. 
Natalie shows excellent values all year round being very person centred, thinking about the needs, wants and aspirations of the people she supports. 
As a panel, all were in agreement that this was a clear winning example of an individual who has demonstrated bravery within her role. Knowing one person’s actions could have literally saved another person’s life is truly amazing.

Values Awards: We recognise potential





September 11, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Values Awards: We recognise potential
The person who submitted this winning nomination explains how the employee’s attitude and commitment to their role and PSS demonstrates potential in a variety of ways.
Winner: Andy Crawford
Andy Crawford is our Financial Account Assistant working within our Central Services. Andy started with PSS in February 2014 as a Trainee Finance Assistant as part of the Apprentice programme and I was delighted when he gained full time employment with us in October 2014 as a member of the Finance team.
Andy is a person who I could nominate for a number of our values as I believe he demonstrates all of them in some way through his everyday work. However, potential is the award that I am nominating him for.
Andy has such a positive attitude to work and everyday life that he has a huge positive influence on the Finance team as a whole. Nothing is ever too much trouble for him and anything you ask him to do is always done with a smile. 
Andy has learnt so much in the short time he has been here given this was his first role within a Finance department. Andy learns new tasks very quickly and once he fully understands, he then looks for ways to improve our processes. He is someone who enjoys improving his knowledge and also sharing that knowledge with his team. Andy is a team member whom you can completely rely on to complete any task he is set and does so with a ‘can do’ attitude.
 
Andy has also spent some time training new members of the Financial Accounts team and they have commented on how his approach has been very helpful. Members of the Commercial Accounts team have also praised Andy. He also makes contributions to PSS as a whole by becoming a fire marshall, being the Finance rep as part of induction and by being involved in reviewing the induction process itself.
Alongside his commitment to his role, Andy has also being studying towards his AAT Finance qualification and recently completed the first year foundation level and is continuing the intermediate level this year.
At Andy’s first year review, he was rated above target as he achieved above and beyond his objectives despite this being his first year working in a Finance environment. I feel Andy will have a very successful career ahead of him, he is an asset to PSS and deserving of this award.
Many of our panel members have had the opportunity to work with Andy directly. Just as Andy recognises potential to improve our services, we too see the huge potential Andy has to really go far with PSS. As one panel member put it ‘we haven’t seen the best of him yet!’

Values Awards: We encourage independence and choice





September 10, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Values Awards: We encourage independence and choice
The following nomination was submitted based on the support provided by this employee to our Supported Living service users, specifically one of our gentleman tenants, James, who sadly passed away this year.
Winner: Kirsty McCartney
Kirsty McCartney has been a Support Worker with PSS for almost six years with our Supported Living service. Kirsty works at Mill Lane which is a Supported Living home for adults with mental health needs.
James was a service user in his eighties and had a learning disability as well as a mental health problem. He lived with PSS for over 20 years and had no family. He enjoyed football and going to the pub for a pint. James was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2013. To the amazement of his doctors, he managed to live with a relatively good quality of life until January this year when he passed away at home.
Kirsty’s values shone through during this period as she worked really hard to ensure that James’ choice to die at home was respected. James had become unable to use the stairs in the house and needed to stay downstairs. When it was discussed that he might have to go to a hospice or move to another of our locations, Kirsty fought for him to be able to stay in the home he had known for many years. As a result, this was able to happen and James passed away at home supported by Kirsty and team members John Kayll and Joanne Stephens. 
Whilst James neared the end of life, Kirsty also continued to support our other service users to express their feelings and deal with their loss of a friend, whilst coming to terms with the loss herself.
Kirsty is always supporting people to express their choices. Recently she has been motivating other service users to go out in the community more and has arranged for one gentleman, Gary, to go to Madrid on holiday, which is one of his dreams. She has also worked hard with Adam, encouraging him to leave the house for walks and for lunch, despite the difficulties he can experience with his mental health needs.
Panel members were really touched by this nomination and felt that Kirsty’s efforts in this situation were second to none and enabled James to pass away at home as he wanted with the people he cared about around him. They also acknowledged the support provided to our others tenants in a very challenging situation, when others may have shied away from this and dissuaded them from exercising their choice.

Values Awards: We try to get even better at what we do





September 9, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Values Awards: We try to get even better at what we do
The person who submitted this nomination describes how this employee’s approach shows tremendous commitment and flexibility. He often works till late in the evening and sometimes through the night, and all with a positive approachable manner.
Winner: Ian Travis
Ian Travis has become a well-known face (and voice) to many of us over the years. Ian’s role of IT Business Partner has involved taking on sole responsibility for PSS’ ICT service over the past 12 months, during a period of great technological change at PSS. It is fair to say that if the old saying ‘a workman is as good as his tools’ were to be true, Ian would not have had a good chance of success.
Given PSS‘ charity status technology has not been an area we have chosen to invest in, given our core priority is to provide a quality service to service users. Working on maintaining the dated servers had become part of the role and often Ian had to work unsociable hours to keep the servers up and running. 
With the sudden departure of the ICT manager, Ian immediately stepped up taking on greater responsibility that required advanced technical knowledge and a thorough insight in our infrastructure/network requirements. Ian is extremely positive at all times and when faced with this challenge said he ‘just wants to get things working better and see IT providing a quality service to the business’
ICT has been outlined for many years at roadshows and surveys, as an area that causes much frustration amongst staff, often getting in the way of providing an excellent service to service users. Ian’s approach over the last 12 months has gone a long way towards improving this position.
The reduction in the team before the outsourcing of the support element, led to an increased reliance on Ian over the year. Servicing all of PSS sites is a big enough task however add an ICT outsourcing and procurement project into the mix, and the task becomes extremely challenging some may say impossible.
Ian has been heavily involved in specification of PSS requirements and contract negotiations to ensure at the end of the project we were left with a fit for purpose ICT solution. He has also managed to work with Lloyds in helping to define Support Service requirements, work with GCI to ensure PSS technical needs are met, in addition to rolling out approx 100 thin client/laptop devices and provided training at multiple sites
Following this year’s switch over, we now have a faster more efficient service. Ian’s response time to issues arising and positive attitude again made the switch relatively painless – a great step forward for PSS. 
Staff at a recent road show mentioned Ian specifically saying ‘someone should recommend Ian for an award’. Our panel agreed that Ian’s effort and attitude to improvement should be commended.

Values Awards: We will earn people’s trust





September 8, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Values Awards: We will earn people’s trust
This winning nomination was submitted by someone who came across this story at one of our recent roadshows storytelling sessions.
Winner: Katie Owens
This winning nomination was submitted by someone who came across this story at one of our recent roadshows storytelling sessions.
Katie Owens is a Specialist Practitioner with our Family Impact service. Katie has worked for PSS for nearly five years. A few years ago two children were referred to our Family Impact service. Their mother was a drug and alcohol user and there was concern for their well-being. When first referred the family gave the impression of coping well. It was only when the team dug deeper – calling the school and finding out that the children had not attended in months – that they realised all was not well.
The mother worked in the sex industry and would often disappear for days at a time, leaving the children at home alone and sending money back to them (they were aged 11 and 13) via a taxi so they could sort food and electricity. At one point the 11 year old boy asked Katie if “she went out and got pissed with her son”; he knew Katie had a son the same age as him. Katie realised this child had a very warped view of a parent/child relationship and that she had some re-education to do. Katie built a supportive relationship with this young man over the following years and supported him as he put himself into the care system and subsequently through a couple of difficult foster placements. 
Eventually he was placed in a great foster placement and he has subsequently flourished. He is now in college and is applying to join the Fire Brigade. Over the past few years, Katie has continued to support this young man in her own time and now supports him as an advocate. 
Due to his upbringing this young man would have been naturally suspicious of many adults, but because of the way she has worked with him Katie has built a trusting that has benefited the young man, but one that Katie says she too has benefited from. She says her own life has been enriched and that she has learnt as much from him as she has given to him. To go to these lengths to support someone no longer directly connected to work and to do so out of work time deserves recognition. 
As one of our panel members said, Katie went above and beyond in her role to give a young person a better start in life, which is why this nomination was chosen as a moving example of being able to earn people’s trust.

Values Award: We seek to understand needs and find a way to help



 
September 7, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Values Award: We seek to understand needs and find a way to help
Earlier this year, we asked you to submit nominations for our employee values awards. Once again, we received some fantastic examples and stories of the wonderful work and contributions across PSS. It wasn’t easy but with help of our judging panel, we have chosen our 2015 winners. 
This winning nomination describes how this employee has a great understanding of the needs of PSS and as a result, how he has added value not only within his team but the wider organisation.
Winner: Karol Zwolinski
Karol Zwolinski, seen here on the left, has worked for PSS for over nine years, he currently works within the Wellbeing’s Mi Service as a Project Worker. Karol had established trusted relationships with supporters and understood the importance of treating people as individuals.
As a manager, Karol promoted open and honest communication. He sought advice / guidance to be confident that he was doing everything possible to better understand an individual’s needs, including helping staff through difficult personal circumstances and enabled them to return to work knowing that they were fully supported.
Last year, one of the projects within our Scotland services was experiencing difficulty. We took the decision to temporarily close the service. This was a critical time but thankfully everyone’s hard work paid off. This was certainly a joint effort involving input from many people and Karol was a very important part of this.
Using skills, experience and knowledge he had acquired in his current and past roles, Karol contributed in every way he could including providing support, reviewing processes, training etc. He ensured that he fully understood the areas for development / improvement and was able to recommend the best solutions to move forward – but most importantly he did this with people and not to them.
Being a member of Your Forum and taking part in many health and wellbeing activities / initiatives, Karol is very passionate about employee engagement. Karol also takes the lead in organising our end of year staff party. This takes time to plan, often with limited resources but he has bags of energy and creativity. Whilst meeting the needs of his own role, you can bet that he is still the first to set up and the last tidying up – just happy with the notion that people have had a good time and enjoyed themselves.
If I could bottle Karol’s enthusiasm, I would do this in truck loads. Often a lot of his contributions are behind the scenes (as they say), yet he honestly has no want or need for recognition. I am personally so proud to have a friend as understanding, selfless and caring as Karol in my life. Professionally as his colleague, I think that he is one of our many shining examples of a PSS person who is always willing to go above and beyond to seek to understand needs and find a way to help.

Family Impact at HMP Altcourse: How we support prisoners and their families.





September 1, 2015

Family Impact at HMP Altcourse: How we support prisoners and their families.
As you may know, we run the Visitors’ Centre at HMP Altcourse in partnership with G4S. PSS staff here are part of our Family Impact team and their role includes processing visitors and, crucially, providing information, support and play activities for children while they’re here.
The Welsh Forum
We planned the event in partnership with G4S and I hope that it will give a great opportunity today to network and develop working partnerships.
The aim of this event was to link up prisoners coming up to their release time with services and agencies that might be able to help them and their families adapt to life on the outside.
‘These lads are quite far away from their families, and their home towns’ says Family impact practitioner, Jan Curzon ‘Events like this are so important to help them reconnect with that area and the options available to them, it’d be easy for them to think there isn’t any support available. We want to make sure they’re aware that there is!’
Becky Bloor Steen, Head of Service for Wales added that
‘There were around 12 provider agencies at the event which was attended by around 36 prisoners throughout the day. Many individuals who took the time to visit the event were really surprised at the level of support that was available to them when they leave prison and were genuinely warmed by the fact that people wanted to help them on their journey of rehabilitation into a life free from crime. We were all served a fabulous lunch made by some of the prisoners. These guys also looked after us and provided us with refreshments throughout the day. There was nothing but positive vibes at the event and it was a strong reminder for all of us to seek out the good in people, not to be judgemental and recognise that everyone is making their own way; the best way they know how.’
We also run Family Days at the Visitors’ Centre….
‘We run family days at Altcourse visitors centre every quarter, and they’re such an important thing for both the prisoners and their families. During normal visits everything is very formal and secure but our activity days are much more relaxed and create a much nicer environment for the children to interact with their imprisoned family member. We always put on interesting and unique activities, like the bird of prey trainer coming in. Having a family member in prison is so stressful for everyone involved… We aim to make the day into an experience that the families will remember positively. The team work incredibly hard on these days and their dedication is one of the things that helps make the day so special. They’re currently working on holding a siblings day for young offenders.’
Jan Curzon, Family Impact, Specialist Practitioner @ Altcourse Visitors Centre

Around the globe in 1 afternoon with Spinning World





August 28, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Around the globe in 1 afternoon with Spinning World
The team at Spinning World know that although our work is varied and extremely important, we are often seen disappearing into and out of rooms with clients and its quite difficult to describe exactly what we do. So instead of introducing you to a day in the life of staff members we decided to tell you about the life in a day of some of our clients. Here are 3 client stories written by three different practitioners. To protect everyone’s confidentiality some of the details have been changed but just imagine 2pm on a Wednesday in July when three of our six practitioners are all seeing clients at the same time….
Julie Chan: Psychological Therapist.
I am based within a secondary school in Liverpool and my role is to provide therapeutic support to the students who may have experienced trauma; in particular those from the BME and asylum seeking and refugee community. 
My first appointment is with Salima is a 13 year old British born Bangladeshi referred by school because they noticed her attitude to school work had changed and seemed to lack concentration. Her attendance was also of some concern too. Salima requested the referral as she knew that she was not feeling herself and wanted to talk about it. Her Bangladeshi parents, who now live in the UK, were initially very wary of her accessing support from outside of the family and not particularly happy that her school suggested a therapy service. They did realise that their daughter was struggling though, and commented on her being very teary at home and seemed to be so sad all of the time. They were not aware that Salima was being bullied and racially attacked on her way home from school. In fact when Salima was referred she’d started to self-harm and had feelings of not wanting to be alive.
Fast forward 2 months to the present day, Salima is much more settled and is attending school again. She’s really finding her voice! She’s started to talk about some of the issues that affect her identity as a British born Bangladeshi person. She talks about the discrimination she faces because of her skin colour. She’s aware of the long journey ahead but just for today she is looking forward to her last lesson because she has Art & Design. Salima loves textiles and hopes to become a fashion designer. The school bell rings and before Salima gets up to leave she thanks me and says she’ll see me next week “Bye Miss!”. I have to remind myself that Salima is 13 years of age and a very self-aware young lady. I am impressed by her resilience and her courage as she explores new ways to cope and manage self-harming.
Trish Doocey: Counsellor
Did you know that we have a service in Wigan? I have worked with adult asylum seekers and refugees in Wigan and Leigh for the last few years for Spinning World. This NHS funded work focuses on alleviating the effects of terrible experiences our clients have had in their home countries.
Today I saw Violette who is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When she first started seeing me about a year ago she was only sleeping for two hours each night. She had symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) following the terrible abuse she was subjected to by soldiers. Her flashbacks to the events that were so bad she believed they were happening again. Sometimes she would even smell gunpowder because the memories were so strong. Although things are better now, Violette still has bad nightmares and finds it hard to concentrate on what’s going on around her. It has been a privilege to get to know this brave woman who stood up against the authorities and paid the price for it. She has been grateful for a safe place and plenty of time to talk about what happened and to take some of the sting out of it. There have been tears and laughter.   I have shared what I know about trauma, the best ways to process it, and tools that can help people take control of their lives once again. Violette says that what has been crucial is feeling accepted and not judged for what she has endured. Unfortunately the Home Office don’t believe Violette so she is still battling for the right to stay in the UK and her symptoms continue whilst she is still not safe
In separate box linked by arrow or similar The democratic Republic of Congo is a vast country struggling to recover from Africa’s “World war” which occurred between 1998 and 2003 when up to six million people were killed in direct fighting and as a result of disease and malnutrition caused by it.
It is referred to as the rape capital of the world. Eastern regions are still volatile despite the peace agreement of 2013.
Marina: Specialist Practitioner 
The part of the project I work in is funded by Child and Adolescence Mental Health Team. My role involves using play and expressive arts therapy to help children cope with difficult life circumstances. I see children in primary schools across Liverpool.
When the behaviour of eight year old Daniel deteriorated, the school contacted our service with a requested for therapy. Daniel and his family arrived in the UK from Latvia in 2011. His family like many young families have left the country to seek better life abroad.
From the beginning of our therapy sessions, Daniel aggressive feelings were released through every medium he used. While playing therapeutic board games he would break all the boundaries and expect special privileges. In the sand tray Daniel would smash down in rage everything he built carefully. His paintings afterwards were often covered in dark paints.
As a therapist who is in touch with my ethical self, I had to restrain from any judgement or criticism. Because of my permissiveness and unconditional acceptance of Daniel’s spontaneous play, Daniel was able to express his feelings of anger and rage.
Daniel’s father found a manual job soon after their arrival. He worked shifts. Often resting from work during the day, he was unable to participate in family life. Daniel’s mother who stayed at home to look after the children, felt isolated. Daniel and his younger brother found hard to fit in the new school. They all missed family and friends back in Latvia.   The family troubles culminated one day into a row and a fight between parents. Daniel and his younger brother witnessed all this.
In separate box. A former republic of the Soviet Union, Latvia joined EU in 2004. The global financial crisis hit the country in 2008-2009.   Unemployment was high. More than 15,000 Latvians were registered to work in the UK last year.

A PSS Graduation: Family Impact practitioner Lorna Brookes gets her PHD

A PSS Graduation: Family Impact practitioner Lorna Brookes gets her PHD
Liverpool and many other cities up and down the country are buzzing with graduates this week as students hard work finally pays off. Here at PSS we’re very proud of our own graduate, Lorna Brookes, who’s completed her PHD after 3 years of  hard work and research all while working for the PSS Family Impact service. She told us a little bit about her research and what it’s brought to her work at PSS:
“In 2011 was offered a studentship through the School of Health to study for a full time PhD. As the general subject area was to study vulnerable children so it made perfect sense to take the opportunity to take an in-depth look at the service we offer to prisoners’ children and their families at PSS. This was a full time PhD (3 years). 2011-2014 which i completed whilst simultaneously working at PSS.
My overall aim was to better understand how families affected by parental imprisonment experience support. I wanted to know how they experienced support at PSS, but also how they experienced support in general (from other services they might be in contact with external to PSS, or any support they might get within their community, from family and friends). This was a qualitative study where each participant was given the opportunity to tell their story in detail; prisoners’ children, parents who had been in prison, and community-based parent/carers for children of prisoners were all interviewed.
The title of my research was “Bubbles, Brick Walls and Connectivity. Families affected by parental imprisonment and their experiences of community-based support”.
Participants spoke of feeling isolated and marginalized from society which some conceptualised like ‘being in a bubble’. One child said it was like living in a bubble because people could see her but they didn’t really see her clearly. The bubble of isolation was also provided as a meataphor to describe the environment that these families find themselves in; non-protective, vulnerable to breaking. Participants also described the ‘brick walls’ they experienced which reflected their immense frustrations of being judged and their lack of access to information which affects them. Banging heads against ‘brick walls’ was a commonly used metaphor to describe conflict with statutory services, and conflict with members of their communities and members of their own families. Many stories were told of abuse. The children of prisoners and the non-imprisoned family members told harrowing stories of the physical and mental abuse they had suffered as a result of a crime they themselves had not committed.
The majority of participants interviewed felt that PSS was their only option for support; one woman said “there is no-where else is there!”
The research found that PSS provides excellent support to families affected by parental imprisonment, predominantly because we help our service users to form and maintain meaningful relationships, which in turn helps them to better cope. This is described in the thesis as ‘Personal Connectivity’. The value of the relationships that are built with PSS staff members was spoken of highly, mainly due to the non-judgemental and empathic approach that staff adopt. The value of peers support groups, and the strengthening of relationships within the families by providing opportunities for safe family contact was also highlighted by participants as essential to their coping. Many participants also spoke of their personal growth they had experienced since coming to PSS (becoming peer mentors, helping others, finding a new a positive direction in their lives in spite of the hardship they had suffered).
Ultimately the research highlights that that our service is very much needed and that the focus on building positive relationships with service users and between service users is key. We have learnt that in the main our families was to ‘Be Heard’, ‘Be Safe’, ‘Be Informed’ and ‘Belong’.”
The picture is of Lorna and her daughter Matilda who has, as Lorna puts it: as ‘Endured the struggles of the research process along with me, and deserve the praise of surviving it as much as anyone!” In that case, congratulations  to both Lorna and Matilda from everyone at PSS!

American visitors take a tour of Seel Street
Yesterday saw a group of students from Hope College, Michigan visit PSS as part of their two week visit to the UK. The group, made up of psychology social work and nursing students, are in the UK to research our health and social care services, in particular our mental health services. Hope College US has close links with Liverpool’s own Hope University, and it was through PSS Practice Educator Pam Foy that the visit was arranged.
The students were joined by our Hope University Inclusion group, and by members of our staff throughout the morning including Palliative Care, Family Impact and Shared Lives. Before heading off the group had a spot of lunch and took time out to celebrate the birthday of June from our Service User inclusion group with some cake.
The group are now off to London to take in the sights but we hope they’ll take ideas and innovations from our services back to their work and studies in the US.

Tuesday saw Steven Park and Lee Lewis from our Liverpool Health trainers service descend on London to attend the Digital Health and Care Congress 2015, hosted by The Kings Fund.
The pair took part in the ‘Rapid fire poster session’ which gave speakers just three minutes to talk through their topic, but with a poster to help clarify ideas.
With a lot of ground to cover, Steven wasted no time in describing flo: a system that helps patients to monitor their blood pressure remotely using text messaging.

For The Love of Babies: LivPIP Conference 2015



 
June 17, 2015

For The Love of Babies: LivPIP Conference 2015
Last Thursday saw delegates from as far afield as Perth, Australia descend on Hilton Liverpool for an enlightening day discussing issues surrounding infant mental health and wellbeing. The day kicked off with speeches from our very own chief executive Lesley Dixon, followed my labour MP for Wavertree Luciana Berger, who had some lovely things to say about LivPIP and the work the team do: ‘There is an enormous amount of be proud of here. LivPIP is an example of local action making a difference and changing lives’
LivPIP CEO Clair Rees had an alternative take on the ‘northern powerhouse’ idea being discussed in parliament: ‘getting it right for your children, in your communities… now that’s what I call a powerhouse!’ a comment which caused quite a cheer from a crowd which included midwives, early years practitioners, Doctors and Nurses.
After the first key note speech of the day from Robin Balbernie we moved on to workshops, each covering a different topic around infant mental health. The workshops were diverse and interactive- with the ‘Watch, Wait and Wonder’ group even indulging in a bit of singing!
The afternoon session began with a talk from Dr Amanda Jones that set the tone for another round of workshops to round off the day.
Comments from delegates:
‘The conference was a fantastic opportunity to be able to hear from high profile speakers and I loved being able to network with likeminded professionals and services’
‘The workshops were really interesting and gave me real food for thought to take back to work with me! I’ll be encouraging my colleagues to engage with the 1001 critical days campaign’
The LIvPIP team would like to thank everyone who attended and helped make the day so fantastic

Community Support: Can you help spruce up our allotments?

Community Support: Can you help spruce up our allotments?
As you may or may not  know Community Support have three plots on the Pitville allotments, in Mossley Hill.
Our community support service have recently launched the ‘Green Team’ project, which aims to increase service user involvement in the allotment and community clean up plans.  Our vision aims to use the allotments to give those who use our services enriching experiences and skills that will eventually lead to qualifications and potentially paid employment for those that want it.
We currently have  a small but dedicated team of staff and service users who keep these plots ticking over but they are fighting a losing battle with weeds. Two plots in particular are in desperate need of weeding and tidying.
So that’s where you come in… Are you available to lend a hand  to the green teams on our weeding and tidying mission?
“We’ve realised that if we want the allotments to produce anything this year we need to have the plots ready for the end of June!’ Says Community Support Service Manager Vicki ‘Time is of the essence and any hours you can donate will be much appreciated – we will provide tools, refreshments and eternal gratitude…. you’ll have to provide your own suitable footwear is necessary though!”
The team also have a 5ft by 10ft shed available if anybody is wanting one,  available to any volunteer who needs one.
“All we ask is that you give us some time to fight the weeds.” added Vicki “Please, please, please if you can spare your time and energy contact then get in touch. Further cheeky note, all donations of seeds, gardening equipment etc are always gratefully received.”
If you’re interested in getting involved please contact Gill or John in the Community Support office on 0151 702 5586 or email communitysupport@pss.org.uk

Budding Professors Take Note: Liverpool Hope University Is Offering A PHD Scholarship For The PSS History Project.

Budding Professors Take Note: Liverpool Hope University Is Offering A PHD Scholarship For The PSS History Project.
Liverpool Hope University has an outstanding reputation and commitment to research that shapes humanity, science, and society. As part of their continued pledge to invest in research excellence, the University offers a number of Vice Chancellor Scholarships for PhD research annually.
We already have fantastic links with Hope University, hosting over 50 BA and MA Social Work students on placement each year, our team at Hope have also set up a service user group (pictured above) who play a key role in selection for these courses. Hope Uni scholarships cover all subject areas, and this year we’re honoured to announce that the list includes: ‘The Third Sector in welfare provision: History and development of PSS’
With such a rich history spanning nearly 100 years, research into PSS will take the reader right through the radical upheaval of the twentieth century- from an Edwardian era, the depression, the birth of the welfare state, the turbulent 1980’s and right up to the present day. We hope the project will unearth lost details and provide fresh insight into the PSS’ innovation that kick started Legal Aid, the Citizens Advice Bureau and Shared Lives.
The university invites ‘outstanding applicants of a high calibre to pursue PhD research at Liverpool Hope University in selected areas. We are seeking confident, innovative postgraduates with a record of achievement to undertake a broad range of thematic and inter-disciplinary projects.’
For more information about the Vice Chancellors PHD Scholarships visit the Hope University website

Twitter Chase: Taking Social Media to the streets!
4 teams, 3 hours, 22 people, 51640 steps and over a 100 services visited.
https://storify.com/LiveWellLpool/livewell-liverpool-twitter-chase
Students from Liverpool John Moores, Hope and Edge Hill University came together in teams to see who could visit the most number of activities and services from the LiveWell Liverpool health directory over a 4 hour period, tweeting s they went along.
The event was organised in with Healthwatch Liverpool and aimed to find out more about community activities available in the city. Everyone taking part in the event was promoting LiveWell Liverpool – a health directory with information about activities and services in Liverpool and services provided by Mi.  The staff, students and service users used Twitter to shout about activities they came across in the different areas of Liverpool. The four teams covered either Toxteth, Norris Green, Dovecot and Speke- and it was a great opportunity for these students to discover a new part of the city they might not be familiar with/ 
 
The Twitter Chase was a big success and has caught an attention of other organisations who would like to get involved in future events. The next Twitter Chase will happen at some point in June so get in touch if you’re interested in being involved!’ Karol, The Mi Team

Everything Is Different: A Recovery Journal

Everything Is Different: A Recovery Journal
Dear Reader,
The inspirational stories in this booklet have been shared by people who have improved their mental health and become stronger following incredibly low periods in their lives.
We chose the title ‘Everything is Different’ as it was a phrase that stood out in one of the stories we collected, and we felt it was a really positive message that we wanted to promote. Recovery is fuelled by hope and the stories in this book are proof that positive changes do happen.
I am privileged to witness hope everyday in the success stories of the people we support. These stories are examples of what motivates the team to work with such positivity and passion. By sharing these stories we hope readers will be inspired and encouraged to believe that they too can feel better, that things can be different, if they take the first step. 
My thanks to the five storytellers and to Sue, who is not only an amazing artist but an inspiration to others; this booklet couldn’t have happened without her creativity.
Nicky McGovern
Service Manager: Wellbeing Centres.

Sean Murphy nominated at the National Learning Disability Awards



 
May 17, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Sean Murphy nominated at the National Learning Disability Awards
Sean Murphy Honoured for his work at Rock Grove at the National Learning Disability Awards
Supported Living Manager Jordan Smith tells us what makes Sean stand out:
The Nomination
Sean Murphy is the registered manager for our Rock Grove supported living house. Rock Grove is specifically for over 65’s with a learning disability, and Sean’s excellent work means that I am nominated him for both the Management and the Supporting Older People awards. The awards are in May and a few of us are heading down to the ceremony in Birmingham, it should be a great night to celebrate Sean and the team’s incredible work!
Sean is a great leader and role model to the staff, recently they have been through a really rough time with two people passing away and a third having a terminal illness. He has worked for us for 24 years and has supported older people with LD to live as independently as possible. The high quality care that Sean has been able to provide to the service users has enabled him to support individuals to exceed expectations. He has always been an advocate for their rights and responsibilities but the way that Sean has been advocating for Albert* during his recent Cancer diagnoses means he has gone above and beyond his. 
Sean has made sure Albert has all the care he needs and has been as comfortable as possible throughout. He has ensured that the staff team remained as positive as possible and motivated them to do their best for Albert. It has been extremely difficult as during this period two other Rock Grove service users have also passed away. Sean has gone above and beyond to keep the team motivated and to inspire them to do the best for Albert.
Sean brings experience, compassion, and a cool head with clear leadership. It is clear how much he cares for the service users and the staff.
I feel that Sean deserves to win this award as he is a great leader and role model to the team. Sean always goes the extra mile and has shown his commitment to people with learning disabilities.
What Sean says: 
When  I was first  informed  about   being  shortlisted  for  the  award,  I   felt  very  surprised  because  I  have  never  been  put  forward  in  the  past.  But then I  started  to  feel  a  great  deal  of  pride, not  just  for  myself,  but for  the  team  at  Rock  Grove  who also work  incredibly  hard.

From the archives: Helen Forrester’s 1986 address to our members.



 
May 14, 2015
Eleanor Riley
From the archives: Helen Forrester’s 1986 address to our members.
Helen Forester, best known as author of Twopence To Cross The Mersey, worked for PSS in our early days. A recent trip to the archive unearthed a speech she delivered to our Members some 50 years later in 1986- and she has a fascinating insight into our history.
“Today, I feel that my life has come full circle. It is truly strange to me, to find myself addressing your annual meeting. Fifty years ago- more than fifty- I was the Society’s office girl. A slip of a girl of fourteen- everybody’s dogsbody.I am afraid that today my talk will sound like a muffled voice from the bottom of the pile- like the tentative meow of an office cat.
When I received your kind invitation via Mr Currie, the first thing I did was to read your annual report. It was interesting to see that, though the bias of the work of the society had changed with the times slightly, you were still fulfilling your most important mandate, you are filling the cracks left by the welfare state and more importantly, being a good listener- which civil servants rarely are.
There are so few people left who will listen while you talk your troubles out, fewer still who will try to be impartial listeners. Yet people allowed to talk freely begin to see how to solve their own problems. As an office girl and filing clerk, I used to have to enter rooms where interviews were taking place, in order to find files of other clients pouring into the basement waiting room; and I remember so well the quiet attentiveness of both voluntary and paid staff, as they listened to the rambling stories poured into their ears.
There is no answer to many of life’s woes, they have to be endured They are rooted too firmly in tradition, in the political systems, the current myths and popular beliefs, the inadequacies of the characters involved or just in appalling bad luck. Talking to somebody sympathetic, however, can sometimes alleviate the pain of perhaps circumvent it.
One of the best things in Canada which I have seen of late- and I see that it is also happening in England- is the way in which chronically unemployed people (who have a lot to bear themselves) are volunteering to help the elderly, the sick and the physically and mentally handicapped. It is a movement which can be the salvation of the helper, giving him new dignity and standing in the community and is a wonderful aid to the helped.
I think it means that the ordinary people are beginning to face the reality that we are not just going through a depression which will pass, we are also going through an Industrial Revolution, where vast numbers of hands are mp longer needed in factories or on farms or in transport of mining- or offices- not even in original service industries. We have to find something other than the idea that a man is as good as his wage packet to make our lives meaningful. And until someone comes up with a better idea, there is a lot to be said for voluntary work in areas which the government is not willing to support. 
One scheme which you are undertaking- help the terminally ill in their homes. I wish with all my heart had been available in Canada last year. Against all the customs of the country, I promised my sick husband that I would nurse him at home; he should die in his own place. Our doctors of many years standing deserted- they would not make house calls. The city managed to find me someone to do the washing etc after a fashion. A public nurse visited, but all she could do was cheer the patient up. North Americans simply cannot face the fact of death- they wrap it up, put it away in back wards somewhere in the hospitals. The hospice system hardly exists. Anybody who wants to die at home is crazy and those who look after them are plain nuts. The support of a society like yours would have been an incredible help. More strength to your service. And just while I am on the subject of dying, it is not just a matter of giving on the part of the nurse; the dying return something ineffable to their nurse, a great richness.
To review, when I was a little office girl, I had one advantage. I was working and contributing to the National Health System. I was, therefore, entitled to the care of a general practitioner. Had I been a house wife I would not have received this service. Women at home and children were not covered by the medical services. The result was that our waiting rooms in the Society were crowded, not only by half starved mothers, but with women in dire need of medical attentions, of dental help, of spectacles. They died early, because they ignored their sickness until it was too late, when they would go to the dreaded parish doctor or to a hospitals emergency department.
The society had an arrangement with the Dental Hospital whereby people could save up with the Society a few pennies at a time to get a set of dentures. But for most this was too expensive. People suffered the agonies of toothache, alleviating it with hot bread poultices of oil of cloves. It was common to see people with dreadfully swollen jaws from a septic tooth. 
An indication of the enormous improvement in the standard of living in Britain, despite the huge unemployment, is the fact the crowds of people no longer stink to high heaven. The lack of water, soap and towels was so profound that my strongest memory is of the appalling smell of our crowded waiting rooms. You could cut it with a knife- the sickly smell of bug ridden, lice ridden, unwashed clothes, people with breath so bad it would shrivel a T.V advertisement for mouthwash.
Most of the women sitting patiently a whole morning in our waiting rooms would be wearing a shawl, instead of a coat. A shawl was something that for centuries they had crocheted themselves from a few pence worth of black wool. A coat cost real money. I have not seen a shawl in Liverpool for years.”

Mi Connections: Catching up with our Befrienders

Mi Connections: Catching up with our Befrienders
The Mi Connections befrienders recently gathered at our Seel Street office for a Get-together to meet, exchange experiences, connect and get creative.
Mi Connections currently supports individuals living with dementia as well as people who experience social isolation and loneliness. The PSS team connects each service user with a volunteer befriender who visits them regularly for a chat, to get out and about in the community or simply for a cup of tea and some quality time together. Their support can also provide important respite for family carers.
During the workshop the group had a closer look at the little things befrienders do that can make a big difference to somebody’s day. From “listening” or “talking about memories”, days out at the museum, allowing silence together to “planting the first seeds in spring” and “Go to pub!” – the things they do together are as diverse as the befrienders and befriendees. The PSS team is currently exploring ideas for potential new service offers like email and telephone befriending to add even more possibilities. And they used the opportunity to ask the supporters for their input.
“Some of our befrienders have been connected with their befriendees for years, others are brand new to the service and looking forward to their first visits, and they all have come to us for various reasons and from various walks of life. Their range of perspectives, new ideas and feedback what is going well, what could be improved and what they think abut new service developments is invaluable.”
Project Coordinator Blythe Cooper could also update the befrienders with exciting latest news: Mi Connections has successfully passed the inspection for Approved Provider Status with the Mentoring and Befriending Foundation and is together with Family Impact and Women’s Turnaround being recommended for the quality mark. This is a great success for the befriending service at PSS: “Working towards and achieving the quality mark has helped us to improve the quality of the service”, says Mi Service Manager Sinead Martin, “We are a safer, more efficient and inclusive service as a result of this piece of work and our aim is to double the number of people we support in the coming months.”

Hannah’s Turnaround Story



 
May 13, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Hannah’s Turnaround Story
The Early Years…
On the surface Hannah’s life had been one of affluence. She wanted for nothing; best clothes, best jewellery, best houses, all of which was provided through the proceeds of drugs. Her mother was a drug dealer and gang culture was the norm.
Hannah was eventually removed from her mother’s care at age 10. At 14 she moved in with her boyfriend’s parents and fell pregnant at 16. After a tumultuous few years Hannah separated from the child’s father. The following few months were fraught with difficulties, but eventually Hannah settled down, both baby and mum were well and happy, Hannah was working and had her own place. She’d even met somebody new, a lad from Liverpool who was working in Hull. Things were looking up …until her sister came to stay.
It was the night of Hannah’s 19th birthday, she was working late and returned home to find her sister with a load of people, some of whom Hannah didn’t know. Suddenly she saw blue lights, when she looked outside she saw an armed response team.
Hannah wasn’t involved and was released but social services had decided to remove her child from the home, and they named Hannah’s mother as the child’s legal guardian. She stood on her mother’s step crying and begging, but the only thing this achieved was a violent assault at the hands of her mother that landed Hannah in hospital. She eventually recovered but her mum still refused her access.
Moving to Liverpool…..
Hannah decided her only option was to start a new life in Liverpool, without her son. 3 years later, and with a new baby, Tom , Hannah was ready to fight for her family. But when her now 6 year old son was returned to her, he became violent with his new baby brother. Hannah’s partner left her under the strain and eventually it was agreed that her oldest would go into foster care for the sake of Tom.
It wasn’t long before she embarked on a new relationship with a man who would turn out to be her worst nightmare, Derek. A few months down the line that he’d moved in with Hannah, and soon after this the controlling behaviour started to rear its ugly head, along with involvement in gangs and drugs. Tom’s dad immediately took action to have him removed into his care. Hannah was left with two children that she could only see for one day a month.
In addition to this, soon after she lost Tom, Hannah’s boyfriend called her, to say he wouldn’t be back, that he’d met someone else. Hannah was distraught. When he turned up the following day he was enraged when he saw that Hannah had packed his bags for him. He assaulted her and she required several stitches. In the hospital Hannah did a lot of reflecting on her life and shed many tears over where she’d ended up.
“I remember going to my house a few days after being out of the hospital and the neighbour told me that Derek had been with a van and emptied most of my furniture out of my home. I grabbed what stuff I needed and got out of there. From there I went to a hostel where I stayed for nearly five months, it’s where I spent Christmas without my children and woke up with drug addicts and prostitutes instead.”
It was while Hannah was in the supported accommodation that the Matrix squad turned up at 8am to take her to St Anne Street police station to be charged with cultivating cannabis. She was eventually convicted and received a suspended sentence. Her boyfriend was never charged with anything.
Turning around…
“In January of 2013 I was interviewed to go into Riverside Supported Housing and a few weeks later I was placed in my own one bedroom flat in dovecot. It felt amazing, although it wasn’t as nice as the houses I’d had it was mine and I had my own front door that I could lock.”
Hannah’s offender manager suggested Women’s Turnaround might be able to help her with her current issues. She referred her in and Hannah never looked back.
Hannah engaged well from the outset and with a dogged determination threw herself into every self help programme we ran. She would spend at least 4 days per week on the centre computer filling in applications for jobs. In addition, and to support her application for Support Work, Hannah completed the ‘Mentors’ programme at the Basement, after which she worked for them on a voluntary basis. She’s been doing her maths and English qualification with Mark Soady from Manchester College and is the first woman at the ISIS Centre to pass her English exam.
She has always demonstrated her commitment to moving forward and putting her past life well and truly behind her. She has been proactive when dealing with problems and the turnaround staff describe her as ‘essentially the perfect client ‘ and her outcomes have been far better than expected considering she has a conviction for cultivating cannabis. She has her children staying over weekends and is in a healthy relationship with a man who has repeatedly demonstrated his love and commitment. And, Hannah achieved her dream of becoming a Support Worker after successfully interviewing for Trainee Project Worker for Riverside’s Liverpool Waves of Hope project.
Hannah epitomizes determination and guts and is a shining example of how people can turn their lives around.

Saying goodbye to our Mi Smarthouse!

Saying goodbye to our Mi Smarthouse!
Following its huge success – the Smarthouse at the Museum of Liverpool is now closed. The Smarthouse was a mock house that showed so much of the assistive technology on offer today. Since its launch in August 2013 over 50,000 people have visited the Smarthouse. Every visitor was greeted by the brilliant PSS team there and encouraged to think about how technology can lead to greater independence at home. Opportunities in the Smarthouse gave many of our Champions the opportunity to gain employment and gain valuable skills and experience. Big thanks to Paul, Geoff, Emma and Aimee – the current team – who will be leaving the service at the end of March. But this doesn’t mean our work with assistive technology comes to an end. If you would like to learn more about the opportunities it can offer then please get in touch with the Mi team on 0151 702 5592.

Pets and Pals monthly walk provides Time to Talk

Pets and Pals monthly walk provides Time to Talk
Pets and Pals is a CIC started by one of our very own champions- Richard Adamson. Richard wanted to start a company that facilitated walks (with optional canine companion) around Liverpool’s parks, that give people who attend the space and the freedom to talk openly about their feelings.
‘It’s not just about mental health’ explains Mi Project worker Ryan ‘The project could help people who are isolated or struggling with their feelings too. It’s really just for anyone who wants to try something new and meet some new people… and I guess their dogs too in some cases!’
 The project fits perfectly with the message of Time to Talk day, so it’s no wonder that the walk was particularly well attended as issues surrounding breaking the stigma of mental health were on everybody’s mind. 
The project currently runs monthly walks n Sefton park and Newsham park, usually on the first wednesday of every month. Richard wants to grow the project to cover more parks across Liverpool. 
To find out more about Pets and Pals you can follow them on twitter @petsandpalscic

On the go at Newby House



 
February 12, 2015
Eleanor Riley
On the go at Newby House
The tenants of Newby house have a fantastic programme of activities to choose from,t hey aimed to promote active and healthy lifestyles as well as a sense of community.
The Team at Newby filled us in on a couple of the tenants achievements over the past year:
Nordic Walking – enjoyed by many tenants with staff support. Whilst one tenants gained his community leader badge and other now training to become a Nordic Walking Instructor, enabling him to lead his own groups eventually, whilst  building  his confidence and self esteem.
Cycling activity– We recently had an amazing moment when one tenant rediscovered his cycling skills after not riding a bicycle for 25 years! All other tenants and staff attended a cycling proficiency test to promote outdoor activity and community involvement.
 Arts & Craft –  Many of the products from the art groups are now in Newby House garden of tenants flats for usage.
There are also weekly quiz nights and the occasional tombola organised by tenants and staff to get the Halewood community involved and raise funds!
What the tenants have to say:
John said “Nordic Walking and badminton group has improved my physical health. I also attend a math’s group where my confidence has grown after passing my first ever exam!! I could not have achieved this without the support from staff at Newby House”
David said “Its all go here at Newby House! It has taken me over two years to embrace the maxim ‘A healthy body – A healthy mind’ At first it is difficult to get motivated, although once one gets started and sees the benefits the motivation comes more readily. Here at Newby House we have a well established badminton group playing every Thursday evening, somewhat strenuouly.  I am currently doing an instructors course in Nordic walking which will eventually enable me to set up some new groups in the Halewood area. At Newby House we also have an arrangement with Halewood rangers to use their bicycles so we can enjoy an hours relaxing cycle ride. Currently we are starting a fishing group that several tenants have shown an interest in this. Along with all my physical activities I have enrolled on a couple of academic courses. Two years ago I would never believed I would be capable, able or willing to partake in these, or any other activity. My motivation, besides my decreasing waste line, came mostly from staff here at Newby House. When one knows they can rely on good staff support all the anxiety, paranoia and sense of the unknown can be addressed together.”

Our ‘Turning Around’ conference gives women the chance to share their stories.



 
February 12, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Our ‘Turning Around’ conference gives women the chance to share their stories.
Liverpool Hope University recently played host to a PSS conference with a difference. ‘Turning Around: Women and the Criminal Justice System’ put the people who use PSS services at the centre of the day, and gave them space to speak about exactly what PSS Strengthening Families services mean to them.
During the morning sessions we heard from Turnaround staff Heather and Kim about their innovative work creating The Ruby Project, a domestic abuse intervention service at The Royal Liverpool Hospital. After their introduction we heard from Denise*, a lady who had used Ruby and had gone on to leave her abusive and controlling relationship. It was the first of many moving stories throughout the day.
Next up we heard from the Women using the Women’s Turnaround Service at the ISIS centre. The service helps women who have offended, or who are at risk of offending. The audience agreed it was amazing to hear the women speaking to confidently and eloquently about there lives and experiences, and some even used poetry to tell the audience about their journey. One lady, Jean*, focused her story on her key worker, Lisa, and the amazing work work she does… she also made a point of telling the audience that Lisa deserves a big promotion! And  listening to how positive Jean is after working with Lisa, it’s easy to see why she’s so enthusiastic. Jean’s been through a lot in her life, and says that without the Turnaround service she might not be here today: ‘I’d be six feet under, definitely. I didn’t see any worth in myself or any reason in continuing before I went to the centre’
There was also an opportunity for The Manchester College, who specialise in offender education and also sponsored the conference to showcase the work they’re doing with Turnaround. All the women who took part in the presentation were at completely different stages in the learning process, but the their attitude and desire to learn was visible across the board. Their enthusiasm doesn’t seem to stop when he class ends, and one of the women, Emily*, said that since starting classes she now regularly challenges her partner to long division competitions… ‘and yeah, I always win!”
Lawyer Bernard Byrne leads on Violence Against Women and Girls for Mersey-Cheshire Crown Prosecution Service and joined us to introduce the day.
He said later: “The CPS gets involved with the Turnaround Project mainly around Domestic Abuse cases. If a woman is a defendant in a case and is found guilty, the CPS can apply for a conditional caution that takes account of the fact that she might be offending because she is in an abusive relationship.
“These cautions can include a requirement to engage with the Turnaround team, to get the help they need to support themselves and their families and to end their criminal behaviour.
“The CPS also links up with Turnaround when women come into the Criminal Justice System as witnesses or victims, again particularly in Domestic Abuse cases.  We know that many of these women mistrust the system and worry that their own previous offences might be used as a tool to discredit them in Court.
“Our role here is to reassure them that they won’t be subjected to inappropriate or irrelevant cross examination and then to protect that position in the courtroom.  The Turnaround project has been key in giving women the confidence to participate in the process, to reassure them about what will happen in court and to make sure the system works to protect them and their families from further abuse.”
“Women’s Turnaround service is a unique service for women with complex support need’ says Service Manager Sharon Cooper ‘through creative ways of working with them we are instrumental in helping them take positive steps in changing their lives around!”
All of us at PSS were incredibly proud of all the articulate and confident women who stood up to tell their story. Thank you to all of you for helping us to show how amazing the outcomes of Ruby and Women’s Turnaround can be.

Natalie’s Family Impact Journey



 
January 23, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Natalie’s Family Impact Journey
Natalie has been working with Family Impact for nearly two years after being referred by her social worker for being under the influence of alcohol while looking after her 4 year old daughter, Sophie.
‘I have had problems with both alcohol and drugs since I was 15, I binge drink and take cocaine on a regular basis, usually starting on a Thursday night and going right through until Sunday night.’ 
Natalie has also been in a violent and emotionally abusive relationship for six years and, although her partner is currently imprisoned she still worries about the impact this had on her daughter who witnessed some of the abuse.
‘I first met my family worker before my child protection conference, she explained what support they could offer and I told her what I needed. I felt at ease and listened to and liked the fact that she would support me, Sophie and my mum.’
After the conference Sophie was placed on a child protection plan, and went to live with Natalie’s Mum while Natalie agreed to work with a family worker to help tackle her drug and alcohol problems.
‘I met with my family worker in my home, at PSS offices and also in a local café, I had to complete an assessment and then set targets for myself. Sophie and my mum also met with my family worker and told them how they felt and what they wanted to happen.’ 
Natalie attended the Family Impact workshops looking at self-esteem building, assertiveness and relationship advice, positive communication, stress busting and budgeting.
‘I also completed the 10 weeks nurturing programme which helped me to gain more self-awareness around how my drinking has affected Sophie and my mum. It was good because my family worker delivered this programme and so I was more relaxed and able to talk about things in the group.’
Natalie also accessed other services to help tackle her issues as well as completing the PSS Women’s Turnaround Freedom programme.
‘By my 3 month review meeting, I’d stopped binge drinking and no longer took cocaine. I made some friends in the groups I attended and feel I can talk to them as they know how I feel, I phone them when I need a drink or want to use drugs and they help me work through things.’ 
Sophie is now back staying with Natalie at the weekends and it’s been agreed that she can properly come home next month, Natalie’s mum is attending support group at PSS too and they are getting on better than ever. 
‘I still see my family worker every two weeks and she is always at the end of the phone if I need to talk, I don’t think I would be where I am today without her support and encouragement. Thank you Family Impact.’

Anne’s Family Impact Journey



 
January 23, 2015
Eleanor Riley
Anne’s Family Impact Journey
When her Granddaughter Lauren was born, Anne didn’t except to have the baby living with her after just one week. Anne’s son, Laurens father, was living with her at the time and they took Lauren in as her mothers alcohol issues proved too much. Anne and her son both raised Lauren together, although she did see her mum sometimes.
But when Lauren was nine years old her mum disappeared for several months. When she came back she promised Lauren the world but failed to deliver every time. Social services eventually got involved and saw no problem in Lauren staying with Anne. Anne however, was starting to feel like she needed support of her own.
‘When social services made a referral to the Family Impact, it was the best things they ever did for us. Straight away I felt such relief has I finally had someone on my side. They have helped me enormously over the years and I am forever grateful to them for their support, nothing is too much trouble for them.’
Lauren has been diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome and has other problems, meaning that care duties are ongoing for Anne even though Lauren is in her early twenties. Anne describes projects like PSS Impact as a lifeline and is so grateful for their continued support, even though Lauren is too old to officially be part of the Impact project.
‘Only with the help from PSS Impact have I been able to carry on. PSS do a tremendous amount for the children most of all but the Kinship Carers meetings are also really important to me as I no longer feel like I’m on my own. I have made good friends with other carer’s who attend the group. As they understand my feelings and worries as they also experience similar things. I can be myself and talk openly and honestly without feeling judged.’

Supporter’s Award Winners



 
December 16, 2014
Rachael Stott
Supporter’s Award Winners
All PSS people know it’s important to live our values, and all around us we can see examples of people going the extra mile to encourage independence, recognise potential, understanding needs and improving what we do. But it’s not only our paid staff who manage to work and live by these values, and each year we take time to recognise our amazing supporters and volunteers that go the extra mile for us and our service users. These awards were presented by Lesley at Hope University’s Creative Campus on the 2nd of December. Here’s what makes this years winners so special…
We seek to understand needs and find a way to help: Joint Winners
Fiona Stonehouse supports the work of our PND & LivPIP services. This winning nomination demonstrates how an individual has found a real need for people who may be experiencing similar difficulties they have in their own lives and creatively found a way to help: Fiona has experienced Post Natal Depression and had learnt through her own illness that financial hardship can also impact on a person’s emotional wellbeing. As a way to help, Fiona began collecting baby clothes and other items such as cots, prams and highchairs. She quickly spread the word that she was collecting for the mums and dads accessing our service, and her house began to look a bit like a John Lewis store- constantly filled with items of people donating their unwanted goods.
Fiona also washes all the donated baby clothes and sorts them by age and gender. By creating the Facebook page (PND Aware), people now contact Fiona to arrange dropping goods off or to meet up at the different groups around the city. These groups are varied including “The Sling club” and breastfeeding groups, where Fiona meets Mums from all over and promotes our services. We have had some great feedback from those who have been struggling to make ends meet and how Fiona has helped to find the items they desperately need.
Fiona has now started an eBay shop to sell some of the items that have been donated to raise funds for the PND Service which will allow us to put events on for those being supported by our service. Fiona does this all in her own time and with little ones in tow – she is a mum of three, a wife and an inspiration to many. She is a kind hearted woman who has had to deal with her own illness and yet she has found strength to do all of this for others in need.
Kev Evans is one of our Health Champions with the Barnsley Health Trainer Service. For over 2 years, he has organised and facilitated the twice weekly football group and has rarely missed a session. He has endeavoured and ensured that over 20 (previous sedentary) men are taking part in at least 120 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week. The service is in no doubt from the feedback received that this group would have folded a long time ago if it wasn’t for Kev. He has also arranged friendly matches for the men against other opposition, which keeps everyone focused, motivated and interested, by giving them something to aim towards.
More recently, Kev gave more of his free time to help us organise our coast to coast challenge including arranging a sponsorship from his own employer (Indesit) to cover the hire charge of a support vehicle which saved us over £500. Kev also took an active role in ensuring clients turned up to training rides, felt comfortable during rides, offered peer motivation and support as well as getting clients through the tough times of the challenge. In addition to the above, he also raised over £700 which he donated to the services cause of trying to refurbish a free community gym at their local base. Kev often goes that extra mile and takes on further responsibility to help free up staff time to deliver other types of activities and raise invaluable funds towards the work we do. Kev’s drive and determination to help us succeed is definitely his WOW factor.
We encourage independence and choice
Barbara Strong is a regular Befriender Supporter within our Mi Service. Barbara has been able to bring her own qualities, attributes and knowledge to the service to really encourage independence and choice for the people we support.
Barbara’s approach to providing befriending support and company to a person living with dementia is truly person-centred: she has got to know the person very well and structures her time with the service user around his wishes, preferences and needs. The person she is currently befriending, Bob*, loves being out and about and Barbara takes long walks around Liverpool with him and arranges visits to places of interest to provide a different exciting experience every time.
As a committed and punctual befriender, Barbara’s regular visits promote Bob’s independence as without them he would not have been able to travel around Liverpool, visit the places he loves and to take part in a variety of activities – from art sessions and pottery to reminiscence therapy. Barbara uses her resourcefulnessto gt Bob involved in a range of exciting activities. She is a strong and sensitive communicator with a deep understanding of communication needs of those living with Dementia. Barbara also offers a “listening ear” to Bob’s carer who relies on her visits for much needed breaks. Barbara’s voluntary befriending support has had a significant positive impact  on Bob’s life and his carer, and has enabled Bob to maintain independence and live well with Dementia.
We recognise potential
Some of you may recall the names of those mentioned within this winning nomination as they previously featured in our last Summer edition of the Loop.
They are Bev Adams, Michael Agnew, Alan Bond, Dean Forshaw, June Forsyth, Ronnie Hughes, Dot Ogden, Frances Phillips, Karl Porter, Joanne Robinson, Patricia Stoll and Sharon Young who are also known as ‘The Service User and Carer Group’ who support the work of PSS at Hope University and have been nominated for recognising potential. The group are involved in the recruitment and assessment of social work students and professionals at Hope University and PSS. They each have a special connection to the work we do and choose to give back by their ongoing commitment to the work of our partners at Hope and by being true ambassadors for PSS. It is clear from meeting members of the group what type of bond they have. Most are either currently supported by PSS or have been in the past so having that first hand experience allows the group to bring a different perspective on what attributes a candidate needs to be successful. It is clear that motivation to be part of the group have come from the want to give something back. As one member said ‘we all bring something individual to the group and it just works’.
One of the original members to the group explained ‘I take my role very seriously as I look at the students coming in as they could be my daughter or other family member and you want to make the right decisions by them’. The group also act as peer supporters for one another and explain themselves that by being part of this has really helped their self esteem and confidence. One of the newest members of the group simply said ‘I just love it, it gives me something to look forward to and I can’t get enough of it’.
We try to get even better at what we do
Ann Hedges has been a Peer Supporter for our Wellbeing Centres for many years. Ann is a great example of how someone has made the journey from being supported by the work we do to actively and passionately supporting the work we do.
Ann has been always giving time and effort to increase the activities offered to other service users. She has facilitated our craft group which includes showing people how to knit and crochet as well as how to create and paint glass, clay pots, Christmas logs and much more. Ann has recently graduated in Complimentary Therapies and has immediately offered her time and skills providing weekly aromatherapy massages and reflexology sessions for the benefit of the people we support.
Ann has worked hard in developing her own skills while keeping well in herself. She genuinely wants to be better at what she does, wants to improve the service and wants others to develop their independence. In her recent role of a PSS digital champion, Ann has taught people how to use computers and tablets including how to set up email, Skype and the ability to navigate the Internet with confidence. Ann was also a member of a recent digi book club project reviewing online self help packages. Her support was invaluable to the project and went above and beyond, a quality she displays in everything she does.
During one session, Ann managed to find a copy of a treasured book that someone had lost – a gift from their mother. The book was ordered and given to the service user who shed lots of joyful tears. Ann’s care and compassion is a huge asset in helping others and she goes the extra mile to make us better at what we do.
We will earn people’s trust
Debra (a.k.a Debbie) Smallshaw supports the Altcourse Visitors Centre as a Mi Champion. Debbie is a prime example of how one of our very own PSS people has been able to earn the trust of our colleagues and the people we support.
Debbie has become a familiar face to many visitors and has built trust and positive relationships over her time supporting the service. She has a really good understanding of how coming to the visits centre can be a daunting experience for individuals, families and children.
Having undertaken extra training for her supporter role such as hidden sentence training, she really understands the importance of visits not only for the family but also for the offenders. If someone is visiting for the first time, Debbie is ready to answer questions, help explain information and signpost them to relevant services that can make their lives easier.
Debbie is always enthusiastic about assisting with and facilitating children’s activities and understands the importance of enhancing the children’s wellbeing and ensuring that the centre is an enjoyable safe place to be. She interacts with the children by playing games in the family garden, takes part in art and crafts in the visitor centre and even finds time to support the prison family days which are often full day events.
The value added to the visits centre by Debbie is immeasurable. Having a friendly face, quick answers to questions and fun activities for children can make what can be a scary experience a more pleasant one.
We are delighted to announce that since this nomination was submitted, Debbie has been successful in obtaining a Play Worker role with the PSS Family Impact Service. We are sure Debbie will continue to be a fantastic addition to the Altcourse team. 
We’re brave enough to take risks
Richard Adamson is a regular supporter for our Mi Service. This winning nomination talks about how one person has become an inspiration and motivator for those who require / receive support in and outside of PSS.
Richard’s journey with us has gone from strength to strength. He worked to overcome his own difficulties with the help of our wellbeing centres and following this, came on board as a Mi Champion to support others to take charge of their own mental health needs. Richard had the idea of starting his own Community Interest Company and our role was to help him develop this. As a result ‘Pets n Pals’ was created. Pets n Pals promotes the health and wellbeing effects of pet ownership on mental health. This now involves two monthly dog walks (in Sefton and Newsham Park), open to dog owners and dog lovers alike, providing a space where people can interact with dogs, as well as have an open forum to discuss their own mental health journeys.
Richard’s bravery in setting up the above, taking charge of his own career, and stepping out into and engaging with his own community to talk about his own mental health journey demonstrates the risks he is willing to take in order to achieve the success he wants. Richard has also since secured St Michaels funding towards this great initiative. Although it is becoming more of a focus in today’s society, talking about mental health is still a fairly taboo subject. Lots of people shy away from discussing any mental health problems they may have experienced in the past for a variety of reasons, but Richard has chosen to be an example of honesty, openness and bravery in not only discussing his mental health journey with his community, but also to build an interest company around it. By doing so, he is able to pass on the knowledge he has learned about dealing with his wellbeing as well as create a welcoming and open space for others to do the same.
Our new award for 2014
This year we received a special nomination for a lady that we have come to learn a lot about over the last couple of years. Her name is Edna Clements and she supports the work of our Wirral Shared Living Scheme.
It was clear as part of our PSS Supporters Event last year the commitment and compassion which Edna has for the service. She also agreed recently to appear in our new Supporters Recruitment Pack speaking about why she gives her time to PSS and inspiring others to do the same. We were also aware from a previous nomination received for Edna that her aunt was a tenant with John Willis House but unfortunately passed away. A colleague had commented how brave it was for Edna to continue supporting the service afterwards and although this must have been extremely difficult, Edna would say that it was about the tenants and not her.
What makes this nomination special is that Edna has been able to incorporate all of our values into the support she has provided and continues to provide to the service. Edna actively promotes the tenants idependence by organising a variety of activities and trips to suit the varied preferences, she consults with the tenants for their views and ideas and will do her very best to accommodate these. This promotes general well being and self esteem, Edna encourages the tenants to take ownership as much as possible.
Edna demonstrates a fantastic understanding of the tenants as well as an awareness of the impact that social isolation and loneliness has for many older people and the benefits that social group activities can bring in promoting a quality of life. Edna’s happy and outgoing personality naturally gives a lift to the activities and groups she organises. She will always make time for a tenant offering a good listening ear whilst showing care, empathy and compassion to all. The tenants often confide in Edna knowing that she will respect their confidentiality which helps the tenants because very often talking about a problem helps to solve it. She respects and understands the diversity of the individuals we support and the staff team have complete trust in Edna knowing that she acts responsibly and mindfully at all times.
Edna has improved the quality of life for many of the tenants through reducing social isolation, creating and developing a community spirit within the sheltered schemes, organising activities that include all of the schemes encouraging a further wider community within the tenants’ groups. The service has continuously said that they don’t know what they would do without her. From all of the above, we recognised the potential as an organisation to create a new ‘all round’ Values Award for 2014 which deservedly goes to Edna.

Sue’s art takes pride of place



 
December 15, 2014
Rachael Stott
Sue’s art takes pride of place
“I struggle to verbalise some of my thoughts and feelings and art is the voice I use to convey them”.
Back in August The Keeling room in our Seel Street offices became host to over 30 beautiful artworks by Sue White. Wellbeing centre manager Nicky McGovern told us: “Sue was referred to us 4 years ago and attended anxiety management and depression groups. She later went on to undertake peer mentoring training which gave her the confidence to co-facilitate some art journaling workshops with Nikki Greig. Sue now facilitates art journaling sessions independently and they are deservedly very popular with large waiting lists”.
“I found that creating and expressing my feeling through different art, colour, texture and medium is cathartic and helps me improve my health. After completing the course I loved it so much I started to mentor others in art journaling, as at this stage I wasn’t sure if could cope with running a class on my own so I co facilitated with Nikki Greig, and this gave me a great deal of confidence”.
On the day of the exhibition Sue was there to chat to Seel Street staff and invited guests about the work on display, and Nicky from the wellbeing centres brought along some light refreshments. Sue managed to sell 5 pieces and received 5 commissions.
“I believe everyone can enjoy being creative regardless of background, experience or ability”
Some examples of Sue’s work:


Sue helped design the PSS rebrand a few years ago, PSS Christmas cards and is currently working on the design of the PSS Wellbeing Centres Recovery Journal.

Cook well, Be well!
November saw our Barnsley staff take part in a staff wellbeing day organised by Suzanne Storey. Everyone was split iup nto four teams, with each team assigned a leader and one box of food. The boxes were varied in content and included a food bank box, vegetable box, a fish box and a meat box but the challenge was the same for each team: create culinary delights. The winners were Gareth Roberts team who had the Veg box, which included Chloe, Darren and Helen. It was enjoyed by all and the team hope to replicate the workshop isome form at other PSS offices to launch the Cook Well Be Well brand.

Leigh does her bit for her local hospital



 
November 5, 2014
Eleanor Riley
Leigh does her bit for her local hospital
Leigh McNeill and her Shared Lives support worker Linda are spending their time together providing information to the public to help prevent the spread of healthcare associated infections (HAI).
Leigh is a member of Motherwell volunteers at Wishaw General and Monklands Hospitals where she maintains hospital information points making sure they are stocked with the latest information on a number of issues including HAI information.
Leigh did her bit during Infection control and prevention week which fell on 20-26 October by making sure the stands were well stocked with HAI information.
The week has become a regular feature in the healthcare calendar and is used to remind everyone about the importance of taking the necessary steps to prevent the spread of infection.
Leigh, who has learning difficulties, is supported by her support worker Linda Magee from Coatbridge.
Linda Magee said: “Leigh really enjoys her job and is it’s always rewarding when you know that your efforts are helping to make a difference.”
Lisa Roy, primary care infection control nurse said: “More people are increasingly aware of the importance of infection control and hand hygiene issues, but there is no room for complacency.
“That’s why the work of Leigh is very important as it helps us to remind everyone of their responsibilities and to practice good hand hygiene at all times.”
Rick Edwards, patient information manager, said: “Leigh has been volunteering with us for almost five years and her help has been invaluable in making sure we provide this key information to educate and inform the public.
“We are truly grateful to Leigh and Linda for their on-going support.”

‘Our Stories’ PND DVD: On sale now!



 
October 31, 2014
Rachael Stott
‘Our Stories’ PND DVD: On sale now!
Yesterday we launched our Post-Natal Depression service’s new DVD ‘Our Stories’. The film was screened at FACT in Liverpool and our PND service’s ambassador Denise Welch kindly attended to share her story in person.
The DVD which has been produced for both professionals and people experiencing PND has four segments which look at the experience of PND, Support, Dads and Our Service in Liverpool.
Produced by award-winning not-for-profit company First Take we hope the DVD gives an insight into the experiences of men and women with PND, helping them to understand the condition more and to raise awareness of this challenging experience.
In the film, Denise, who suffered PND after the birth of her son, urges women to seek help and not be put off by any perceived stigmas around mental health issues in what has been described as an ‘invisible illness.’
The DVD also features PND sufferer Kate Smith who now works for us and Mark Williams, founder of Fathers Reaching Out, a charity working with dads suffering from PND.
We’ve released the DVD after findings published in a study commissioned by the Maternal Mental Health Alliance found the long-term effects of poor mental health for new mothers cost the UK more than £8 billion a year.
The film aims to raise awareness of PND and what parents think helped them to recover. You can watch our brief advertisement for the film on YouTube now, this features clips from the film and details on how to order a copy. Please share this with your networks – far and wide! 
The DVD also features a recording of a play about PND that was performed by sixth form students from St Julie’s High School in Woolton. The play was used as their final exam piece and received great feedback by examiners.
The screening was followed by a question and answer session where the team were congratulated on their hard work.
The DVD is now available to health professionals across the country in an effort to ensure women and their families are getting the help and support they need. If you’d like to order one or multiple copies please call our team on 0151 702 5589 or email pnd@pss.org.uk. We are happy to offer bulk discounts to organisations wishing to make multiple purchases for their team.
All proceeds from the DVD sales will be used to further expand the support we offer in Liverpool and our wider campaign to raise awareness of PND across the UK.

“I’m thrilled to share my story on this DVD, it allows us to tell anyone experiencing pnd not to be frightened or embarrassed and to give medical professionals an insight into the experiences of their patients. It gives anyone watching the opportunity to reflect and think ‘you know what, we can do more’.”
Denise Welch, Actress and Ambassador.

Film shines a light on post natal depression in effort to reach out to others

Film shines a light on post natal depression in effort to reach out to others
A powerful film exploring the reality of living with post natal depression and featuring sufferers’ stories (PND) will be launched by social enterprise PSS in Liverpool this week.
The film, being screened at FACT, highlights the problems experienced by people who have struggled with PND, including celebrity Denise Welch, who has spoken publicly about her struggles with the debilitating condition.
In the film, Denise, who suffered PND after the birth of her son, urges women to seek help and not be put off by any perceived stigmas around mental health issues in what has been described as an ‘invisible illness.’
It also features PND sufferer Kate Smith who now works with expectant and new mums for PSS and Mark Williams, founder of Fathers Reaching Out, a charity working with dads suffering from PND.
It comes after findings published in a study commissioned by the Maternal Mental Health Alliance found the long-term effects of poor mental health for new mothers cost the UK more than £8 billion a year.
The film aims to raise awareness of PND and what parents think helped them to recover. Health professionals from across the city, including GPs, health visitors, midwives and children’s centre staff are expected to attend the screening on Thursday, 30th October.
Attendees will also get a chance to view a recording of a play about PND that was performed by sixth form students from St Julie’s High School in Woolton. The play was used as their final exam piece and received great feedback by examiners. Sue Doherty, the play’s author, will also be available to answer any questions about the production.
The screening will be followed by a question and answer session and the film will then be made available to health professionals across the country in an effort to ensure women and their families are getting the help and support they need.
Julie Rawlinson, PND service manager for PSS: “The film we have produced is extremely powerful and we are all very proud of it and are looking forward to the screening.
“PND is a very serious issue that can affect any parent regardless of age, race or religion. If left untreated, the relationship between mother and baby can be affected which can have a long standing impact.
“However this can be turned around if they are supported early on, saving a great deal of heartache as well as resources in picking up the pieces.

Women’s Turnaround Research

Women’s Turnaround Research
On the 28th June 2013, the Centre for Public Health launched the Evaluation of the Liverpool Women’s Turnaround Project: Moving forward report.
The Turnaround Project was developed two and a half years ago to support women involved in the Criminal Justice System (CJS) and for women at risk of offending. The project was one of a number of women-focused community centres set up across the UK following a review of women with vulnerabilities in the Criminal Justice System. This review found that criminal justice provision is focused on the needs of male offenders and hasn’t adapted to meet the needs of the increasing numbers of women in prison.
Turnaround is a female only service, designed to fit the needs of women, address attitudes and behaviours, divert women away from prison, reduce family breakdown and improve wellbeing. Turnaround provides services and support for offending, accommodation, skills and employment, health, drugs and alcohol, finance, children and families, attitudes and behaviour, domestic abuse and sex work.
LJMU began their work with Turnaround in 2012 when the Centre was commissioned by Liverpool Primary Care Trust to evidence the holistic benefits of the project. They wanted to know how the project impacts on women’s lives and what women gain from accessing the project. LJMU conducted the evaluation over six months; carrying out an analysis of data collected at the service and speaking to women attending the project in focus groups and one to one interviews. The turnaround staff also collected a number of individual case studies that allowed the researchers to follow women through their time at the project.

Life with Clare and Chris

Life with Clare and Chris
Clare Saunders developed a passion for the caring profession whilst running a residential home for older people with learning difficulties. She lived in the home, where she had responsibility for nine people whom she got to know inside out. Following a change in her personal circumstances she moved to Staffordshire with her two sons and daughter and was approached by a social worker friend who asked if she would like to be involved in ‘adult placement’ as Shared Lives was then known. Clare seized the opportunity and she underwent a period of training with PSS. An introduction to Chris, a man with Down’s Syndrome, followed and Chris has been living in Clare’s family home during the week ever since, returning home to his family at weekends.
“We have a fantastic situation that has not only benefited Chris but my family too,” said Clare of Armitage, Rugeley. “As well as us getting to know Chris very well, he knows all about us. I think this is really important for an equal relationship as when I worked in residential care, it always struck me that I knew everything about the people in my care but they knew nothing about me.”
Clare also provides day care for several people with learning difficulties and offers respite over the weekend to enable people caring for relatives with special needs to have a break.
“I take care of everything, from doctors and hospital appointments to administering medication and organising social events,” continued Clare. “I got lots of support and continued training from PSS and there is always someone at the end of the phone if I need a bit of advice.
“I have been helping one of the people I care for to develop their social skills to enable them to live more independently. This has been incredibly rewarding as is all of my work. I don’t think people are aware of Shared Lives but I think it is fantastic and benefits everyone involved. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.”

Feeling positive about me



 
October 28, 2014
Rachael Stott
Feeling positive about me
The effort that our people put into changing the lives of others is truly amazing and every once in a while, we’ll hear a story or get a thank you that makes us smile and think ‘you know what, we’re making a difference’. That moment came for Jalal Alrakami from our Liverpool Health Trainer team over the Summer.
Dear Jalal,
 
I know you have all my statistics on your laptop… a 16% drop in my weight, a 600% increase in the amount of veg I’m eating and a 100% drop in my fried food intake, but as a mathematician I know statistics cannot tell the whole story. So, I want to say a HUGE ‘thank you’ for turning my life (or rather lack of it) around. This is an incredible feat in just a few months. When my doctor did my health MOT in late 2012 and diagnosed multiple health issues (including obesity, limited mobility in my neck and shoulders, high cholesterol plus a risk of diabetes) my reaction was that I didn’t really care; I didn’t believe I could do anything positive about it. 
 
Since resigning my job to care for my husband, then my mum, then my dad I hadn’t bothered about myself and after their deaths I just gave up. A typical day was to get up late, eat something friend and watch TV. I hardly moved off the settee and lived on the cheapest food available – ‘value’ microwave meals, BOGOF deals (always sausages, pies, burgers, bacon, crisps, biscuits) and chips from the ‘chippy’ so often even the owner remarked on it. Everything was fried; it’s quick and easy when you’re cooking for one. Also it was quite normal to eat a full packet of biscuits, a kingside/due chocolate bar and cripss as I watched TV for hours. I slept erractically and badly. I was ALWAYS tired, I had no energy and no interest in anything. If a friend suggested a film or coffee I always made excuses. Though I was aware of how I looked I didn’t care. I had no motivation to change at all. Sometimes I did feel I was letting my husband and parents down, they’d lost their lives but I was throwing mine away. Then I saw your leaflet, gave you a call and a miracle began. 
 
You gave me the motivation, the support and encouragement, kept me on track, listened and gave good, realistic advice. You understood my financial constraints and helped me source affordable, healthy food. you arranged a GP referrals so that I could swim, attend AquaRunniny, Tai Chi and the gym (none of which would have been possible without this scheme. You are responsible for transforming me from the hefty, lethargic lump that 
shuffled into the surgery earlier this year to someone who cooks meals from scratch, who eats lots of fruit and veg, who never fries anything, who can’t wait for Mondays and AquaRunning or Tuesdays for Tai Chi, who swims three times a week and walks nearly every day, who sleeps much better, gets up at 7am, who goes to events in the park, films and concerts (lots free or much reduced if you search) and hardly stops talking!
 
Everyone comments on the massive improvement in my physical appearance, health and attitude to life. The latter enables me to improve the former and this is due to you Jalal. You are changing my mental approach to life and health and altering my behaviour. I know there is still a way to go but I actually think, with your continued help and support I can do it. It is the first time in five and a half years I have felt so positive.
 
Thank you so much Jalal,
 
Yours, in gratitude.
 
Jo

Jane and her family



 
October 28, 2014
Rachael Stott
Jane and her family
Jane Williams is one of our North Wales Shared Lives carers and she lives in her remote Denbighshire home with her husband Heddwyn and three men who all have varying levels of learning difficulties. The family are very close and do everything together, whether it be eating, socialising or holidaying.  Their home has an array of animals including chickens, dogs, horses and a grey parrot and everyone ‘mucks in’ to help our. The men Jane cares for all love to help run the house and they ensure everything ticks over. “I have been involved in a caring role for many years and also look after my husband who has mental health problems”. Jane also volunteers for her local branch of mental health charity MIND and like all of our carers, always puts others first.
“I have a big house and had previously worked in a supported landlady role for tenants needing more care. When PSS began operating in the area and running a Shared Lives scheme, it seemed like a natural progression as I had the space, the time and the patience.”
“I have two men who live with me and a third man who is staying on a temporary basis. We live together as a family and share our lives. The men I care for have families who they see on a regular basis. My husband and I often get invited to their family celebrations and the men come along to our family events.”
“I don’t think many people realise that this service exists but it is a terrific way for a person to work within their own home, whilst receiving a fee and lots of training and support.
“Lots of women particularly have lost their jobs in the last few years and becoming a Shared Lives carer is a great way to earn a living if you are a caring, patient person.
“I couldn’t imagine living any other way and I believe that the benefits for vulnerable adults living in a home environment are huge, really helping to improve their quality of life. It is very rewarding work.”

A Day on the Farm and by the Sea!



 
October 27, 2014
Rachael Stott
A Day on the Farm and by the Sea!
On Saturday 10th August the Wales team arranged a fun day and picnic in Llandudno for Carers and Service Users. Originally the idea had been for the team to meet up with the Staffordshire group (who were also in Llandudno on that day) but unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, this didn’t happen. However, both groups still enjoyed a lovely day out and here are their stories…
A DAY ON THE FARM:
The Wales group all met at the car par at Bodafon Farm at 12pm and once everyone had arrived they all went to the farm to have look around and those who wanted to enjoyed a refreshing ‘cuppa’ at the cafe. The group had a look around the birds and animals and walked around the farm, but the most exciting part of the visit was a tractor ride around the farm and into the fields; it was rather bumpy and everyone had to hold on tight but they thoroughly enjoyed it!
By now everyone was quite hungry and they decided that seeing as it was such a nice day, they’d take their picnic down to Llandudno promenade and eat it there.
Everyone had a lovely day and agreed that they’d be going back to the farm again as they have a fantastic BBQ with locally sourced food.

Oh We Do like to Be beside the Seaside
On the 10th August the Staffordshire team took their carers and people who use their services on a summer event to remember. First thing on the Saturday morning thirty people boarded a specially booked coach and travelled the few hours from the Midlands to Llandudno. As though it had also been booked, the sun was shining and everyone was looking forward to the day of fun ahead.
Over the course of the day there were no concrete plans. It was important to the team that everyone used the time as they wanted to. For their lunches some people took a picnic to the beach and others went for fish and trips. To keep themselves entertained the group split up and took part in lots of activities including a boat trip, a paddle in the sea and a trip along the pier.

Spinning World Research
Liverpool is the point of initial accommodation for asylum seekers in the North West and currently accommodates almost 23 percent of all asylum seekers in the region (Citysafe’s Annual Plan 2013 – 2014). In 2012-­‐13 there were 153 female asylum seekers dispersed to Liverpool (source: Refugee Action). An estimated 500 asylum seeking and refugee women live in Liverpool (extrapolated from Home Office data); 61 (estimated 12 percent) were seen by Spinning World in 2012-­‐13 and 92 (estimated 18 percent) were surveyed in this research project. The North West Strategic Migration Partnership (2011) asserts that better services in mental health would mitigate the risk of destitution among asylum seekers; those destitute in Merseyside in 2011 numbered over 300.
 Spinning World clients have experienced Human Rights abuses and trauma or the impact of traumatic events that may have happened to other members of their family. Issues may be around trauma and post traumatic stress disorder, sexual violence and pregnancy torture or bereavement. Clients bring issues about living in exile such as depression, anxiety, racism and sexuality. Spinning World specialises in psychological therapies that are sensitive to differences in culture and diversity and the majority of its sessions include trained interpreters. Spinning World was funded by Comic Relief to work specifically with women over 18. A requirement of the project was to evidence the needs of women asylum-­‐seekers in Liverpool both as a rationale for the work and to enable PSS to scale the project in future. The investigative project was awarded to Cernis Limited, a small company established in 2008 with the aim of improving public services through applied research and focused action.

World Mental Health Day

World Mental Health Day
October 10th saw events happening all over the globe for World Mental Health Day 2014. Here in Liverpool, the city was buzzing thanks to an exciting programme put together by Liverpool Mental Health Consortium.
PSS was right at the centre of it with a stall in Williamson square, a hub for the day and the site of several exciting performances. The day kicked off with a speech from ex lord Mayor of Liverpool Gary Miller, who spoke candidly about his Mothers experience of mental health problems during the course of her life.
This set the tone for a day that was all about bringing issues surrounding mental health out of the shadows to shed the stigma that has historically stopped people seeking help.
Our stand encouraged the public to share the ways that they #staywell, and we received some intriguing tips throughout the day. Techniques ranged from yoga and eating well right through to chocolate and 77p kindle books.
There was lots going on down at Seel Street too, and activities there began bright and early at 8.30am sharp for a mindfulness session aimed at preparing yourself for a busy day ahead. Luckily, there was a second session at 10.30am for those people who find that a lie in is a good way to stay well!
There was yet more art on display in Seel Street too as artists who work across the Wellbeing centres and the Bluecoat galleries came together for the ‘Journeys through art’ Exhibition. The Walls in Seel street have never looked better.
Sue White, the lady responsible for the works in the Keeling room, was on hand to deliver an art journaling taster session in the afternoon too, providing attendees with one of the ways the Wellbeing centres help their service users to stay well.

When Perseverance Pays Off



 
September 12, 2014

When Perseverance Pays Off
Only a couple of years ago the PSS Postnatal Depression team were spending their time chasing the local and national press, trying their best to raise their profile and get some funding to continue their amazing work. Their success came at the 11th hour, when a phone call from the then Primary Care Trust told them their funding was secured for another 12 months. Much celebration ensued and with it Julie Rawlinson, the service’s manager decided that she never wanted to be in that position again.
Over the last 18 months Julie has worked with the team to apply for funding, extend service delivery, find a unique selling point for their service, raise their profile and tell their many success stories. Why? Because Julie and the team know how important this service is to the hundreds of women they work with directly in Liverpool each year and remotely through their Twitter, Facebook and website support groups.
At the beginning of August the team found out that they were one of only two services nationally to receive funding from the ‘PIP’ UK (Parent Infant Psychotherapy) fund. This early years intervention fund supports work that builds an attachment between children and their parents when and where issues exist. Before this announcement there had only ever been PIP funded projects in the South of England and for Julie’s team to get this money is an incredible achievement.
The team are always expanding on what they do, looking at how they can make it better, different, easier for service users to engage with. They have a committed team of volunteer supporters who work incredibly hard to make the service the success it is. The team also spend a lot of time looking at the issues from the point of view of people using the service. Within this they saw a gap for Post Natal Depression training in professionals and setup a training course which sees attendees from all over the UK attending this one day course to learn more from not only the practitioner team but also staff members like Kate Smith who share their own personal stories of PND. In October the team will take another step into the unknown delivering the UK’s first PND Conference in Liverpool. With speakers from Public Health, men’s specialists in male PND and a leading Clinical Psychologist on the panel the standard is certainly high.
“This just proves, as we keep telling our mums and dads…. you should never give up!”
Pauline McPartland, Team Leader

From a Seed of an Idea…

From a Seed of an Idea…
To a spectacular service.
Our Shared Lives service is one of our biggest, with delivery in Scotland, Staffordshire, Wales and Merseyside. In case you haven’t come across this service, we offer family based placements for people with learning, physical and/or mental health needs. This works in a similar way to a foster placement but Shared Lives is specially designed for adults.
A couple of years ago Rita Lalley and Cath White from our Children and Families team came to the Innovation Committee to ask for funding to pilot a new version of this service. Since that time they’ve been piloting and have gone on to start formally delivering a new type of Shared Lives placement called ‘Transitions’. This approach is specialised for care leavers and young people aged under 25 who are not yet ready to live in Supported Living.
Currently we have four Shared Lives placements in Liverpool and the Wirral and a number of specialist carers who work exclusively with young people. Two of our carers in Liverpool, Karl and Joyce support three young people. One young man, Joe* is involved in our service user groups for Shared Lives Merseyside and also helps us regularly to interview for new Liverpool staff. Joe is now 23, has been with us since he was 20 years old. Since Joe has been placed with us he has attended college every year and has progressed to obtain a Level 1 Diploma (Distinction) in Land Based Studies. This year he has also been accepted on a BTEC Level 2 Diploma for ICT Practitioners at Liverpool Community College. Joe’s confidence has grown and grown and Karl describes how very slowly many of Joe’s ‘walls’ came down and how he is now a happy and optimistic young man, willing to take risks and meet the challenges that come his way.
Joe isn’t the only one making some great achievements in the Transitions service. We have another young person who arrived with us a year ago from a secure mental health unit due to paranoia, hallucinations, increased anxiety and agitation. He was also diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome and depression. Last year he enrolled at College near to his home in South Liverpool; he completed the year, achieving a Level 2 NVQ Award in Business and Administration. He’s just starting his courses this year in ICT and will be retaking his GCSE’s in Maths and English.
This service isn’t just changing the lives of young people like Jason, it is making them unrecognisable. Earlier this year a social worker for another young person in our Transitions service sent the following email to us to commend the service: ‘I went to visit Kai last week, what a difference in his mood! I can see positive changes already, Kai was very chatty and would initiate conversation. He was able to express positive compliments and would engage in small talk which is highly unusual for Kai. He is very, very, proud of his room and I got the impression that there is a very good rapport between Kai and Geoff, his carer. Kai talked positively about wishing to return to education and I am hoping that this week, Kai will seek Geoff’s support to explore available options and enrol to commence GCSE’s in September. I cannot emphasise enough how impressed I am with Kai’s progress and hope Geoff will continue to guide Kai in the right direction.’

Our Student Social Worker Programme



 
July 12, 2014
Rachael Stott
Our Student Social Worker Programme
A quick interview with Rose Devereux who heads up this programme.
How long have we been placing social work students in PSS?
We have a blue book in the People and Culture room that dates back to 1990, however Nicki Blundell who was in the role prior to me believes PSS have been offering placements since the 1970’s.
Which universities do we work with?
We have a partnership with Liverpool Hope University; part of the arrangement is that every student should have at least 1 placement at PSS during their time on the degree. PSS gives Hope University priority for placements over other universities.
We have also built links with Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool Community College, University of Lancashire (UCLAN), University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University, Sheffield Hallam University, University of Sheffield, Edge Hill University and Staffordshire University.
What are the benefits to the students themselves?
Placements create opportunities for learning and practicing social work knowledge and skills, ensuring that students meet the standards for professional conduct in practice.
It is not possible for students to become practitioners through writing and University based assessments alone. Practice requires complex skills, involving assessment, analysis, decision making and professional judgement. These skills can be supported by reading and discussions, but we can only identify what students have really learnt when they are assessed in real life situations.
Placements give students the opportunity to:

Meet the standards of professional practice. Under the General Social Care Council (GSCC) Code of Practice, students must learn to protect the rights and promote the interests and independence of service users and carers while, as far as possible, protecting them from danger or harm. They must also learn to maintain the trust and confidence of the public and those who use social care services, be accountable for the quality of their work and take responsibility for improving their knowledge and skills. (The GSCC is no longer the governing body for social workers, however, the new governing body The Health and Care Professional Council (HCPC) does not have a set code of practice and therefore Hope University continues to use the GSCC codes of practice as a guide.
Develop a range of knowledge, skills and practice qualities. Placements enable students to work with individuals, families, carers, groups and communities.
Work in multi-agency environments.

Placements give students the opportunity to interact with other professionals and learn more about how to work effectively in a multi-agency environment. It’s one thing to hear in university about what health visitors, police officers or community mental health nurses do, but quite another to work together to support a service user. Through their placements, students will get to know what everyday practice is really like and will be able to make informed career decisions. Students often change their career options when they discover new interests and abilities.
What are the benefits of placing a social work student to the service?
I think it’s much better if the answer to this question comes from the service itself so I’ve asked Family Impact to give us their perspective.
The benefits to the service of having a student on placement are that they provide additional help in the group activities and sessions. They provide new ideas for activities and help with daily tasks including phone calls and researching information needed. They spend time networking with other services resulting in referrals being made to other agencies. Students also bring a new perspective on work with children, young people and their families. Students have taken on lead roles in areas of the projects that have been specifically identified as needing support. A further benefit for the service is that students have applied for positions within the team when they have arisen and in some cases been successful in gaining employment.
What should students and employers gain from placements?
Placements are a three-way partnership between the student, the organisation, and the University. Practice assessors and supervisors supervise and mentor students and in doing so they are contributing to their own professional development.
University tutors have on-going relationships with placement providers at PSS and can feed in new learning through placement visits, information sharing and training days. Furthermore, the partnership with Hope has enabled projects such as Impact to write a bid for research in to the work we are doing in Sheffield.
PSS also has the chance to get to know students and consider their potential as future employees. Service users can often benefit from an organisation that provides placements because their student social worker will have smaller caseloads and more time to dedicate to learning new ways of working. Service users’ involvement, is also key to working in partnership, for example young people were included on an interview panel at Sheffield Springs. All potential social work students are interviewed by service users and they play a large part on the degree programme.
How many students do we place each year?
The average student intake prior to me taking on the role was 15 to 20 students per year. I’m proud to say we’ve now doubled that with the number of students being placed from April 2012 to April 2013 being 42.
What months do they start and how long do their placements last?
Students are placed throughout the year depending on the individual University. Placements range from 20 days to 100 days. We also work with students from other disciplines to include nursing, and psychology (not for payment).
I was mostly involved with the prisoners’ children side of the team, which was both fascinating and daunting at the same time. I had never really had any experience with anything prison-related, but I was with the team to learn, so got stuck in as soon as I could. Going from the classroom to the workplace was a nerve-wracking shift, and although I had worked in the past, I had never done anything like this before. As the months went by, I became more confident in working with the service-users and really started to enjoy being able to put my new found knowledge to good use!

Smarthouse Attracts Celebrity
When news reading and television star Angela Rippon stopped by at the Museum of Liverpool back in March, the Mi team seized the opportunity to show her the amazing Smart House facilities on display there.
Members of the Mi team were keen to tell her about the voice prompt and door contact system – a movement activated audio device that plays a reminders into the house just as you’re about to leave – and the high-tech Epilepsy sensor rug – a mat that knows when you’re having a seizure and notifies the houses life line box, and in turn emergency services.

We Can Do It
Last Friday saw the families and supporters of the Women’s Turnaround group gathered at the Isis Centre in Kirkdale to celebrate the success of the Education program they run with Manchester College.
Brookside and Shameless actress Tina Malone also stopped by to talk about her own achievements, and to reinforce the message that anything is possible, and inspire them to ‘keep dreaming, learning and achieving’. The room erupted into applause as Tina talked about overcoming her battles with alcohol, an issue that resonated with many in the audience.
Service Manager Sharon Cooper kicked off proceedings and described the scheme as ‘enabling and supporting women with tools to change their lives’, and after listening to the so many remarkable stories from the women who use the centre, it was clear that the team achieve that and more. Lead probation worker Nikki Sofia added: ‘We want probation to feel like an opportunity. Here at Women’s Turnaround, it might start off as a sentence but we really want the women to have a sense of ownership.
We offer a safe space for everyone, from the women themselves right down to their partners and families, and now we can offer qualifications with accreditation too.’
The courses have been running since April and are run by Mark Soady, of The Manchester College, which provides a comprehensive package of services for learners in custody and the community, enabling progression into education, training and employment.
Mark, who has adopted a flexible approach, in which he tailors courses to meet the women’s needs, says he is overwhelmed by the response from the women. “It is unbelievable and is probably the most rewarding work I have ever done,” he said.

A Banquet Fit for a King
Peter lives in Anfield and is part of our Liverpool Supported Living Project. In May it was his 50th birthday, and everyone from his home, including support workers and his housemates decided that we would try to make it an extra special celebration for him.
Peter loves socialising and dancing, and enjoys going out for meals, especially Chinese food. All the staff agreed that we should get Peter a ‘big posh taxi’ to take him to Chinatown for a nice meal; and so that’s exactly what we did – and here are the pictures to prove it!

Measuring Our Impact



 
July 1, 2014
Rachael Stott
Measuring Our Impact
Across the UK the Comprehensive Spending Review is making a big impact, not just on the lives of individuals but on organisations like ours. There just isn’t the money there once was and organisations are having to show that the work they do is having the desired impact.
Methodologies such as ‘Impact Reporting’ or ‘Social Return on Investment’ (SROI) are helping many organisations show that the work they are doing is having a positive impact, helping them to get ahead of the game by showing commissioners why their service is important. For this reason, we’ve started to look at our approach with a specialist consultant. Over the coming months she will be working with Lena O’Donnell from our Mi Team, Debbie Wright, Head of Service: Home and Communities for Merseyside, Viv Graham from Liverpool Health Trainer Service and Rachael Stott, Head of Communications. Together they will be working with Julie Rawlinson, Service Manager for our Post-natal Depression Service, going through the process of developing an Impact Assessment system that works for PND.
The ultimate aim of this piece of work will be to develop a toolkit that can be utilised across PSS to start looking at how we measure our impact in every service. Of course, we’re still in the early days and just looking at PND at this time, but, interestingly we are finding that we have a series of ultimate outcomes for that service that will be applicable to other services across PSS, including improved mental wellbeing and an increase in independence and employablity potential.
If we can get these systems right and integrated into individual services in appropriate ways, we’ll have a strong tool up our sleeve to show a range of stakeholders (including our commissioners and other service purchasers) that what we’re doing works.
We want a system that ultimately reduces our teams’ workloads by making it easier to monitor and fine tune our services, so that each person that uses them receives the maximum value they can.
“By knowing more about the impact we’re having we can make a bigger difference. We can be very clear about what we want to achieve and collect information to make sure it’s actually working. Where it is we can share this, and where it isn’t, we can learn from it.”
Lesley Dixon, CEO

National PND Alliance Launch



 
June 27, 2014
Rachael Stott
National PND Alliance Launch
The Perinatal mental Health national alliance are holding their next meeting at our Seel street offices on the 1st July from 10am – 4:30pm.
Pauline McPartland, Our PND Team leader who is hosting this event and our key representative in this alliance, says the cause has really caught peoples attention:
“Our first meeting was just twelve people, four of whom worked at the bluebell centre in Bristol, but this time we’ve got people coming from all over the place.
“The issue has really picked up momentum and we’ve got psychiatrists, GP’s, Celebrities, authors, organisations and perinatal people from Wales, Scotland, Ireland, even as far as Outer Hebrides attending!”
Speaking to survivors like Eve Cavanan, reading Jen Faulkner’s book that shows PND from a child’s perspective and who identified there was no national collective light being shined in this condition and meeting Ruth Jackson (founder of Bluebell Perinatal service in Bristol) made us all realise just how important it was to start raising the profile of this issue further, so we’re delighted that the cause has captured so much attention already, our vision is  it will go from strength to strength!
Our aim is to raise awareness, educate and to ultimately create a national perinatal awareness month. We all do incredibly positive and successful work individually, and we believe that together we are stronger. We have already started to development  an App too, it’s very exciting and we look forward to telling everyone about it in July!’

Barnsley’s 200 Mile Mission



 
June 21, 2014
Rachael Stott
Barnsley’s 200 Mile Mission
Last week saw our chief executive Lesley Dixon get on her bike to support the Barnsley Health trainers as they set off for a 200 mile bike ride.
Lesley rode alongside the men, from Barnsley Men’s Health Group, for the first leg of their journey along the Trans Pennine Trail from Liverpool to Hornsea.
The ride got started at Liverpool’s Albert Dock, and the sun was out as the team set off on their mission to raise awareness of men’s health and generate funds to refurbish the free community gym based at Shaw Lane in Barnsley.
The 25 cyclists undergoing the four-day challenge included retired men, partially-sighted men and ex-offenders, as well as those who have suffered from conditions including heart disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The cycling bug was sparked when the project successfully bid for £10,000 Big Lottery funding which enabled mountain bikes to be purchased.
Lesley said:
“It was brilliant to join the men at the starting point of the ride which I’m confident will prove very successful. We are delighted with the success of the Barnsley Men’s Health Group, which not only encourages a healthier lifestyle, but also promotes social wellbeing.
“Cycling is becoming a real passion within PSS and will hopefully lead to us all becoming a very healthy social enterprise.”

Our Health Trainer’s Top Tips



 
June 20, 2014
Rachael Stott
Our Health Trainer’s Top Tips
How many of us eat our five a day consistently? It can be quite a task, and we often get fed up of eating the same fruits!
Fruit contains many important vitamins and minerals that help us prevent a number of serious illnesses. Different fruits bring different benefits, so it is important to have a variation in our diet.
Another advantage of eating fruit is that the majority of fruit and vegetables contain no/little unhealthy fats and are low in calories. Why do we struggle to eating something that’s so tasty, juicy and good for us? We often get into unhealthy habits that are difficult to break; so how can we start implementing more fruit into our diet without it being a chore?
Set yourself a goal to eat at least one additional portion of fruit every day and start to feel the benefits! How about trying one today? All you need is a glass of apple juice, a handful of berries/strawberries (whichever you prefer) and lots of ice. Pop them all in the blender and whiz until the ice is broken.
Share and enjoy!

Mindfulfilled



 
June 11, 2014
Rachael Stott
Mindfulfilled
Back in February of 2013 the PSS Leadership Team took a rather unconventional proposal to our Board. As part of the new Management and Leadership Development Programme (MLDP) they wanted to take around forty senior managers through a programme in ‘Mindfulness’. Now, you might be thinking, ‘what’s that all about?’ or you might have heard the many positive views of those across PSS who were lucky enough to take part. Whatever you know or don’t know about Mindfulness, we want to give you a little bit of an overview.
So, what is Mindfulness?
Mindfulness is about being aware of our mental and emotional processes and managing them to become more fully present, ‘unhindered by habits and attitudes from the past and anxieties about the future’. When we are mindful we are able to observe our thoughts in an objective and non-judgmental way. Mindfulness meditation is a process for accomplishing that goal; it helps us relax and be in the moment. The result is clarity of our own awareness, and attitudes and this can then be used to check and modify destructive thoughts and feelings.
What did we do?
Each of our service managers and senior managers went through a programme of eight, half-day sessions and a two-day residential. During the programme we looked at emotional intelligence, self-awareness and understanding of different styles of management and leadership, all framed within a structure of meditation throughout the sessions.
What was the feedback?
The feedback has been unbelievable. In spite of some expected doubts at the start, every person walked away feeling the benefit. Some people described it as the most most useful personal development work they’d ever done.
Who delivered the course? Our Mindfulness facilitator Ondy Wilson has become something of a celebrity across PSS. With a background in training and education, she was described by our team as having an unbelievable skill in helping our team relate to the principles of Mindfulness.
This course has changed my life and will change the lives of so many people in my life! Having the opportunity to do this course is the greatest gift I have ever been given.

Annie’s New Direction



 
June 1, 2014
Rachael Stott
Annie’s New Direction
Its nearly 13 years ago that arriving brand new to PSS I joined the Shared Lives (or as it was then Adult Placement) family. I was struck immediately by the uniqueness and wow factor of the service. And so I started my journey from Adult Placement to Shared Lives and beyond.
Back then there was a core of carers based in Merseyside who had been providing a supportive family setting for vulnerable people for nearly 20 years at PSS. Adult Placement was very much a best kept secret but slowly over time news got out and the family expanded.
Firstly in 2002 Wirral carers joined the PSS Shared Lives family, a process that I was very much part of and so happy to meet the carers who were all extraordinary people living extraordinary lives.
Next came Wales, I had the great pleasure again of being part of the process to establish the service, meeting many amazing carers doing an amazing job. Not content with England and Wales, Scotland followed close behind with a base in Kirkintilloch, Glasgow.
Over the years I regularly visited Kirkintilloch attending carers meetings and have being awe inspired by the work of the carers providing family placements for adults of all ages and experience.
The Shared Lives family expanded again when Staffordshire joined PSS. Again I had the great opportunity of being there at the beginning, supporting carers and service users in the transfer to PSS welcoming them as part of the family. Very recently Wolverhampton has also come on board.
The range of people supported in the Shared Lives family has also expanded: people with learning disabilities, older people, people with mental health needs, complex physical and sensory disabilities, mums and babies, young people leaving care and people caught up in the criminal justice system. I don’t want to mention any carers by name because in my opinion you all deserve accolades for the difference you have made to hundreds of peoples lives.
So now nearly 13 years later there are 400+ carers at PSS who are all doing what it says on the tin – sharing their lives with others!
Elements of my role have changed through the years from the early days of carer recruitment and development, management of panel, supporting transfers, supporting carers with learning and development and carers meetings to my most recent specialist and advisory role. I’ve never had a moment to spare or a moment of boredom as a member of the Shared Lives family, always mindful that without the carers and service users none of this would have been possible.
So after 13 years the time has come for me to pack my bags and take a new direction. I’d be lying if I didn’t say it’s been a wrench but I’m taking all my amazing experiences with me. I will be working with the PSS Wellbeing Centres from 28th July and I feel excited at the opportunity for a new and different challenge. So as I reflect and look back as I empty my filing cabinet, I also look forward knowing that I have the full support of the PSS family behind me.
I’ve never had a momentto spare or a moment of boredom as a member of the shared lives family.

PSS’ New Directors



 
May 15, 2014
Rachael Stott
PSS’ New Directors
Rachael Stott: Director of Business Development and Innovation
I’m hugely excited to take on this new role and help to change our approach to growth and sustainability. Having a Directorate for Business Development and Innovation really helps us to show our commitment to our vision but also helps us become more ambitious and ultimately impact more lives. Working closely with Chris will mean we know more about what the people who use (or have potential to use) our services want from them. We’ll therefore have a much stronger process for making this happen by modernising and adapting what we currently do with the support of Pam Stopforth and ensuring that we get across to those people buying our services what makes us different and why they should choose PSS.
In the jobs I had before PSS I was focused on Business Development as well as communications and I must say although I love communications I have missed getting out there and meeting commissioners and seeing where there are opportunities for us. We want to know what’s got the best reviews, what meets our needs (sometimes those we didn’t even know we had) and which is going to be the most cost effective in terms of getting us the outcome we want. If we know what people want and focus our energies on making our services meet these needs in a cost effective way we’ll not need to sell them, they’ll sell themselves.
How is it different to what you used to do?
My previous role was really focused around the Communications side of what we do, the telling people who we are and why we’re great. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed working with everyone over the last couple of years completing the rebrand and improving how we communicate internally and externally but one gap for me has always been around focusing our messages. We do so many different things that trying to promote 25 plus services across the UK on an ongoing basis is not only confusing to the person receiving our messages but also more or less impossible!
In my new role I’ll be doing a wider ‘marketing’ job which (and I love to challenge this preconception!) doesn’t mean just advertising but finding out what people want, working with Ops to make this happen and then promoting the end result to those who need it. Of course communications is still central, we’ve got to get the message of how great we are across still, but all the stuff that comes before that will be fine-tuned to ensure clarity and focus.
How will this affect/change PSS?
One thing that’s always challenged me is that although we are amazing at so many things our offer is really difficult to describe. What we need to do now is say to the marketplace ‘we’re not a specialist in mental health or learning disabilities or supported living or troubled families we’re a specialist because we’re not a specialist’. So what the heck do I mean by that? Well we’re different because we can meet a single person’s needs in many different ways. Key to that is cross-service working so that we’re all working together to add value.
Lots of this has been going on and it’s amazing, we just need to formalise it more in terms of what we’re directly offering to commissioners and the people who are using our services so that they go ‘wow they really have thought of everything’. New models around integrated social care and health commissioning mean this is a great time to develop this focus; hopefully it’ll really help us stand out.
Ultimately we need to become more enterprising to go out there and (like organisations who are truly commercial) find the gap and we find a way to help.
CHRIS BARKER: Director of Services
Tell us about your new role?
I’m really thrilled to be in the role of Director of Services, which is a new post that has been introduced following our Fit for the Future restructure. Now we’ve created our new directorate of Business Development and Innovation it means that in the Operations directorate we can focus on making sure that our teams are well supported to deliver high quality services and positive outcomes for the people who use them. In my new role I have overall responsibility for the successful delivery of all our UK services. It’s a challenge I’m well up for – and I’m lucky in having a fantastic operational management team around me and committed front line staff throughout PSS.
How is it different to what you used to do?
I’ve been with PSS for two years as Head of Operations (England) and have deputised for Paul Harris, our previous Director of Operations. So in some ways my new role feels very familiar. However, I’ve joined the Leadership Team, which is a big change, and I’m really enjoying working with Lesley and the team at a time when we have so many opportunities and challenges ahead of us.
The major difference is that my focus can now be on making sure we continue to deliver services that are excellent and great value for money. In my previous role I was also involved in the business development side of things and I wasn’t able to get out and about to visit services as much as I wanted to. This is really going to change and in the coming weeks and months I’ll be spending time with services across Scotland, England and Wales.
I want to meet and get to know staff teams and our Shared Lives Carers to fully understand how their services work, what their jobs are like and what their issues and concerns may be.
How will this affect/change PSS?
A key reason for creating the new directorate was to help us put the right amount of time and energy into delivering high quality services whilst achieving our ambitions to innovate and grow. With Rachael Stott heading up the new directorate, and me leading on operational matters, we have much more capacity to position PSS so that we can sustain our current services and win new contracts. Rachael and I are working closely together and she’s already supporting our Heads of Service and Service Managers with activity linked to business development and innovation.
I can honestly say that, although we are only a few weeks into our new ways of working, we’re already seeing how much more we can achieve with a more focused approach. All the changes we’ve been going through have been very hard but I firmly believe that we’re going to emerge stronger. This will ultimately be for the benefit of all the people who use PSS services.

Relaunch of the Meadows



 
May 8, 2014
Rachael Stott
Relaunch of the Meadows
The Meadows, our facility in Scotland that offers short breaks and crucial relaxation time for families and service users, recently underwent a bit of a make-over.
April 23rd saw the unveiling of the centres new look, with Chief Exec Leslie Dixon making the trip up to Scotland to meet the new Meadows team and the people who use the facility. Food and refreshments were available as well as activities and workshops for those who use the service and their families to test out the new space.
Team Leader Cheryl Blair tells us:
We really needed a bit of modernisation, and everyone is loving the changes. we’ve redecorated every room and even turned the dining room into a chill out room with sensory lights and equipment and beanbags. It means we can use the space for music therapy and other activities. It’s much more versatile

A Day in the Life of Michelle Corrigan
06:30
Who needs an alarm clock when you have a cat! Once he’s pried off my pillow and fed it’s time to take my dog for a walk in the beautiful local park. Trying really hard to focus on playing fetch and appreciate the nice weather whilst mentally listing all of the things I need to get done today.
08:45
Arrive in the office and check who I’m due to meet. Quick catch up with Rita, Head of service for Strengthening Families, to see if we have heard from any bids and then I check out today’s tender opportunities and see a brilliant one for a service similar to Women’s Turnaround in Wales.
10:30
Meeting at Barnardos with Lorna from the Impact team. We are meeting a group of funders interested in projects that support young people affected by family members in prison. We get very excited and start planning our proposal as we head back to Seel Street.
12:30
Lunch time, but no break for me today. As a city councillor I have a stack of case work for residents in my ward. Since it is sunny I head over to the Bluecoat garden and start making my phone calls whilst I grab a sandwich.
13:00
We are submitting a proposal to expand our Aspire service into new schools. I spend a couple of hours mapping out what we need to write a really brilliant proposal and who the best people are to involve in making that happen.
16:15
Bump into Rita whilst fighting with the photocopier and she tells me we have been shortlisted for a pot of money for the Women’s Turnaround. There is a focus on digital inclusion so I dash round to the Mi team where I used to work to ask for some advice.
17:00
After work it is straight to a meeting for my councillor role. I call my sister on the way, she also works for PSS, and ask her to check in on my pets. The meeting is a really important debate with local residents about the future of local sports and library services in the midst of the cuts.
20:30
Well after a very heated meeting and lots of new ideas to consider it is finally time to head home.

Diabetes Month



 
April 25, 2014
Rachael Stott
Diabetes Month
In the UK, diabetes affects approximately 2.9 million people. There are also thought to be around 850,000 people with undiagnosed diabetes. The two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.
So what are the symptoms?
The main symptoms of diabetes are:

feeling very thirsty
urinating frequently, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk

Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly, over weeks or even days. Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because early symptoms tend to be general.
What causes diabetes?
The amount of sugar in the blood is usually controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).  When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it is broken down to produce energy. However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there is either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced does not work properly.
How can you reduce your risk of diabetes?
Move more – that’s the simple advice! Risk of diabetes is strongly like to being overweight, by being more active you can help yourself to reduce your weight and improve your health. Ask your GP practice to get you an appointment with a Health Trainer who can help support you to make a start.
Are you between 40 and 74 years of age? Do you know if you are at risk of diabetes?
A free NHS Health Check is offered to all those people in your age group and can work out your risk of developing diabetes. To make an appointment for a health check please ring your GP practice.
What should YOU do when you are told you are at risk or if you have diabetes already?
The most important thing you can do is to attend your appointments where you will get all the advice, support and check-ups you need so that you can start to make positive changes for your health.

Finding Future Talent



 
April 11, 2014
Rachael Stott
Finding Future Talent
Deciding if someone has what it takes to become a social worker can be tricky for even the most seasoned interviewers, but in their most recent batch of interviews for the BA and MA social worker course, staff in the Social work, Care and Justice department Hope University have had the unique insight of carers as well as current and ex service users to help them make their decision.
The participants work with lecturers, social care professional and academics to design the questions for interview, assess presentation and interview performance. Members of the group Fran and Sharon say: “our involvement is all about mending the gap between parents and professionals, and helping to two understand each other more”
Participants in the scheme have often used services throughout their lives and, having worked with numerous social workers along the way, they know exactly what to look for. Frances, who been through the care system herself has a very clear idea about what qualities will make someone a great social worker. ‘The good ones are those who are willing to learn and listen, and let others talk rather than always dominating the discussion. They need to not be scared to talk about their personal experience too, so that’s something I like seeing during the interviews.’
In May, participants attended a two day conference in Durham, where the focus was on the Mental Health Charter. Attendees who had experienced mental health care presented their stories and experience, and worked with professionals and academics to workshop innovations and solutions. For participant June, the trip was incredibly rewarding ‘Durham was a marvellous experience. I didn’t get my 11 plus or anything so it’s nice to work alongside all these professors. Now I feel like I’m giving something back’
After sitting in on interviews and contributing to the feedback Sharon, who went through care proceedings while suffering from Post natal depression, now feels confident enough to lead the interview: ‘It’s something I wouldn’t have been able to do a few years ago. I’m quite shy but this has really brought me out of myself.’
This remarkable group also help with the interview process for Academic staff in the department, and team leader Rose Dereveux hopes that the scheme will continue to grow ‘It’s quite unique really, and the group have become an integral part of Hope and PSS. They’re helping to challenge preconceptions about service users and carers and they’re giving us an insight we really couldn’t get anywhere else.’

Shared Lives Wales Update



 
April 3, 2014
Rachael Stott
Shared Lives Wales Update
Emma Maylor-Davies from Shared Lives North Wales discusses how her team get Service users involved in the Selection process at their May meeting.
“Recently in Wales we have had an influx of applications from people wanting to become Shared Lives Carers. The Shared Lives Team and Service Users have spent a lot of time bringing Carers through the recruitment process. Because of this during the May Service User Meeting we looked at the questions they would like to ask prospective carers.
We used a picture of a house as a basis for the discussion and we all either wrote or drew a picture of what we thought was most important to us in our homes. We also looked at the current questions and discussed them as a group to see if we needed to alter them at all.
When we came together as a group several main themes came through as to what was most important to us all: having someone there to support them and to give them advice; knowing that the carer was qualified to care for them and that they had been DBS checked; knowing their friends and family could come and see them; if the carer had any pets and that the carer would support them to do things they enjoy and want to achieve.
We had a great discussion and several Service Users volunteered to take part in the assessment process. Team Wales are now also lucky enough to have our very own Shared Lives Street made up of our drawings on the wall!”

The Birdman of Altcourse

The Birdman of Altcourse
Dominic works for us at at the Visitors Centre at HMP Altcourse as a Visitor Support Worker. A few months ago, as part of his Development Plan, Dominic proposed that we should redevelop the garden next to the Centre as an interactive wildlife area.
His plan was to attract birds and other animals by providing feeders and to produce information and interactive activities particularly for children who visit, to educate them about nature. The added benefit of this is, of course, ensuring the children are kept busy and ultimately feel less anxious about visiting the prison. The team thought it was a great idea and got moving with the project. It has been up and running for nearly a year now and is something Dominic and the team should be very proud of.

Nuala’s Time at PSS

Nuala’s Time at PSS
Hello! My name is Nuala and I am a student social worker doing my placement with the Enable Project. I just wanted to express my gratitude for the experience the project has given me and also for the support and knowledge I have gained from the PSS family.
These past few weeks have been the most inspiring, eye-opening and motivating I have experienced! I first started out with the idea that I was going to make this huge life changing experience in someone’s life, but reality soon sank in. In today’s society, there are a lot of barriers which stop people from achieving their aims and goals, but with projects like Enable everything is possible and achievable! With the people I have had the privilege of working with in the project I have grew stronger as a person and cannot wait to get into the world of social work.
The values of the PSS service strive for excellence in everything they do along with continuously looking for new ways to improve.
One of the things I loved the most about the PSS and Enable project is how they strive for person centred practice. It was inspiring to see that every individual in the service aimed to have the service users at the heart of their support.
As a student social worker we are continually reminded how the person requiring our help is our main priority, but to witness it in practice has made it all make sense.
So I leave with positive thoughts and a wonderful experience! I have been guided and supported by 6 incredible angels and I cannot thank them enough! Anna, Siobhan, Anne, Marie, Tessa and Patty thank you!
Happy 20th Anniversary to Enable and I can only hope there’s 2000 more!
Love and Kindness Nuala
It was inspiring to seethat every individual in the service aim to have the service users at the heart of their support.

Dementia Day in Barnsley



 
February 11, 2014
Rachael Stott
Dementia Day in Barnsley
Two of our Health Trainers, Kelly and Julie, run a chair-based exercise group at Mapplewell Manor in Barnsley. Mapplewell is a care home that has a dementia ward attached to it.
Ben Towler, one of our Senior Health Trainers and Your Forum members, found out about the rempods the Mi team are using in Liverpool to help people start conversations around times gone by and he mentioned to the coordinator at the home that PSS had these tools and they discussed how wonderful it’d be to use them in Barnsley.
So, very pro-actively, Ben went off and spoke to the Mi team and asked if they could borrow them for a few days, and of course the Mi team were very helpful. Some of the Mi team went across to Barnsley too to share their expertise. All the participants were given a seat in the ‘pub rempod’ and they spent the morning talking over old times and having a lovely time. Whilst there, dementia awareness taster training was given to staff working at the home by the PSS team. Well done to all involved for a great example of cross-service working which has given people using our services a day to remember.

From Sweden to Seel Street



 
February 4, 2014
Rachael Stott
From Sweden to Seel Street
My name is Hanna Roslund. I am a Swedish social work student at Malmo University. For the next 20 weeks I am having my placement here at PSS. A while back I decided that it was time for something new in my life…
So one afternoon I looked through Hope University’s homepage and came across PSS. A few e-mails later that “something new in my life” turned out to be PSS and Mi team in Liverpool. I was really excited and happy to start my placement.
Of course there were times I felt nervous, scared and started to panic about leaving my security back home in Sweden because I did not know what was awaiting me at PSS, or in Liverpool for that matter.
Since day one the people at pss have made me feel included and I really admire the creativity that lives within this organisation.
Well, I have to say that I have not once felt scared or nervous since starting my placement. The welcome at PSS has been absolutely fantastic, I could not ask for anything else. From being collected at the airport, to meeting the other students on placement to being introduced to the Mi team, it has through and through been a really good week. Everywhere I go is a friendly face. Everybody is really keen on me getting on well with my placement as well as getting to know the city and its surroundings.
During my first week I have taken part in some training and some lectures. I have also been given the opportunity to talk with the people on Mi team about their different projects. One of the things I appreciate with PSS is that everybody speaks about their projects with such warmth and enjoyment.
So if one is supposed to leave all security back in Sweden; PSS is a really good place to leave it for. I am positive that my 20 weeks here will give me invaluable knowledge.
Since day one the people at pss have made me feel included and I really admire the creativity that lives within this organisation.

Tommy’s Interesting Hobby

Tommy’s Interesting Hobby
Laura White from our Shared Lives Scotland service was visiting one of her long-term placements when Tommy, who uses the service, started telling her about his new hobby…
Tommy’s carer Keith has started up a Boccia group in Garelochhead, which if you haven’t heard of it is a sport similar to bowls, which is ideal for people with disabilities. Tommy attends the weekly class with around 20 other regular members.
By all accounts Tommy is pretty good at this and the competition is fierce! The group hopes to hold an away match sometime soon with another group from Fort William. This group is open to anyone regardless of ability, age and is not affiliated with any specific organisation or charity.

A Day in the Life of Kate Morgan

A Day in the Life of Kate Morgan
06:15
That pesky alarm sounds again. Why does the morning come around so quickly!? Anyway, time to get up and start the day, breakfast, feed the cat, quick catch up with my husband about the day’s plans (and more importantly, what we are eating for tea that night) and off we go!
08:30
Arrive in the office and pop the kettle on for the morning brew.
I check my emails, update my ‘To Do List’ for the day and continue with my paperwork for a new transitional placement that is soon to be presented at panel.
09:00
My ‘admin’ time is stop and start while I take calls from Shared Lives carers and follow up on actions by chasing social workers and updating files. I enjoy chatting with carers and love hearing about their plans and how people thrive whilst living with a Shared Lives Carer.
10:00
Time for a sit down and catch up with our new social work student who I am currently acting as work based supervisor for. We chat about the tasks she has done over the past week and reflect on what she has learned so far. We work together to make a plan for the forthcoming week and identify areas that would benefit her learning.
12:30
Our weekly matching meeting takes place in the office, so the team gather round and update each other on the progress of new referrals and status of current ‘matches’. We have 4 referrals to go and meet following this weeks matching meeting, and 2 successful matches which is always a positive feeling!
14:00
Head out for a bit a lunch and make my way to my afternoon visit.
15:00
Professionals meeting to discuss a new long term placement and to plan to ensure we are all ‘on the same page’ with regard to supporting this young adult to reach her full potential whilst in placement. This meeting was a good opportunity to meet some of the other agencies involved in this placement and develop my network links for the future.
16:45
Finish meeting, check my mobile phone and emails for any messages while I have been out of the office. Time for the long journey home again, when I plan to put my feet up and continue ‘Breaking Bad’ fourth season (no spoilers please, as we still have many episodes to watch!).

Party Time at the Fusion

Rachael Stott
Party Time at the Fusion
For those of you who aren’t familiar with it, the Fusion Centre is in Birkenhead in the Wirral and supports people aged over 55 who have additional needs such as disabilities or dementia.
The team there help people to stay engaged with their community and reduce social isolation. Unfortunately, the service had a rather challenging pre-Christmas period last year; they had a serious gas leak over the two days that their Christmas party was meant to happen. Therefore, a serious rethink had to be done so that the team didn’t have to totally cancel the whole event. But the shining armour came out and the tenants in one of our other Wirral based services (the sheltered housing scheme) came to the rescue.
An Elfing hand at Vincent Naughton Court: and (with a little more time on hand in this instance) their chef was able to cook the Christmas dinner.
Again, all the tenants helped to make the day special but in particular one of the tenants, Doreen William, dressed as a little elf and helped serve lunches and give Christmas pressies out, making it a day to remember. What a lovely example of different services, teams and people using our services, helping each other out at times of crisis and making Christmas really special for others.
Christmas Spirit at Rose Court: The tenants at Rose Court kindly let the Fusion Centre use their communal lounge to hold their dinner and party and a local pub prepared the Christmas dinners required for take out.
The tenants all helped collect the meals, serve them and made the day very special for the Fusion Centre service users.

A Day of Creativity at the Avenue



 
January 12, 2014

A Day of Creativity at the Avenue
Our Avenue service is one of several centres that offers support to people struggling with mental health issues in Liverpool. The Avenue’s Singing and Creative Writing group recently performed at the centre’s birthday celebration during October.
The singing performance was about 10 minutes long and afterwards the group read a poem they had written with creative writing facilitator Tracy Aston about the service. We’ve shared this really lovely tribute to the team and service below.
The Avenue
Without you there’s no reason to get to my feet,
within you, together, we smile as we greet,
no need to hide our own private grief,
we’re all on a journey to re-build self-belief.
Without you, we’d feel completely alone,
no listening ear at the end of the phone.
Within you I’m starting to find the old me,
getting out and about with new places to see.
Now the fog lifts and with it, despair,
a glimmer of sun makes things easier to bear.
Life’s cruel game becomes a thing of the past,
having given us so much we hope The Avenue will last.

Robot Builders R Us

Robot Builders R Us
The Robots project was designed to engage with people across PSS to encourage them to think about how technology could improve people’s safety and independence. The first challenge was to complete some draft drawings of robots and make a record of what actions their robot could perform. Teams received packs that included a sketchbook, a DVD of instructions and a design record to fill in about each design.
We received 12 entries from across the country including Scotland, Liverpool and Staffordshire and we tasked a panel of Brainiaks (Julia Purvis, Christine Barker & Karol Zwolinski) to assess the designs and invite those chosen to the second stage of the competition. For stage two we teamed up with the Bluecoat Display Centre and local artist Mike Badger to build the robots from recycled materials based on the original designs. Once the robots were built it was time to choose our overall winner and the panel took a long time in their deliberations. However, they struggled to choose between them and decided to award the ‘Supreme Robot Builder 2013’ title and £150 in assistive technology gift vouchers to:

Family Impact Team with the ‘Rocky Robot’
Wirral Shared Lives Team with the ‘Authenticon’
Enable Team the ‘Reading Robot’

The Robots are now displayed at the Museum of Liverpool in the Mi Smart House. Congratulation to all our winners and well done and thanks to all the

Mi on the Trail

Mi on the Trail
To celebrate exceeding our ‘Mi Champion’ recruitment target, the team invited people involved in the service and the wider PSS family to take part in a treasure trail around Liverpool City Centre. Participants were invited to the Liverpool Museum Mi Smart House, where individuals were welcomed with light refreshments and the announcement of the finalists in the PSS Robots competition.
Participants then got together in their teams and were given ‘trail packs’ including instructions and a t-shirt for group leaders and very importantly some energy boosting sweets. The teams had to follow clues on a walk around the city centre and ultimately this guided them to ‘The Brink’ café and restaurant. This was a surprise for all attendees and they were greeted with a hot buffet, refreshments and entertainment. The first team that completed the 3 mile trail did so in 55 minutes and they received some fantastic prizes. At the end of the event the winners of the Robot competition were announced and awarded. To find out who was successful see the below article!

NHS Graduate Fiona’s Time at PSS



 
December 27, 2013
Rachael Stott
NHS Graduate Fiona’s Time at PSS
Hello everyone. I work in HR for the NHS and have just finished my 8 week secondment to PSS and what a fantastic learning experience it’s been. I’d like to let you know about the work I was doing on development and career planning and what this means for you, as well as share my thoughts on my time with PSS.
I had the opportunity to go to any organisation but jumped at the chance to come to PSS because I wanted to know more about health and social care and see how support and care can be delivered differently than in the NHS.
My role was to develop proposals for how PSS can grow and nurture its people and what happens next for people identified as Rising Stars.
Firstly I looked outside PSS to see what other organisations were doing around development and career planning. I got useful real first hand accounts from them about what worked well and things we could learn from them.
Then I talked with people across PSS to hear about the great things already happening with development and career planning across the different services. I also heard about the different challenges you had and got your thoughts on some of the ideas we were beginning to shape around growing and nurturing the people of PSS.
Some of the key messages you told me were that there needs to be clarification about what it means to be a Rising Star and more support on identifying development opportunities to help you be the best you can be in your role or help you be prepared for future roles.
You told me that introducing career pathways and a career framework would also help with role and career development, and from a service point of view that they would help attract, develop and keep great people at PSS.
I pulled together all the research, feedback and recommendations for a final presentation and report for the Leadership Team and People and Culture Team and over the coming months Jackie Bailey, Organisation Development Manager will be taking the project forward so watch this space!
So how did I find life at PSS? From my first day I was made to feel like I belonged. But not only that, everyone I spoke to was so passionate about their jobs and about providing an excellent service to those they support.
I enjoyed learning about the range of services within PSS and really valued being able to go along to the Family Impact Nurturing session and the Enable Drama Group, it was a privilege and a rewarding experience to see first hand the great work done at PSS and the impact this has for the people you support.
My thinking has been broadened about how care and support can be delivered in a more people centred way. It’s been a rich learning experience that will make me better in my role within the NHS.
Lastly I’ve met some fantastic people along the way and it was certainly difficult to say goodbye. My next job is at Mersey Care NHS Trust so maybe I’ll cross paths with some of you again.
Best wishes,
Fiona
Fiona will be presenting the findings of her report to the NHS Leadership academy

Enable Get Dramatic

Enable Get Dramatic
Over 10 years ago the Enable team started the service’s drama group and from the outset it was very popular, putting on lots of public shows including a performance of Grease.
Sadly, the group didn’t last but now in 2013, the team have decided to go for it again! The new group has been meeting for 5 weeks now, every Tuesday 11am till 2pm.
The team thought it was really important to reintroduce the group because music and movement allows people who may find it difficult to express themselves to really thrive. Currently the group has 11 members who are all supported by the Enable team.
Over the last 5 weeks, the group have been working on communication, interaction, confidence building and how to create a character.
Some of our members have taken part in drama before but others are newcomers and the group is really starting to gel now which is great! As many of you may know, Enable will be 20 years old in 2014 and the drama group are hoping to celebrate this great event with a public show, so watch this space!
At the moment, all members of the group are female which isn’t a problem, but it would be great to have some men in the group to make it even more diverse.

A Day in the Life of Kim Worthington

A Day in the Life of Kim Worthington
07:30
Wide awake and met with a hundred questions from my very inquisitive 9 year old! Prepare our breakfast and lunch for the day and after my morning cup of tea off to do the school run before work.
08:50
School run completed, kisses in my car before she leaves me for the day as she’s “too cool” to kiss mum in front of her class mates.
09:20
Attend home visit and engage new client, and make arrangement to meet her in the centre next week. Positive outcome achieved and arrangements made also to ensure she has legal representation and the Women’s Turnaround Project supporting her at court.
10:30
Arrive back at centre to see the first of my 3 counselling clients, counselling initial assessment completed and a very vulnerable lady finally receives much needed support through our project.
11:30
3 way meeting with a new client with myself and her probation officer. Initial assessment completed and a tailored support plan created to meet the clients needs, client stays for breakfast club and meets our peer mentor and gets introduced to our dedicated team.
12:45
2nd counselling client of the day; makes my client one of my award winning cups of tea before we start our session.
13:00
Head out of office for a child protection conference.
14:30
Arrive back at the office and update paperwork, complete a few actions from the meeting and make a quick call to the client to check she understands what is happening next and what is expected of her after the conference.
15:00
Last counselling session completed for the day and a quick tidy round the centre.
16:00
Update case notes and file whilst checking my emails.
16:20
Cover the last hour of duty in the ISIS centre which consists of being a sole point of contact for the women assisting with phone calls, bus passes and any enquiries they may have and an excellent opportunity to engage with the women and check on their progress. Often a nice opportunity for the ladies to make you a nice cup of tea to show you their appreciation!
17:30
Another day in the office completed – reflect on my day feeling very priviledged to work with amazing women and to be part of such a special team as I wind down and leave to pick my daughter up from afterschool club, teatime followed by nice night with my favourite little 9 year old.
…feeling very priviledged to work with amazing women and to be part of such a special team

Our Values Award Winners 2013

Rachael Stott
Our Values Award Winners 2013
In the Summer edition of the Loop and through email requests and your team meetings we asked you to submit nominations for our Values Awards 2013. We wanted to know how you are living our values and asked you to tell us stories which related to any one of the six. During the recent roadshows we announced the winners and runners up but only on the occasions where the majority of the winning team were in attendance. Therefore, most of you won’t know who won and what the story behind their success was. So read on and find out what your colleagues and their teams did this year to make them worthy of a Values Awards trophy and certificate.
We’re brave enough to take risks
Winners: Shared Lives Merseyside
T was homeless when she was referred to Shared Lives Merseyside and was battling with drug and alcohol misuse. In her earlier days T had been in an extremely violent, abusive relationship and had sustained severe head injuries leaving her cognitively impaired, with short term memory loss and mobility problems. Her children had been taken into care and T had a very chaotic and erratic lifestyle moving from one place to another.
J worked in different roles within the Shared Lives Scheme for over 20 years and made the bold decision to become a Shared Lives carer because she thought the role would be “a good change” and she would find it “very rewarding”.
After a full assessment of T’s needs and as part of our matching process J and T were introduced and T said she would like to move in with J on a trial basis. The Scheme was taking a measured risk because T had not experienced family life and she had not been used to routine and stability.
J had not supported anyone in her home 24/7 before and it was a culture shock for them both. The first couple of months presented a series of challenges as adjustments were made. T wasn’t sleeping and J was beginning to realise the demands of supporting T in all aspects of her daily life. The team visited them both regularly and provided support and advice when issues arose.
Over time with the guidance and support of the team J gained T’s trust and she settled in very well. A routine has been established and T’s confidence has grown and she now takes pride in her appearance. She lives a healthy lifestyle free from drugs or alcohol and appreciates “the quietness in her life”.
J says that becoming a carer presented her with challenges she could not have anticipated and it has definitely been life changing but in a good way. T says that she likes the stability in her life and “she would be lost if she didn’t have J”.

We seek to understand needs and find a way to help
Winners: Family Impact
Family Impact work with what could be argued the most vulnerable children and their families: children affected by drug, alcohol misuse and parental imprisonment. As Seamus the Service’s Manager says, ‘the team are the eyes and ears for social workers to safeguard children and their families’. One member of the team Lorna is currently undertaking a PhD to enable her and the team to identify needs and find evidenced based practice to support children and their families and help to bring about change.
They have devised ‘letter box contact’ for children that social services have identified as too high risk to visit their parents; this work is underpinned by the knowledge that children need a ‘sense of identity to enable them to make sense of their world’. The staff identified the need for children to have an influential voice regarding information sharing within schools etc. The team have supported children to be keynote speakers at conferences to teach professionals what is like to have a parent in prison and have teachers and other professionals sharing information inappropriately. This training is called hidden sentence training.
The team identified the need for parents and carers to attend courses to promote their parenting skills to enable them to support children more effectively. The Nurturing Programme was chosen by the team as this programme also promotes the needs for parents to nurture themselves to enable them to help their children.
The team are proactive in service user engagement and regularly hold consultation events to enable children and their families to share their views this enables them to help shape the service.

We recognise potential
Winners: Liverpool Health Trainers
A client who felt at their lowest, struggling at home with children and housework felt they had nothing to look forward to or focus on. She became involved with the Health Trainer service and they encouraged her to access a walking group, then the walk leader course and then she independently set up her own walk.
From there the Health Trainer referred her to the ‘knowing yourself’ course and she began to have dreams and felt inspired to do more. She has now started up a project called the ‘parent hub’ allowing parents to access outreach projects such as Addaction, Citizen’s Advice, fitness and beauty treatments and an area for children to play. The client described the HT support as empowering and now believes ‘anything is possible’. She has gone on to win the Spirit of Merseyside ‘Cohesion award’ beating a host of other agencies in Liverpool and last year she won the individual ‘Unsung hero award’. The project has been so successful that it has been replicated in another local centre.

We get even better at what we do
Winners: People and Culture
Every year hundreds of PSS Supporters volunteer across the UK, helping us achieve our goals and change lives for the better. Recently we ran a series of recognition events with the clear message to all our Supporters across the country of “thank you, we couldn’t do it without you”
In line with the theme of National Volunteers week 2013, ‘thank you’ and ‘recognition”, the Business Partner Team (People & Culture) organised Supporter events which enabled us to share stories, celebrate the achievements of our Supporters and to thank them for their vital support. In celebrating their achievements, we also wanted to appreciate the growing potential of Supporters, in terms of how they support us. We also wanted to recognise individuals and groups who, through their performance, attitude, behaviour and actions, live the PSS values.
To achieve this, we thought it would be a nice idea to replicate the ‘Values Awards’ that were held for staff last year and subsequently asked for Supporter nominations from staff teams across the regions.
The many moving and inspiring stories we received, demonstrated enthusiasm and a real commitment to the work of Supporters. We were able to share these stories throughout the events run both in Merseyside during National Volunteer Week and more recently in Barnsley and Scotland. The events gave Supporters the opportunity to share their experiences with other Supporters and the wider PSS team. They also provided inspiration to those services still looking for ideas of how to engage Supporters, giving some real examples of roles that are carried out by Supporters. From these events, Supporters have been spreading the word that we’re a great place to volunteer; we’ve even had new Supporters wanting to get on board as a result! The overall feedback from the events has been excellent and Supporters have fed back that they feel valued and recognised for the volunteering they do with PSS. We recognised that due to other commitments, not all Supporters may be able to attend one of the three celebratory events; therefore we felt it was important that everyone received a personal thank you letter from Lesley.
In incorporating the ‘Values Awards’ , we have been able to make sure our values are ‘kept alive’ through our service teams, by not just thinking about what it is that supporters are doing, but just as importantly, thinking about ‘how’ they are carrying out their particular roles. Within our team, we are always striving to get better at what we do and these celebratory events, which were organised in a short amount of time with limited budget, have made significant inroads to recognising and thanking Supporters for their valued contributions.

We encourage independence and choice
Winners: Shared Lives Wirral
R was referred to the service a couple of years ago when he needed emergency respite but his placement quickly become long-term once everyone could see how much R was benefiting from his placement. R had previously lived at home with his mother and sister who constantly criticised and made fun of him, he was neglected, shy and really unhappy.
R’s social worker explained that R was riding around the community all day and half the night on his bike to keep himself away from the house but the local community had began to make complaints saying that he was causing trouble. All R’s benefits were paid to his mother and R never had any money of his own.
The team began by getting all his benefits in his own name and supporting R to open his own bank account. When R’s money began to come through it was magical to watch his amazement of having money and being able to spend it on what he wanted. R bought some new clothes; he had always wanted nice clothes as his clothing often brought him unwanted attention. R bought the one thing he had always wanted but never thought he would own which was an X-box and it still remains his pride and joy.
R’s carer and the scheme worked closely together to educate R around budgeting and saving and using money responsibly. Again R was amazed that if he saved, over time he could buy himself a television and a computer, he is now an avid saver and a great spender.
R grew from strength to strength, he ate properly and the team encouraged him around healthy eating. A year down the line and you would not recognise R as being the same person. When R came onto our service full time he told us his main interests were gardening (as he wants to grow things) and computers. This month R went for an interview for an IT course that he has applied for that is due to begin in September. After the interview the IT tutor told R that she was really impressed by his knowledge of computers and his commitment towards the course and R got a place. As time goes by R requires less and less support from the scheme as his confidence is growing more and more. R’s social worker believes that if R had been left with his family it would have been a matter of time before he would have been in trouble with the Police. The service prevented this and also gave R his dignity and respect back.

We earn people’s trust
Winners: Aspire
To develop our work in schools, the Aspire pilot in Yorkshire has had to earn the trust of many people including teaching staff and the community. Some members of the senior teaching team were very unsure as to how social workers from a charitable organisation could evidence positive outcomes for the children and the school. At a time when the school was in special measures and under scrutiny, the decision to try something new was a big one.
Social workers in the local area had not had good press and the teachers within the school felt that they did not understand the needs of the children and the difficulties the teachers experienced in striving to meet the student’s educational potential. Teachers within the school felt that at times social workers let the children down, didn’t attend meetings and that inclusion staff were left to manage children with specialist needs without specialist support. Staff within the school were also concerned as to PSS’ ability to recruit the right staff for the pilot as they wanted social workers with experience and passion to work in partnership with children, families, staff at the school and professionals from outside agencies.
We earned the trust of the school team by evidencing good practice; ensuring school students took an active role in the recruitment process and the fact that it took three recruitment drives before we recruited the right people for the pilot.
Staff had to gain the trust of the school’s management team and re-assure them that the work we would be doing would work alongside and back up pre-existing models of support. They are now one of PSS’ biggest allies and feel we have brought professionalism to the role of educational welfare in the school and feel supported in the difficult social care issues they face on a daily basis. The Head of Inclusion for the school now feels she can trust PSS social workers to take the lead on the weekly safeguarding meetings and she is also happy for PSS staff to take the lead on ‘Children In Need’ Meetings and ‘Team Around the Child’ meetings. The Educational Psychologist at the school is now working with the team and is gaining trust in our ability to evidence child centred support and assessments.
The children trust us to work with them and their families even though it took a while for them to get used to our Liverpool accents (the children struggled to understand us and kept telling us to speak slower!). The children tell us that we make them believe in themselves and we have helped them to identify their aspirations and goals and they now feel that they can achieve in education. We have earned the trust of families and they are now beginning to value our support rather than feeling threatened by us visiting the family home, we have helped families to gain more appropriate housing and mediated in family disputes to gain better outcomes for the children.

Our Newest Friends



 
December 5, 2013
Rachael Stott
Our Newest Friends
Over recent weeks through Lesley’s blog and around the offices you may have heard about our ‘Friends’ event. This took place on 30th October and marked the launch of our new ‘Friends’ network.
So who are our ‘Friends’ and what’s the purpose of the network? Historically within PSS we’ve had a ‘members’ network, this was part of our Governance structure and these people were involved in our work in a variety of ways.
In years gone by they were a key part of what PSS did; fundraising and running events but as time has gone on and the structure of what we do has changed this role has become less relevant. Consequently, their only involvement in recent years has been attendance at the AGM or receiving a copy our annual report.
Last year the Leadership Team discussed the role of the ‘members network’ and the idea of changing this to the ‘Friends of PSS’ was formed. This less formal network will invite past members, influencers in the areas we work in and other key stakeholders to be more closely involved in what we do; going beyond fundraising and using the networks of our ‘Friends’ to build our profile, offer resources and professional time and to introduce us to new opportunities.
Going forward, we plan to host a series of ‘Friends’ events and to invite these people to other celebrations we run throughout the year. This will help us to share more about what we’re doing with the people who matter, to share the stories of the people we work with and to hopefully excite them about the direction we’re going in.

Don’t Worry Wins National Award



 
December 2, 2013
Rachael Stott
Don’t Worry Wins National Award
Young people from our Family Impact service have been working with our ‘parental imprisonment’ lead Lorna Brookes over recent months to put together a book to support children with a parent in prison. The group had noticed that everything they’d come across to support them as a child of a prisoner had been written by adults and not by someone else who was in the same position.
The team pulled together quotes and illustrations from young people using the service and structured them into the ‘Don’t Worry’ book. The book is just about to go to print for the first time and we’re hoping it’ll be a really useful tool to raise awareness around what the team do nationally. We’re definitely off on the right foot in terms of profile; last week we found out that the ‘Don’t Worry’ project has been awarded the ‘Marsh Christian Award’ for voluntary work, through the organisation Action for Prisoners’ Families.
The young people were absolutely thrilled but because they couldn’t make the London presentation they pre-recorded a video for the event. Lorna who collected the award on their behalf was thrilled about the recognition and is incredibly excited about sharing the book both inside and outside PSS.

Sefton Young Carers Share Their Views

Sefton Young Carers Share Their Views
During the Autumn, the organisation ‘Aintree Volunteers’ received some funding from the Carers Trust to hold an event to raise awareness of carers and the important work of volunteers in the local community. The group approached our Sefton Young Carers services and pulled together plans to hold a mini Young Carers conference to raise awareness of their issues.
Our team worked with Aintree Volunteers to put an event together that would appeal to our young people. We had information stands at the event to share information with the young carers. This included organisations such as Barclays Bank, Connexions and Sefton’s Carers Centre. Therapies for the young people to try were also available, including a craft card making activity, a session on CV writing, and a raffle where everyone won a prize with one lucky person winning an ipad.
The young carers who attended this event really enjoyed it and found it really useful in terms of opportunities for the future.
we’d like to say a big thank you to aintree volunteers for approaching us and also to the sefton young carers team who worked really hard to make the event a success

A Meeting of Two Halves
At the end of October our Wales team decided to have a Fancy Dress theme and enjoy a slightly more informal event. However, the meeting really became one of two halves because attending the meeting was Mandy Williams, the inspector for our services in Wales.
During this first section Becky Steen (Head of Service for Wales) discussed participation and involvement and everyone in the Group chatted about how they as individuals made decisions and actively participate in the decision making process within the family setting that is Shared Lives. This was a lively and very interactive group discussion.
During the second part of the meeting the fancy dress costumes came into their own and the team ran a craft session where service users and team members made Halloween spiders and pumpkins.

During November Lesley enjoyed a day visiting our services in Wales, meeting some of our Shared Lives families and spending time with Tegan.
We met Tegan, our play development service in North Wales in the last edition of the Loop and Lesley was delighted to see it in action.
Here she is with Kate Wilkinson who setup the TRIO service in Wales. Kate’s actually off on maternity leave at the moment but she’d popped along with her baby Henry, which was a lovely coincidence.
As the picture shows, it was a very enjoyable day!

Fancy a Visit to Our House?



 
November 1, 2013

Fancy a Visit to Our House?
Collaboration of partners who have received Government funding to try out new ways to improve health and independence in Liverpool.
There are four pilot programmes in the UK, and in Liverpool the partnership includes Liverpool NHS, charities PSS and Hft, Riverside Housing and technology companies Philips and Tunstall. It has received more than £7m in funding.
Mi aims to do a number of things, including:

helping people to take charge of their health, wellbeing and lifestyle
using technology to allow people to feel safer and more independent in their own homes
reducing over reliance on health and social care services by supporting people to feel confident enough to do more for themselves at home

Mi is for everybody, not only those experiencing health and care issues. Mi can help those looking to the future and planning the next stages of their lives. The technology and services available through Mi are pioneering and can make a real difference to not only those who use it, but their families and carers as well.
So what is a smart house?
The Smart House showcases a selection of the tools available and demonstrates how they can help. There is also a telephone helpline with specially trained staff, able to advise upon the products, how they can help make your life easier, and ways to fund them. A Smart House has been built both physically – based in The Museum of Liverpool – and also virtually, on an easy-to-use interactive website.
Some of the items used-known as Life Enhancing Technology (LET) – include:

tools to simply make life easier, such as gadgets to control TV, open your curtains and a phone where you press a photo of the person you want to call
security enhancements, such as a finger-print entry lock and video to see who is at the door
door prompts that give you certain messages, such as reminding you of your dietary requirements when you open the fridge door
a gadget to prompt you to take your medicines
telecare phone sensors that alert you or others to a situation in the home
special devices that alert others if you are away from your bed for too long
sensors that inform you or others of certain situations, such falls, a wet bed, or an epileptic fit
baths that automatically unplug when too full, and warn you if the temperature is too hot

Mi technology can change the way you live –offering you and your family a greater sense of security within your homes, and allowing you to live a more independent life.
In addition, hundreds of trained Mi ‘Champions’ are working within the community, talking to people about their health and social needs, helping them to become more active and more involved.
All of the technology shown at the Smart House is for sale and for people already in receipt of social care funding from their local authority and/or NHS, it is likely that all or some of the costs of the equipment will be met. Funding advice is also available to make the items affordable to all.
What’s great is that PSS has now taken the lead on the Smart House and has recruited 3 new posts to work at the Museum of Liverpool. Their role will be to welcome visitors, provide interactive tours and give information about the gadgets. They are also looking for ideas as to what else they can get the visitors involved in, if you have got any thoughts let them now.
What’s even better is that the 3 new recruits where all PSS Supporters. There are loads of reasons why Supporters make great employees, ranging from those who already know our organisation and values to those who we have seen their many skills and qualities in action not just on an application form.
Michael has been working with the Mi Team for 18th months during his college holidays. He just keeps coming back to help out in what ever way he can whether that is getting stuck in with the Urban Green Team or installing and testing new apps on the iPads.
Tom has just completed his level 3 Health Trainer qualification that he will use to point people on the right path to becoming healthier. He’s also confessed to being a techie at heart and is a big fan of the Smart House.
Paul who is a Mi Champion came on board after working with the Mi team on a project in North Liverpool. He is also a Duke of Edinburgh Award assessor and wants to get more outdoor activities happening in the city.
The Smart House is open 11am to 4pm every day so feel free to call round and say Hi to the new team.

Tim’s Walking Challenge



 
October 22, 2013
Rachael Stott
Tim’s Walking Challenge
Tim is a Shared Lives Carer who lives in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, and supports a brother and sister who are now in their 20s but have been living with him since they were children. All three are involved in Crest, a locally run charity which provides social and sporting opportunities for people with learning and physical disabilities. Crest also supports children’s homes in Romania, raising money to equip community homes for young people leaving institutions, and visiting regularly to deliver toys, household items and specialist equipment. Tim and the two young people he supports are all hoping to participate in Crest’s visit to Romania next year.
In the meantime Tim, a keen walker, decided to set himself a challenge in order to raise money for Crest and the Romania project. In July, during our surprising heat wave, Tim walked round the whole of the coastal path of the Isle of Wight, a distance of 68 miles, in 23 hours 58 minutes. The challenge was to complete the distance in 24 hours, so Tim found himself running the last section, to end up at Ryde where he had started on the previous morning.
Tim makes light of his achievement but it’s clearly not one for the fainthearted (or those of us who are less fit). He did the whole walk without rest, just brief stops to take on water and food supplied by a friend who acted as support. He puts his success down to good preparation (he walked 87 miles along the Trent and Mersey canal on a training weekend), plenty of water, and his Panama hat. He suffered no injuries or blisters. He says ‘it was an amazing experience, one I’ll never forget, the weather was fantastic and I saw the island at its best.’

Shared Lives carer Sandra urges others to open their homes to vulnerable adults during Shared Lives Week

Shared Lives carer Sandra urges others to open their homes to vulnerable adults during Shared Lives Week 

Liverpool carer Sandra McKeown who took over the care of two vulnerable adults when her husband Ray died suddenly is leading a call for more carers to come forward during National Shared Lives Week.
Sandra is adding her voice to a campaign being supported by social enterprise PSS to urge people to open their homes to vulnerable adults to prevent social isolation that some people may experience in larger, less personal settings.
Run by PSS, Shared Lives is a form of support where vulnerable adults and young people over 16 live at home with a specially recruited and trained carer and their family.
Sandra cares for 86-year-old Phyllis and 50-year-old Ian from her home in Wavertree and says she could not have coped with Ray’s death without their support and companionship.
Ray was just 56 when he was diagnosed with cancer in January and died three weeks later.
“I was devastated and thought I would struggle to carry on but having Ian and Phyllis around helped me so much,” said Sandra. “I don’t have children and, whilst family came and went, Ian and Phyllis stayed right by my side for the whole time.
“We are like a little family and people who don’t know our circumstances assume we are all related.”
Sandra and Ray became Shared Lives carers four years ago when a friend of Ray’s suggested he would be an ideal candidate as he had considerable experience of caring for his daughter who has cerebral palsy.
Ray’s name was put forward to PSS and, following nine months of training and support, Ray and Sandra, opened their home to a teenage girl who was pregnant but was unable to keep her baby.
After that they specialised in providing short breaks for young men with autism before Ian joined them four years ago and Phyllis two years ago. Both are vulnerable adults and Ian also has epilepsy.
“Ray was fantastic with Ian and really helped to build his confidence and self- esteem,” continued Sandra. “When Ray died I asked Ian if he would prefer to live with a male carer but he said no, he wanted to stay with me.
“I help Phyllis and Ian with their day to day living, medical appointments and any medication they may be on, and we basically share each other’s lives, watching the soaps, eating together and enjoying family occasions.
“I would urge people to think about becoming a Shared Lives carer because it is incredibly rewarding and you receive lots of support. As a model for living it makes a lot of sense and I know I get as much out of it as Ian and Phyllis, if not more.
“They have been absorbed into my family and we provide company and support for each other.”
Shared Lives, formed more than 30 years ago, is focused around choice and independence with careful matches made between carers and the people they care for.
The aim is to allow people to pursue ordinary lives within their chosen families and relationships and to feel valued within the community.
A national report on Shared Lives recently concluded that this innovative home-based form of care is transforming the lives of almost 10,000 people nationally.
However, there is a desperate shortage of carers in Merseyside and PSS is now looking to recruit carers willing to share their homes with a vulnerable adult.
Carers receive training, support, a fee and can provide anything from a short break to long term care.

A Problem Shared Could Be a Problem Solved

A Problem Shared Could Be a Problem Solved
Recently SJ, who uses our services was unfortunately admitted to hospital in the Wirral and even more unfortunately his experience of care was not positive due to his learning disability. Luckily SJ’s Carers decided to step in and support the NHS Trust responsible to become more aware of the needs of people like SJ. The Carer explained that SJ’s learning disability was not taken into account and listed a catalogue of incidents that put SJ at severe risk during his stay.
After making an official complaint the family eventually met with several top people in the hospital. The Carers made several suggestions around supporting a person with a learning disability during their stay in hospital. This included wearing a discrete yellow band (the same as people who wear a red band if they have an allergy), they also suggested a different colour pillowcase just to alert staff that this person may need additional support.
The Carers are really pleased that the hospital appears to be genuinely impressed with their suggestions and are looking to put measures in place. The hospital has also asked the Carer to give a talk on what it is like to be in hospital if you have a learning difficulty and how hospitals can makes simple changes to make life easier for everybody.

We’re Getting Better and Better All the Time

We’re Getting Better and Better All the Time
By Jane Evans, Head of Quality Management.
Well hello everyone, if I haven’t already met you my name is Jane Evans and I joined PSS a couple of months ago. My first impression of PSS has been how warm and welcoming people have been to me – I’ve never worked anywhere that compares, and I’ve worked in lots of places over the years. Most recently I was a Commissioning Manager and Personalisation lead.
So, I’m here as the Head of Quality Management, a completely new post at PSS, and although I’ve had a strong sense of what quality is, as I’ve talked to people about their work and services I’ve been keen to ask people what they think quality is and what they think my role should be.
What struck me is the shared view we all have of quality –“it’s what I’d want”, or “I’d want it for my mum”; “it’s in everything we do”;” it’s making a better life for people”. It also struck me how proud people are of the services we offer, and nobody I spoke to could talk to me without sharing a story about somebody they supported whose life had literally turned around.
So our shared view is that quality is about people having a good experience of support; of us providing services that are safe; and providing services that are effective i.e. have a real impact on people’s lives.
Do I have anything to do here, then? Well, I guess I still think I do! People did have concerns about being able to show and evidence what we do. It is not always easy to find the right policies or guidance in the right place –and people wanted to get even better at what they did and the services they offer. I think this reinforces what I think my role is about – driving forward a shared vision for quality and for quality improvement and in supporting and helping evidence what good quality looks like, at the front line with the people we support.
What I’d like you to do is to think about your own role in quality –what can you do to make a real difference to people’s lives and offer an even better service to all who use it?
And finally, a story of my own. Many years ago, soon after I qualified as an Occupational Therapist I was asked to see a lady who’d had a really quite mild stroke, but had become depressed and tearful about it all. She was an elderly lady with a loving and caring family. One day we talked about baking and I suggested she made scones – good for hand control etc. On Monday she was transformed –she’d made scones for her family, but you know it was only years later it dawned on me that the making of scones was about her aspirations and what mattered to her in life – to be an important part of the family, to be a giver in the family, to have her role confirmed back.
I hope this story leaves you with an uplifted feeling about your everyday contribution to the lives of others, you should all be very proud and I look forward to working with you to change even more lives for the better.
Thanks for reading
Jane

Enable Team Day



 
September 1, 2013
Rachael Stott
Enable Team Day
The first Enable team building day took place in August. The team met at Seel St and started with a treasure hunt (which got off to a good start as Anna gave out the answers instead of the instructions and questions! Whoops!)
With 23 questions to answer and 7 tasks to carry out the team followed a route around Liverpool city centre. After they had completed the treasure hunt they all met up for some refreshments and to count scores and identify the winners.
Team members told us how much they enjoyed the afternoon, particularly meeting up with colleagues who they wouldn’t normally see.
Anna would like to say a big thank you to all those who were able to take part for making it a really positive day.

Fun in the Rain



 
August 28, 2013

Fun in the Rain
On 30th July in anticipation of continued great weather, the Liverpool Health Trainer team arranged a team bonding away day in Sefton Park, just outside the city centre. Just as the team were tucking into a picnic (a very healthy one of course!) they had to dash for cover from a torrential downpour. However, being true Brits, and not being deterred by a bit of rain they persevered with a health quiz, a game of rounders, a three legged race and a number of other physical activities. Everyone on the team had lots of fun and it was a great chance for the new health trainers to really get to know the rest of the team.

We Couldn’t Do It without You
Across PSS we have hundreds of people who give their time to us free of charge. Each one of these people makes a vital contribution to ensuring our services are both high quality and available to as many people as possible.
During the summer we are holding Supporter’s events across the UK to celebrate their achievements and within this we gave out six ‘values-based’ awards. But before we tell you about the nominations and winners we wanted to share a bit about what our supporters are doing across the UK. Here’s a bit of a taste…

Barnsley Health Trainers: 70 people support the work of our team in developing and facilitating activities such as sports groups or even building allotments.
Liverpool Wellbeing Centres: 10 people, including some trained peer supporters, use their skills to support or facilitate creative and fun activities, such as a reading, gardening, crafts or singing.
UK-wide Shared Lives: 20 people regularly take part in our Shared Lives Carers’ Panels. These panels consist of specially selected individuals who use their invaluable expertise to recruit new carers across England, Wales and Scotland.
Liverpool Dementia Befrienders: a team who are carefully matched with people who have a diagnosis of dementia, helping to reduce isolation.
North West Spinning World: a team of people bringing their extremely specialist skills to help provide counselling services to our clients.
Merseyside Family Impact Service: a group of professional supporters who help us to deal with some extremely sensitive cases. Our supporters also take part in activities as part of our Family Day Service at HMP Altcourse.
Wirral Shared Living Service: Edna Clements currently supports the tenants across all of the sheltered housing schemes. Edna arranges a wide range of activities, striving to improve the quality of life of these individuals.
Liverpool Central Services: Ruth Pemberton has supported PSS for over 10 years, has continued to offer a superb, friendly, reliable and dedicated service as part of our Front of House Team.
Liverpool Bretherton: Janet Quiqley currently supports the Enable Service and has been with PSS for almost 10 years.
Scotland Campsie Office: Tommy Morrison has supported our Scottish team for more than 15 years and assists with everything, from office administration to organising social events or supporting the carers’ assessment process.
Board of Trustees: 9 people who give their time to oversee our operations as an organisation. They ultimately take responsibility for our organisation’s finances and sustainability.
Toxteth Wellbeing Service: 50 people from a range of cultural backgrounds promoting wellbeing messages and events in their community.
Liverpool ‘Mi’ champions: 50 people who are trained to promote well-being in the north of the city.
The fantastic support listed here, and the winners to the right, illustrate how lucky we are as an organisation.
Our top award for ‘Trust’ went to: Tham Lodders
Tham has worked tirelessly to gain the trust of the people he supported in Family Impact, despite studying and raising his two children on his own.
Our top award for ‘Potential’ went to: David Walshaw
David has been supporting our Barnsley Health Trainer team for, on average, 30 hours per week for 18 months. He leads physical activity sessions and has recently obtained his FA disability coaching badges
Our top award for ‘Bravery’ went to our Family Impact Young People. Aged 10-14, this group have direct experience of an imprisoned parent. Despite their ages, they spoke at the national ‘Action for Prisoners’ Families’ conference in Birmingham, sharing their views and experiences.
Our top award for ‘Understanding’ went to Diane Dickson
Diane is a Champion for our Mi service and, in particular, helps us to promote better mental health across the city. She’s had struggles of her own, which she happily shares, and is an incredibly positive character.
Our top award for ‘Choice’ went to Frank Ford
As our ‘Chief Walk Leader’ and one of the key network builders within our Mi service, Frank does some incredible work. His work is never finished, and he has an incredible passion for what he does.
Our top award for ‘Improvement’ went to Sue White
Whilst overcoming her own problems Sue has set up a range of art sessions at Liverpool’s Umbrella Centre, and she has inspired others along the way. She also used her brilliant talents to design the colour palette for the new PSS branding.

A Summer of Platinum Celebrations for Fred



 
July 30, 2013
Rachael Stott
A Summer of Platinum Celebrations for Fred
This Summer the ‘Battle of the Atlantic’ was celebrated in Liverpool, with visiting Navy ships, memorial events and commendation for the nation’s many naval heroes. Involved in the event and congratulated throughout the weekend was one of our own, Fred King who uses our ‘at home’ support services at John Willis House in the Wirral. Tracy Morris, the scheme manager at John Willis House was keen to share his story and we’re delighted she did.
Fred King was born in Tottenham, London in 1922 and in 1940, at the age of 18, joined the crew of HMS Gentian at Gladstone Dock, Bootle. Fred was based on this ship throughout the remainder of World War II and during this time played his part in the Atlantic convoys. In the role of ‘stoker’ Fred spent most of his time in the engine room keeping the ship powered and his recollections of the time spent on board are incredibly vivid.
In 1942, the ship returned to Liverpool and the crew were allowed some well earned leave while the ship had modifications carried out to her guns. All crew with local connections were allowed ashore. At the time Fred had to remain with the ship because he only had connections in the South of England, but later in the same period of leave when HMS Gentian was moved to Clover Dock in Birkenhead for modifications, he was temporarily billeted at Birkenhead YMCA, which was requisitioned by the Admiralty at that time. During his stay at the YMCA, Fred met Susie Buckley, the YMCA cook and the following year they were married.
At the end of the war Fred received the ‘Atlantic Star Medal’ as a symbol of recognition for his commitment and efforts during the war, something that was reinforced by his role during this Summer’s Merseyside Battle of the Atlantic celebration events. The whole team at PSS would like to congratulate Fred for this deserved recognition and also congratulate him and Susie who on July 6 this year celebrated 70 years of marriage.

When I need to talk through a problem at school





When I need to talk through a problem at school
Seedlings
What is Seedlings?
Seedlings is a therapeutic service based in 120 primary schools. Delivered in partnership by PSS and Young Person’s Advisory Service (YPAS) and funded by Liverpool Child and Adolescent Mental Health services (CAMHS), the Seedlings team works with children to explore and process feelings that are troubling them and develop confidence in expressing themselves. Sometimes when children are growing up, changes at home or at school can be difficult to deal with. The Seedlings team support the emotional needs of children allowing them to develop, grow and to build their resilience. Difficult feelings can affect relationships with important people in our lives, when these feelings are expressed in therapy it becomes easier to understand and make sense of them.
What our team does:
Our qualified therapists provide a range of support that is age appropriate and tailored to what each child needs. This includes both 1:1 sessions and group work that can use a range of techniques including:
• Talking therapies
• Arts therapies
• Support and advice for families
• Providing education and resources to help staff deal with difficult emotional issues
Why are children referred to this service?
Children could be referred to Seedlings for a whole range of reasons, including a lack of confidence in their school work, peer relationships and difficulties at home. Sessions with a therapist can allow them some dedicated space and time to explore any issues that may arise. It could be a member of staff or a parent or carer who notices a change in a child’s behaviour. A child may also ask for support. Anyone can refer to the Seedlings team.
Whatever a child is dealing with, Seedlings provides a safe environment where children can creatively share their personal story. If you have any concerns about a child’s emotional wellbeing, it is always worth speaking to a member of the Seedlings team to see if we can help.
Early intervention is key to assisting children achieve their full potential, enabling them to build a strong foundation which they can carry through life.
The PSS Seedlings team have particular expertise in working with children from culturally diverse backgrounds, and they can help children for whom English is not their first language or children who are seeking asylum in the UK.

Hospital Domestic Abuse Service





Hospital Domestic Abuse Service

Our team operate within The Royal Liverpool Hospital, Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and also at the ISIS Centre; our women only safe space in Kirkdale. The service is here to prevent further risk or injury to women experiencing domestic abuse, whether they are receiving treatment for DV related injuries or disclosing the abuse while they are at the hospital for another reason.
We provide a crisis response service that helps women to change their immediate circumstances and break free from domestic abuse. This aspect of the service is provided discreetly by our team who are based at the hospital. We have supported a number of women to bring charges against their abusive ex partners.
We also offer ongoing services for women. We support those we work with to find the services they need, improve their wellbeing and make other life changes to help ensure their future is positive, safe and free from domestic abuse. Our team are experienced in working with women who have practical, personal and emotional difficulties. We offer one to one support including: legal advice, advocacy, guidance through the criminal Justice System, accommodation support, guidance around civil or family matters, substance abuse, benefit and debt management, employment, education, health and wellbeing. We also offer a wide range of group sessions around some of these issues.
These services run slightly differently across the two hospital sites we work in, but their aim remains the same in all locations.
How To Refer:
All referrals to the project must come through the hospital’s own safeguarding team. Contact them to get a referral form.
However, if you’re concerned about someone who is currently in either the Royal Liverpool or Aintree Hospital and would just like advice, feel free to contact us directly.

Pamela Oden, Head of Service Midlands



 
Pamela Oden, Head of Service Midlands
I am the Head of Service for the Midlands; which involves ensuring all our services comply with CQC standards, and working with commissioners in the development of our services.
I bring to the table almost 18 years’ experience working in social care settings in various roles, and over 7 years as a registered manager of Shared Lives. I aim to bring knowledge, a commitment to ongoing service improvement and a problem solving approach to the table. I am keen to learn from my colleagues and to celebrate our successes
With my spare time I have grandchildren that I like to see as often as I can they live in different parts of England so I usually have them for part of the school holidays. I see my mum at weekends we usually go shopping for bargains and go somewhere to eat. I still go to the occasional punk gig, I’m interested in politics and travel to Istanbul with my husband quite often too .

Ian Travis, Head of IT
My role within SMT is to provide insight in all matters related to technology
I bring a number of years of working within different IT environments to Service Manager Meetings. I also have teaching experience. This enables me to provide understandable explanations and to suggest realistic solutions to the technological challenges that PSS face on a daily basis.
My daughter has recently turned two so a lot of my time is taken up with her! Apart from her I enjoy a variety of sports (Man Utd boo hiss!) and like to travel whenever possible. I am also a keen runner.

Who We Are » Our Team » Senior Management Team » 
Michelle Cooksey, Head of People & Culture



 
Michelle Cooksey, Head of People & Culture
 I work in partnership with regional and central management teams to identify and deliver effective business -focused HR solutions offering advice, guidance and coaching on employment law and employee relations along the way. 
I have over 20 years’ experience in management and HR with a wide experience in employment law and employee relations. I like to think I have a clear logical mind with a practical and analytical approach to solving complex employment matters. Above all, I like to ensure that myself and my team are approachable and friendly bunch!
In my spare time I enjoy baking and get to try out my recipes on the team, although there’s always their favourites like banana cake or for the more health conscious low fat raspberry muffins. I also like escaping a few times a year for long walks with my partner, ranging from low-level walking in the Lake District to more strenuous walks in the mountains including places like Austria and Slovenia. When I’m not feeling energetic, there’s nothing like a lazy weekend with a pizza and bottle of wine!

Emma Titley, Head of Learning & Engagement



 
Emma Titley, Head of Learning & Engagement
I am responsible for ensuring the learning and development needs of our staff, carers and supporters are identified and met; lead on staff engagement initiatives; and provide advice and guidance on issues including apprenticeships, qualifications, coaching and leadership development. I also manage the Universities Partnership Team who work with universities to provide placements for social work and nursing students.
I bring with me twenty years’ experience of supporting and developing people at all organisational levels. Most of my career has been spent in the public sector and while some of the training we put on at PSS is very different to what I’ve been responsible for commissioning in the past, the way that we make sure people have the skills and knowledge needed to deliver excellent services is the same. I am really enjoying working with the different teams at PSS to learn what they do, how they work and understand their aspirations which is key to developing bespoke learning and development solutions for them.
I spend a lot of my spare time on motorways visiting friends from Cumbria to Devon and also love to travel further afield, especially to Canada and America. I’ve recently joined a gym and am an enthusiastic if not very speedy swimmer. As well as being new to PSS, I’m also new to Merseyside, so I’m enjoying learning about the local area.

Who We Are » Our Team » Senior Management Team » 
John Mclean, Head of Quality and Compliance



 
John Mclean, Head of Quality and Compliance
I am the Head of Service for Quality and Compliance across PSS; which involves ensuring that services deliver in line with our quality management model, that PSS as an organisation adheres to legislation and governance requirements, as well as overseeing the administration of information security, safeguarding alerts, impact reporting and surveys of our stakeholders.
I have a background in social care performance and quality both within local authorities and a national health organisations; so I’ve got a good sense of what it’s like to be on the side of the commissioners, as well as that overview of what quality looks like nationally and how it can be evidenced.  I’m also always game for trying new methods, and seeing if we can do things to improve how we operate – and most of the time that’s working with all the PSS services I come into contact with.  The most important thing I bring to the table though, is ensuring that my team and I are approachable as a resource for everyone at PSS; our main aim is to help services be the best they can be.
In my spare time I  play badminton socially, and in a league as well as at international tournaments and have racked up 8 medals in 15 months travelling to Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands (to name but a few).  I love music and play piano and a little bit of guitar – but it’s just for fun, the X factor is definitely not in my future.  I enjoy going to pub quizzes with friends, and am a bit of a quiz buff.  Also, I love entertaining people and cooking and am about a third of the way through writing my own cookbook – which is an absolute labour of love.

Making Days
What is making days?
Our Making Days service provides structured day opportunities for adults with learning disabilities in both north and south Liverpool. Both services operate Monday to Friday 9-5 and together welcome over 100 individuals in any given week.
Support can range from full to half day sessions. Staff are committed to creating a real sense of community for the people who use the service, regardless of how much they attend.
Our team of support workers were all hired using values based recruitment, and we match each of them with service users based on shared interests and skill sets. They receive regular training and supervision and are focused on working closely with families, carers and other agencies as appropriate.
What makes us different?
Making days is all about helping people to get the most from their day to day lives. Our centres provide the opportunity for individuals to socialise with their friends, meet new people and to develop new skills and interests. Each person who attends the centre has a say in how their day is structured, and staff tailor support around the individual’s needs and goals.
Our activity programme is always growing and changing. Our teams are always looking for new activities to run and the programme is developed in partnership with the service users and their families.
Some of the activities we currently offer are: Football, Swimming, arts and crafts, Spanish language lessons, knitting, journalism, music groups and many more.
Who can access making days?
Making days be used by anyone over the age of 16 who has a diagnosed learning disability.
Making Days can be purchased through Local Authorities, the NHS, personal budgets, direct payments or privately by an individual or someone acting on their behalf.
Our service can be accessed through a referral from a social worker or another professional, or individuals can refer themselves. Just contact our team using the details to the right.

As I’m supported too
Siblings Service
We run a service called ‘Siblings’ in which we work with children and young people who have a brother or sister with a disability, complex need or life-limiting illness. Sometimes this child or young person can feel anger, embarrassment, guilt, isolation or even resentment towards their brother or sister and we work to help these young people manage such feelings.
What do we do? 
We provide the time and space for each young person to focus on enjoying themselves and encourage them to have lots of fun. Where someone wants to talk about their brother or sister we offer that opportunity and we encourage each young person to share their stories and experiences. Talking often helps them to understand that they are not alone and helps to equip them with tools to cope with their everyday lives. Our service has an open door policy, and when a young person needs us, we are there for them. Our main priority is that each young person feels comfortable, relaxed and most importantly welcome.
What activities take place? 
We have a large list of activities that we run including sports, cooking sessions, group games, discussions, arts and crafts, outdoor pursuits and fun days out.
Of course we are always open to ideas and like our young people to help us plan what we do.

5. What has made you stay?
Feeling part of the PSS family, I have had good line management, I feel humbled having the opportunity to be innovative in developing services, we provide quality service that make difference to service users and their loved ones. I didn’t have to go outside the organisation to have positive learning opportunities; I enjoy working with ‘like minded people’ with great senses of humour and the good social life with colleagues/peers.
6. Do you feel you’ve been supported in your personal development? How?
I have had the opportunity to remain within the organisation to gain experience working with many service user groups and with staff with a wealth of knowledge and expertise in various different settings.

Some of the opportunities I have had are amazing I initially went from being an adult social worker as a social work student I didn’t feel prepared to work with vulnerable children and their families. However during my time at PSS I have been able to develop a wealth of knowledge and expertise to enable me to change my career path to work children and their families. This has happened via good supervision/performance management. But also having the opportunity to shadow some really experienced dynamic PSS staff who were willing to share their skills knowledge and expertise with me to help me grow in to my role.

How PSS Can Help » Make My Family Stronger » 
As I Plan for My Future





As I Plan for My Future
Independent Supporters
Under new laws children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and their families will be able to have more say about the support they receive. This support will be written down in a Education, Health and Care Plan or an EHC plan for short. The EHC plan will replace Special Educational Needs statements and Learning Disability assessments and will focus much more closely on what they want to achieve and what support they need to achieve their goals. Right from the beginning their views and the views of their family will be at the centre of this plan.
Independent Supporters are here to help these families during the EHC assessment process, or when they’re moving over to their new EHC plan.
PSS are delivering the Independent Supporter service for the majority of the North West in partnership with Barnardos and Together Trust. We are responsible for all the Merseyside counties and have a strong team who are trained in the new reforms and ready to give advice that aims to benefit families who are affected.
Below we explain this role in more detail and help you to understand where it fits into the bigger picture.
What are Independent Supporters?
Independent Supporters are individuals with lots of skills and expertise in working with young people with Special Educational Needs and disabilities and their families. They are locally recruited in their area of work and have all completed accredited training so that they have a full understanding of the role and the changes taking place.
Our team of Independent Supporters work directly with a range of local partners to assess need and to help children and their families to get the support they need, when they need it. Our team are independent of any other service so can represent family and children’s point of view to other professionals.
What is the difference between Independent Supporters and Information, Advice and Support service (Formally Parent Partnerships)?
Sometimes the information given to children, young people and their families can be confusing. Therefore impartial advice and information is really important. This might help you make some big decisions. The Information advice and Support service is a really important part of this. However the workload that has been created as a result of these changes is very big and Independent Supporters are acting as an additional support service to work alongside  IASS by adding capacity and complimenting the work they are doing.
How do I request an Independent Supporter?
The Independent Support Service is available without any charge to eligible residents in the 29 local authorities.
Parents, carers and young people aged 16 to 25 can contact the Independent Support Service in their local authority by email or telephone, using the details provided below.

Who We Are » 
Our History



 
Our History
In 2019 our organisation will celebrate its 100th birthday, but even as the years mount up one thing’s for sure, we’re not slowing with age.
As an organisation we developed some of the best known names in community support including Age Concern, the Citizen’s Advice Bureau and Legal Aid. Today our team is continuing our legacy of innovation. We sit alongside Local Government and NHS services plugging the gaps and providing ‘on the ground’ support for a wide array of people. Our aim is simple and has been at the heart of what we do for a long time: to make the lives of those we work with better. In the 21st century we have evolved this mission to highlight the importance of encouraging people to choose their own support ‘We recognise when people are in need and help them find new and practical ways to get the most out of life’. To make this a reality we provide a range of services which work across a wide spectrum of personal experience and need. This is no mean feat, our work reaches far and wide but across the organisation we give our time, push our innovation, plan our resources and recruit our teams to ensure our experience and our dedication is shaped around the individuals we support.
As our track record should tell you; we never give up on finding the right service for each individual we work with. If we don’t have a service currently to meet their needs, we develop one and that is why we’ve been around for nearly 100 years… because we don’t wait for someone else to find the solutions, we create them.

Becky Bloor Steen, Head of Service: Wales



 
Becky Bloor Steen, Head of Service: Wales
I am the Head of Service and Registered Manager in Wales; this involves leading Wales based services by insuring compliance with regulations, strong and robust financial management, excellent engagement of team and all stakeholders and high quality service delivery. My role in SMT is to update other Senior Managers with key themes in Wales, changes to legislation, regulation and governmental changes. To keep colleagues informed of service specific matters and utilise their expertise where necessary. To share my skills where possible to support development across PSS.
I have worked in the sector of Health and Social Care for 14 years across many fields and have a strong knowledge of the cultural differences that Wales services encounter. I am a very patriotic person which ensures I keep Wales services high on the organisations agenda.  I am a dynamic and solution focused individual who likes to balance hard work with fun. I am values driven and love to work as part of a team.  Leading and developing people is a real passion and seeing people achieve and flourish is so satisfying to me.  I strive to ensure Team Wales enjoy what they do, deliver great services, continue to develop, grow and improve services in line with PSS objectives and have a positive influence and reputation in Wales.
I used to play football and netball for Wales but as the years go by I’m more of a watcher rather than a player! I enjoy walking, travelling and quality time with family and friends. I am a British Sign Language Translator and do a lot of voluntary work within the Deaf community. I’m also a Mindfulness Trainer and like to use those skills where possible in and outside of work. I believe life is too short and we should “Sing like no one’s listening, love like you’ve never been hurt, dance like nobody’s watching, and live like its heaven on earth.”

Sharon Edwards, Director of Finance



 
Sharon Edwards, Director of Finance
Sharon joined the PSS Leadership team in 2013 after working in posts in both the social enterprise and private sector in senior finance roles. Immediately before joining PSS Sharon was Director of Finance and HR at New Mind consultancy where she gained additional experience in working in IT. This was ideal for Sharon’s role in PSS as she also heads up our Business Technology Department. As part of her role Sharon is responsible for overseeing a team of varying experience ranging from senior accountants to apprenticeships. Personal development is a keen part of her focus within her team and already she has an apprentice who has become a full-time permanent employee.
Born and bred in Liverpool Sharon spends a lot of time being a step parent, she enjoys walking her dogs, and scuba diving whenever she gets the opportunity.

Veronica Jackson, Trustee



 
Veronica Jackson, Trustee
Veronica began her career in Northern Ireland working with North Down and Ards and Ulster Trusts, before moving to Liverpool Council as Assistant Executive Director of Supported Living, and going on to be Acting Director in the same area of work.
Her next move was to Oldham Council as Executive Director of Adult and Community Services, which became Executive Director for People, Communities and Society. She has worked extensively with councillors and service partners to transform social care, achieving this with Trade Union, staff and customer support for the measures. Her main interests are personalisation of services and performance improvement and she has led national initiatives in both these areas.
Veronica retired from her post in Oldham in March 2011, and became the Integrated Care Council Chair also in that month. Recently, she has completed work as peer challenger for the Local Government Association with a council that was assessed as inadequate two years ago. Through working with the Director of Adult Social Services on performance issues the council has now been assessed as performing well by the Towards Excellence in Social Care Board.
Veronica has also worked with Think Local Act Personal national forum, on the provider group, to improve market management in social care.

Equality and Diversity Policy





Equality and Diversity Policy
PURPOSE OF POLICY
The purpose of this policy is to ensure we have a culture where all individuals and specifically for this policy, the people we support, receive equal and fair treatment and where we can demonstrate our commitment to equality, diversity and human rights values and our commitment to non-discriminatory practice.
SCOPE OF POLICY

Trustees
Staff
Self-employed carers
Volunteers (supporters)
Students
People who use our services

This policy is communicated to all those covered in its scope with a requirement that it will be adhered to.
KEY LEGISLATION
The Equalities Act (2010)
Mental Capacity Act (2005)
The Human Rights Act (1998)
The Data Protection Act (1998)
ORGANISATIONAL COMMITMENT
PSS is committed to upholding the rights of the people we support to live their lives without experiencing discrimination or harassment, and that as far as possible we remove any barriers faced by people from different groups so they can achieve equal access to our services and experience equal outcomes.
We recognise that we support a diverse range of people and we will seek to understand and address their needs and wishes in a person-centred way, recognising them as an individual.
PSS will actively strive to combat prejudice and discrimination experienced by people who use our services, including that based on people’s ‘protected characteristics’ – Age, Disability, Sex, Sexual Orientation, Race (including ethnic or national origins, colour or nationality) , Religion or Belief (this includes lack of belief), Gender reassignment, Marriage or Civil Partnership, Pregnancy and Maternity.
PSS is committed to promoting human rights. This means that we observe and promote the core human rights principles of fairness, respect, equality, dignity, autonomy and participation for all.
Such a ‘human rights approach’ is consistent with our values. It emphasises the specific rights that everyone has, while still recognising their unique identities. We want to empower people, to treat them with the dignity that is their right, and to place them at the very centre of what we do. We emphasise people’s rights and entitlements, rather than their needs and requirements.
We will ensure people who use our services are able to exercise choice and control over the services they receive.
We will take steps to support people who use our services to be fully involved in making choices about their lives and the support they receive, including those who may have limited capacity in some aspects of their lives. We consider any differing level of participation by individuals and we consider what potential physical and/or social barriers there may be, e.g. language, format, proximity etc and take steps to address these.
Our staff will be trained in recognizing equality, diversity and human rights issues, and how they are to put these into practice in the course of their work.
Our staff will be trained in helping people who may have difficulties communicating, including for those with language barriers or disabilities. Our staff will understand best practice regarding communication techniques for different groups of people.
We will have information available in a range of formats which are accessible to the people who use our services.
We will help people access specialist services, such as Advocacy, people trained in sign language and specialist communication techniques.
We will take account of people’s preferences regarding the gender of staff where staff are providing personal care, and where appropriate in other types of care and support.
We will take account in support plans of people’s requirements in relation to their protected characteristics.
We will meet our obligations under the Equality Act to make reasonable adjustments to remove or alter physical features that prevent disabled people having equal access to our services.
We will promote the use of Assistive Technology to address barriers people may have to living the life they want.
We will monitor the delivery of services to ensure that people with diverse needs do not experience a poorer quality of service, and in particular we will monitor peoples experience who have protected characteristics. We will record sufficient personal data (whilst at the same time as adhering strictly to Data Protection principles) to be able to recognise whether service-users have protected characteristics. This will ensure we can take full account of these protected characteristics and specific requirements and/or needs related to them as we individually support plan with service-users.
MONITORING
The implementation of this policy will be monitored at local service level as well as at Board and Senior Management meetings.
RELATED POLICIES
This policy is closely linked to our Dignity at Work Policy which includes –

Our responsibilities to staff, including their recruitment, making reasonable adjustments in the workplace ,training in relation to equality and diversity
Our relationships with other organisations and expectations that they will adhere to equality and diversity principles
Monitoring the effectiveness of this organisational policy

It is also closely linked to our Service-User Inclusion Policy, and Service-user Inclusion Framework as we are committed to actively involving people in their support; in being proactive regarding feedback and in working in partnership with people and in so doing provide a voice for people most at risk from being excluded
It is also closely linked to our PSS’s Mental Capacity Act Policy, where issues of consent, fluctuating capacity, support to make choices, and advocacy are addressed.

Welsh Language Policy





Welsh Language Policy
Introduction
We acknowledge the fact that under the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 the Welsh language has official status, and should be treated no less favourably than the English language.
We believe that it is good business practise to provide services in the language of choice of our customers. We also believe that it shows respect to our workforce to encourage and facilitate the use of their chosen language in the workplace.
We will ensure that we make constant progress towards achieving this ambition, and this Welsh Language Policy sets out our current commitments in relation to using Welsh and also, where appropriate, sets targets to help us develop our use of Welsh.
The scope of our commitments in this policy should be interpreted reasonably – they are limited to activities and services in Wales or which are delivered to people living in Wales, and also limited to activities and services which we are able to control or influence.
Please direct any comments or complaints about this policy to:

Signage
All our permanent signs are fully bilingual.
We will ensure that all new permanent signs are fully bilingual.
Corporate Brand
Our corporate brand is in English only.
Our stationery and business cards are in English only. We will ensure that stationery and business cards are translated before 01/01/2014.
Website and Digital Services
Our website will be fully bilingual upon completion, and will be definitely bilingual by 01/01/2014.
Advertising and Marketing
Generally, our advertising is in English only in the Welsh press. Our recruitment advertising is in English only, although we specify that Welsh is desirable in all posts advertised.
We produce a Welsh version of every outdoor advertisement, and ensure that we always display advertisements in both languages together. We will ensure that we produce a Welsh version of every new printed publication and we will ensure that we always distribute and offer publications in both languages together.
Exhibition and Marketing Materials
All our exhibition and marketing materials are bilingual. We will ensure that all our new or revised exhibition and marketing materials are bilingual in Wales.

Communication
Tracking Language Choice
We record and track the language choice of our business contacts and we will continue to record and track the language choice of our business contacts when developing or updating our customer relationship management systems.
Face to Face Communication
In order to ensure that our customers can communicate with our staff in Welsh as often as possible, we will ensure that we have at least one member of staff able to speak some Welsh in any workplace where there is contact with the public. We encourage staff able to speak Welsh to wear a Working Welsh badge when they are at work. We will promote our Welsh medium face to face services by using the Working Welsh badge scheme.
Telephone Communication
We answer the telephone with a simple Welsh greeting before transferring the call. Every member of staff is able to recognise and handle a Welsh language call with courtesy. We will develop our bilingual telephone services to ensure that all staff are able to handle, or refer, Welsh medium calls in a professional, appropriate and courteous manner.
Correspondence (Paper and Electronic)
At the moment, we generally write to people in English. We acknowledge our customers’ freedom to correspond with us in Welsh and we will respond in their preferred language wherever it is practically possible. We will give positive consideration to bilingualism when sending and receiving correspondence, based on the nature and purpose of the correspondence.
Forms and Account documents
Our forms and account documents are in English only, as they come from a central office in Liverpool.
Staff and the Workplace
Assessing Language Skills Requirements when Recruiting
We consider what level of Welsh language skills are required to perform all new roles in our organisation. We will consider and record what level of Welsh language skills are required to perform each new position in our organisation. We will consider and record what level of Welsh language skills are required to perform certain positions within the organisation e.g. where there is direct contact with the public.
Recording and Developing our Staff’s Language Skills
We keep a record of the Welsh language skills of every employee. We share information about each employee’s Welsh language skills within the workplace, so that we can direct Welsh language enquiries to the appropriate person. We will assess and record the Welsh language skills of every new employee as they join our organisation.
We acknowledge that in Wales, the Welsh language should be treated no less favourably than the English language. We include Welsh language skills in our staff management and training processes, and we arrange and/or provide relevant training for staff who want to improve their Welsh language skills.
Internal Communication
We recognise that each member of staff and customer has the freedom to use the Welsh with each other, as enshrined in the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 and we expect staff to respect the linguistic preferences of their colleagues and customers. We will support and facilitate the use of Welsh and English in the workplace by creating opportunities for staff to use Welsh regularly.
Internal Publications
Our internal publications are in English only. We will use more Welsh in our internal publications wherever it is reasonable to do so.
Welsh language software
We allow our staff to install a Welsh language interface for any software they use which has a recognised Welsh language interface.
Leadership
We will ensure that this policy is supported at the highest level in our organisation. We will appoint one member of the Senior management team to be responsible for implementing, championing and reviewing this policy.
Awareness
This policy will be conveniently available for the public to read. Every member of staff will receive a copy of this policy and direction on its requirements.
Review
We will assess and revise this policy every year. This Welsh Language Policy will be presented to the Welsh Language Commissioner. We will prepare annual monitoring reports on its implementation.
Services delivered on our behalf
We encourage every contractor or third party that delivers services on our behalf to comply with this policy.
Disclaimer
The Welsh Language Commissioner’s template was used to compile this Welsh Language Policy. However, the Welsh Language Commissioner is not responsible for monitoring the standard of our Welsh medium provision. Any enquiries regarding the implementation of this policy should be directed to us at the address given on the front page.

Accessibility
PSS recognises the need for the website to be accessible to all. We have implemented a number of features to make this website easy to use, especially for users with disabilities.
This website aims to conform to Level A standard of the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. It also includes many features found in AA sites such as colour considerations and easily resizable fonts. We will continue to make improvements and make sure this website conforms to these guidelines.
Accessibility software
Our website features Browsealoud innovative support software  which adds speech, reading, and translation to every page facilitating access and participation for people with Dyslexia, Low Literacy, English as a Second Language, and those with mild visual impairments.
Languages
Online content can be translated at the click of a button using the Browsealoud software. Our site can also be read aloud in multiple languages using the most natural and engaging voice to transform the user’s reading experience.
Style Sheets
This site uses Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for visual layout. If your browser supports it, style sheets can be disabled or over-written to customise the appearance of the website, to your preference.
Font Sizes
You can change the font size of each page to your preference through the browser.

In Internet Explorer: select View, then Text Size, and then your preferred size.
In Firefox: press CTRL + to increase font size and CTRL – to decrease. CTRL 0 will reset sizes to default.

Forms
Labels are used to assist access to form fields. All forms follow a logical tab sequence.
Tables
Tables are used to display tabular data. Tables are not used for general site layout. This means our tables are being used in a correct and meaningful manner.
Colours
The site has been designed to be easy to read through its colour combinations.
Links
We have worked hard to ensure that our links are meaningful, and some links are explained in greater detail by using a title attribute.
Scripting
JavaScript is used on the site to improve usability. All pages and processes are still accessible and usable if JavaScript is disabled or unavailable.
Browsers
This website is built to HTML5 and CSS 2.0 / 3.0 standards.
This website will function and look as intended in browsers that support these standards. The most common of these are:

Firefox 8 +
Internet Explorer 9.0+
Chrome

If you do not have one of these browsers installed or are unable to upgrade, you may find the website easier to use by disabling CSS altogether – please see your browsers help documentation for further information.
Standards Compliance
Our pages aim to conform to Level A compliance as specified by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. This standard is endorsed by the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) and the Disability Rights Commission.
Our pages use valid HTML5 and CSS. To ensure code quality and that standards are maintained we are committed to checking this on a regular basis.
We are striving to meet our obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 with respect to the provision of services online. http://www.drc-gb.org/

Learning and Development





Learning and Development
At PSS we believe in developing our staff, carers and supporters so they can make a difference to the lives of everyone who accesses our services. We do this through a structured induction programme for all new starters, internal and external training courses and the opportunity to gain qualifications in the workplace to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge and skills they need.
All staff at PSS have an individual action plan which includes the learning and development objectives they have identified for the year ahead with their line manager. The range of ways people achieve their objectives include both formal and informal learning opportunities and we encourage staff to develop themselves professionally and personally in order to reach their full potential.
Our values drive both what we do and how we do it for the services we deliver and this applies equally to learning and development. The Learning and Engagement Team works closely with all the PSS teams to identify their learning and development needs and source training solutions to meet them. We recognise that with limited financial resources we have to be creative in how we meet these needs and we are currently looking at how we can use our in-house expertise in areas including safeguarding, health & safety, IT, domestic violence, assertiveness and mindfulness.
The ways we learn at PSS are made up of some of the more classic ways to routes; attending conferences, getting a mentor, shadowing a more senior team member or joining a professional body. We also have some that are slightly different but which work towards building our organisational culture. This include things like: learning to meditate, reading political news each day, watching TED talks and managing a kid’s football team. Although not always directly relevant to an individuals role, we encourage this creativity. If we didn’t, how do we know our team are looking after their own mental health, staying up to date on policy, learning from people with specialist knowledge or ensuring they have the patience and leadership to manage an enthusiastic team?

Friends
Our Friends network is made up of people from a range of backgrounds who want to help PSS achieve our mission to help people get the most out of life. Each month we have new members joining but some of our Friends have been linked to the organisation for many decades.
Our Friends are kept up to date through our quarterly magazine the Loop in addition to receiving invites to celebration events and special open days.
We ask our Friends to support us in any way they can whether that be by providing expert support, resources, financial support or helping us raise awareness of what we do. Currently we have over 50 Friends some of them from partner organisation, some long-standing supporters, some academics and some politicians. Each one of them adds value to our network in a different way.
If you’re interested in becoming a PSS Friend or if you know someone who might be, please email us at friends@pss.org.uk.

Advocates and Ambassadors



 
Advocates and Ambassadors
Of the thousands of people we’ve supported over recent years we have a good percentage who want to give something back. This might be because we’ve helped them and they want to thank us, but it also might be because they remember the situation they were in and don’t want anyone else to feel the same.
Our Advocates and Ambassadors are people with personal experience of certain challenges and/or the profile and connections to help others understand what those in need are going through.
As a rule our Ambassadors are people who are well known in the local area or field in which they are showing their support. They may have suffered from a mental health problem personally, have a family member with a disability or just be from a certain city or town with a desire to help those nearby.
Our Advocates on the other hand tend to have had direct experience of one of the fields of our work and in many cases they’ve actually use our services. These people can advocate for what we do because they know what we’re about and they can vouch for the work we do. Advocates don’t need to have local profiles, national fame or lots of money in the bank. They’re people who have been in the same shoes as those people entering our services and they’re there to help others find the way through our door and wherever possible back out again

We rely on a bank of volunteers across the UK to help keep our services running. As a third sector organisation we run on a tight budget and this means that additional support us always gladly accepted.
Our volunteers range from community gardeners to customer service staff and they include both people inside and outside of our own services. Sometimes getting involved in our PSS volunteer programme is the first bit of formal work our volunteers have undertaken in a while and for some it’s all part of a new venture into a career in the third sector. Whatever your reasons for wanting to get involved you don’t need to have previous experience. You just have to be keen to take part in our training programme and committed to finding the place you fit in the organisation in terms of skills and your own interests.
Take a look at our opportunities and, if you think one is the right role for you, please return the form to:
PSS Supporter Opportunities, 18 -24 Seel Street, Liverpool, L1 4BE.
At the moment we require hard copies of the forms, but over the coming months we’ll be making it possible to return the forms electronically.

Each year we provide university placements to over 50 students. We have links with a range of universities including Liverpool Hope, Liverpool John Moors, Manchester Metropolitan, Sheffield Hallam and international universities including the University of Stockholm. We think it is a vital part of personal development to be involved in work directly with the people we support particularly if you’re going into a career in social care. However the importance of experience goes beyond this degree and we also offer placements to students of other disciplines including HR, Finance, Marketing and Customer Service.
To find out more about our social care placement opportunities contact our Learning and Development Partnerships Manager Rose Devereux at placements@pss.org.uk. Alternatively, if you’re looking for a role in other disciplines please contact the relevant member of the Leadership or Senior Management team.

What Our Team Think



 
What Our Team Think
Every 18 months we run our ‘tell us’ staff survey. We ask a series of questions recommended by ‘Great Places to Work’, the organisation who publish the 100 Best Workplaces each year. Below we share some of the results with you from our most recent survey.
The five themes of the questions are:

Respect
Fairness
Credibility
Camaraderie
Pride

Our 2013 results
We’re delighted to say that we have improved scores against every single question in our 2013 survey and have met or exceeded our own targets. In some areas we even hit our 2014 targets a year early.
Key results

82% of staff feel they are offered training or development to further themselves professionally
86% of our team believe our senior management is effective and can be trusted to lead PSS
The vast majority of questions relating to Credibility scored above 80%.
90% of people believe they are treated fairly in PSS regardless of their position.
A Family and Friends score of 37 (we ask the question ‘would you recommend PSS as an employer to your friends or family’). This is a great result as the scale goes from -100 to 100. Those who were promoters (scoring 9 or 10 out of 10) said excellent opportunities, investment in staff, an ethical stance and vision, a warm friendly, caring place to work and enjoying coming to work at PSS as the main reasons for their score). The friends and family score isn’t as simple as percentage, it’s actually made up of quite a complex calculation. To find out more click here.

Comments left at the end of the survey included:
I feel we are a very passionate organisation that deliver excellent services and provide fantastic opportunities/careers for employees
The work ethic here is very good and the team work together to help each other out. Many of the team get on and socialise outside of work and have built up friendships regardless of age or gender. The atmosphere is generally great and coming to work is fulfilling and fun!
You are valued as a person and your skills valued no matter how small
I really am happy with my job. I feel I have total support and that we are encouraged to progress and dream big
I believe PSS is a caring, loyal and trustworthy organisation. Every staff member will go the extra mile to make things happen, make things right, make a difference and make the PSS name be remembered for all the right reasons.
The response rate was 62% up from 43% in the previous year.
Over the next 12-18 months we want to improve our results even more. We plan to:

Implement a new career and talent development framework
Implement our new internal communications plan including a new intranet
Implement the next Learning and Development strategy and plan
Widen staff access to ICT via our new business technology strategy
Run a staff consultation on our new pay framework
Continue our staff health and wellbeing programme including mindfulness and yoga sessions.

Staff Awards Programme
We take our values very seriously and for this reason we not only recruit by them but we run our staff awards by them. Each year we take nominations from across PSS in the form of stories and present their awards during our Autumn staff roadshows.
We have six values and our six awards last year were spread across the team from the Wirral to Sheffield. In our news pages you can read the winning tales from the teams who were successful in 2013.

Impact Reporting



 
Impact Reporting
To get a true idea of our impact we use social impact reporting. We use both in-house team members and external consultants to assess what changes our work is making in terms of people’s outcomes and also savings to public funders.
In early 2014 we finished the first of our formal Impact reporting pilots with our Post Natal Depression service. This helped us to assess the various outcomes for different stakeholders and to find the key indicators which showed where changes had happened. This process is now an ongoing tool for the PND team and they are championing the roll out of ‘PSS’ Social Impact Toolkit’ that they helped to develop across the rest of the teams.
Alongside this we are also looking at introducing a ‘bolt-on’ aspect of Social Return on Investment (SROI) through our work with the specialist team from Liverpool John Moores University and our Quality and Compliance Team.
Currently all of our services provide qualitative feedback and data on the impact of their services which is shared with commissioners regularly. We’ve now started to provide quantitative reports for commissioners and funders to show the social and economic impact of the services we deliver.

Commitment to Quality



 
Commitment to Quality
Across PSS we have a shared view of what quality is. Ask our teams and you’ll be told “it’s what I’d want”, “I’d want it for my mum”, “it’s in everything we do” or “it’s making a better life for people”. Our teams are incredibly proud of the services we offer and every PSS person is committed to providing high quality services.
Each year we conduct a review of quality across our services and from this form a plan for the year ahead. This is owned and driven by our Quality Reference Group which is made up of PSS Staff, Shared Lives Carers and Service Users
PSS has achieved a huge amount in 2016 and we have captured this in our Annual Quality Report which can be found Here
Below we give an overview of what we achieved in 2015-2016 and so far in 2016-2017
Our Approach to Quality
Recent years have seen a number of new quality initiatives within PSS.
• The development of the Quality and Compliance Team
• The refresh of the PSS Quality Assurance Framework– Achieving Excellence which outlines our Quality Management Model and our 10 Quality Standards
• These PSS quality standards form the basis for quality reviews – a process which is used to help service managers reflect on the quality of their own delivery. They map across regulatory standards.
• Carrying out service user, Shared Lives carers, supporter and commissioner surveys
• The development of a new complaints system including the creation of an easy read complaints leaflet – designed with the help of our service users
• A review of current policies. This has involved reorganising policies, updating key policies and deleting policies that were not serving any purpose.
• A refresh of safeguarding and incident reporting practices within PSS to develop a best practice model, with simplified forms and procedures
• Further development of our Impact Reporting  processes
• Adding value and encouraging creative thinking by investing in Mindfulness and Coaching courses for our managers and senior support staff.
Our Plans for the future 
The Quality Reference Group and the Quality and Compliance Team have agreed the following objectives for 2017

To develop an Engagement Toolkit for PSS, giving practical advice, tools and templates on different ways to engage with staff and service users; with real case studies of ‘what works’ from across PSS 31st March 2017
To ensure that every service has a tailored ‘Quality Review’, taking into account the service they deliver and any published evidence-based quality standards on what works. The new process will also incorporate Health and Safety checklists, and sense checks of staff understanding of key policies and procedures (such as safeguarding and information governance) Ongoing
Develop a section of Dottie titled ‘Quality Resources’ which will have a library of tools and support for managers and staff 31st March 2017
By the end of the year, to have five sections of the ‘Quality Resource’ aligned with the CQC domains which will link to the inspection KLOE’s 31st December 2017
To work with Leadership Team and develop a plan for the next steps of Impact Reporting at PSS. 28th February 2017
To carry out a focused Medication Audit at Supported Living, Shared Lives and Day Centres venues, and report the findings to the Board of Trustees. 31st March 2017
To explore options for peer reviewing and involving expert by experience in quality processes. 30th May 2017
To build a network of quality leads across similar organisations to provide peer support. Ongoing
To carry out a focused refresh of PSS’s approach to the Mental Capacity Act and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards, following the Law Commissions review and draft Bill. Initial meeting in January 2017 Ongoing development in line with legislation.
To build relationships with other organisations who have achieved ‘Outstanding’ ratings in order to learn from best practice. Ongoing
To develop a PSS-wide approach to monitoring interactions with commissioners in response to the first commissioner survey results, which can then be reported quarterly to the Board of Trustees. 31st March 2017
To continue to refine the approach to the surveys, particularly the supporters surveys, to maximise the returns next year and ensure continued high scores. 31st July 2017

Where We Work



 
Where We Work
We like to describe ourselves as ‘multi-local’. This means we have a series of hubs across the UK that run alongside our central office in Liverpool. Our teams are made up of a Head Office team based in Liverpool and North West, Yorkshire, Midlands and Wales delivery teams.
Although our teams have a unique identity we all work closely together on cross-local projects including how we involve the people who use our services, how we consult our staff, how we campaign for the things we believe in and how we develop new ideas.
Our strong focus on togetherness as PSS people is vitally important in our success and this is further strengthened by the occasional intra-local bit of competition including and the naming of our new staff room (which Team Wales won with the cwtch!).

The Big Plan



 
The Big Plan
In the summer of 2015 PSS people were involved in sessions around our new Strategic (or as we’re now calling it ‘BIG’) plan. We spoke to many of our staff about what worked for them, what didn’t and what should be in the plan going forwards.
PSS previously had a plan that launched in 2012 and was designed to last for 3 years. This year (2015/16) we decided to extend it slightly, with a view to launching a refreshed version for 2016/17. The plan review project was delivered by Amy Lonton, one of our MA Social Work students and we believe this allowed the independence for everyone to share what they really thought about our existing plan. We got lots of fantastic information about what staff knew about the existing plan and what they didn’t, what they felt worked in the plan and what, in their opinion, needed to be added going forwards.
As a result of the many initial workshops and several with staff, management and service users since we have now got a really exciting plan for 2016 onwards. The Big Plan that will take us right up to 2019, our centenary year.

Specialist PND Training





Specialist PND Training
Specialist PND Training
Our Post Natal Depression Awareness Course aims to improve understanding and awareness of Perinatal Illness, including Antenatal and Post Natal Depression and Psychosis. During the course (which can be run over a full day or two half days) we discuss triggers and causes, symptoms, the impact on the family and the skills needed to aid recovery.
Our courses are delivered by experienced practitioners who are working with women and men with Perinatal Illness every day. They are there to share their personal experiences with the overall aim to raise awareness of and improve the support available to those who are experiencing such challenges.
The programme is made up of a variety of learning opportunities including 1:1 networking opportunities with our team, an insight into facts and myths about PND and there is also the time to get involved in practical activities working with case studies and put the theory into practice.
If you would like to attend one of our group courses, or arrange a special course for your team please use the contact details to the right. We’re always flexible to your needs and happy to discuss what you’re looking for. Please don’t hesitate to call our team if you need any more information.


Service Reviews

"Every frontline worker should attend this course. It was insightful, relevant and meaningful to me."

As I Care for a Parent





As I Care for a Parent
Young Carers
Our service provides support for children and young people aged 5 to 17 whose day to day lives are affected by caring for a family member who has a disability, chronic illness, mental ill health or problematic use of drugs and/or alcohol.
The experience of these young people can vary widely, from activities that disrupt their ability to have an ordinary childhood to them taking on extraordinary roles and responsibilities that would usually be undertaken by an adult.
Our support service provides young people with information about supporting their family member, a place for them to talk to other young carers, help with school life, hobbies and even guidance when applying for jobs. We know that it is important that these young people share their stories and seek advice on different areas of their life. We also think it’s vital that they have some time to enjoy themselves, have fun and just be young. We therefore run residential breaks wherever possible.
We also work closely with other agencies and services to raise awareness about the needs of Young Carers and to highlight the impact that caring can have on their development and life chances. By promoting the identification of Young Carers and supporting them, we help to ensure that these young people and their families are supported in planning for their futures as well as being signposted to other services that can help them.
What we believe
We believe young carers should have the chances that other young people take for granted, these might include:

Having time off from caring
Being given the choice not to be a carer
Getting the chance to enjoy the experience of growing up and do it in their own time
Enjoying time out with friends
Having some ‘me’ time
Talking to others about how they feel
Taking time to rest and enjoy themselves
Having time to complete school work
Getting together plans for their future
Having someone care for them

How do I access the service?
Whether you know of someone who identifies themselves as a young carer, or have come across someone who is unrecognised for what they’re doing, please contact us to find out more information about the support we can provide. Just use the details to the right and we can talk through what we do and how we can help. or you use our Referral form


Service Reviews

"PSS supported my boys in their role caring for their father. As well as supporting the boys emotionally, Young Carers also helps them relax and have fun. The street dance classes give them an important break and a chance to speak to PSS staff if they need to."

Peer group support for children where they can meet others who share their experience whilst having fun.
A support group for adults who have a loved one in prison.

Parents, including both the parent/carer and the prisoner parent post-release are welcome to join our Family Recovery Programme.

And to Turn My Life Around
Women’s Turnaround
Women’s turnaround is a service just for women and offers individual and group work to support adult female offenders and women at risk of offending in Liverpool and Knowsley.
Our team works with lots of different agencies, such as the Citizen’s Advice Bureau, drug and alcohol agencies, local training and employment agencies, mental health services and criminal justice services.
What’s our aim?
We are here to help reduce the number of women in prison who do not pose a risk to the public. We want to reduce offending and re-offending and increase the number of women diverted from prosecution. We also want to increase the number of women accessing and being successful in engaging with community provision. We also aim to reduce the number of family breakdowns and improve your health and well-being. We do all this to help not just you, but to support your wider family, helping them to reach the services they need.
What do we do?
We support women offenders and those at risk of offending, helping you to find the services you need, improve your well-being and make other life changes to make your future a positive one.
Our team are very experienced in working with women who have practical, personal, and emotional difficulties, so whatever your needs we can help. We offer individual support for all sorts of things including legal advice, advocacy, housing, benefit and debt management, employment, education and training, reading groups, health and well-being support drug and alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, reading, IT and counselling. We also run a number of group sessions which focus on thinking positively, freedom programme, parenting, critical thinking and understanding your emotions.
Our activities take place at our base at the Isis Centre Merseyside and in outreach venues throughout Liverpool, Knowsley, Sefton and St Helens.

Now I’ve Moved to the UK





Now I’ve Moved to the UK
Spinning World
Put simply, we work with people born outside the UK to help them recover from traumatic experiences. Our clients include refugees and asylum seekers all of whom have either directly experienced or witnessed human rights abuses.
Within Spinning World we have four specific services:

Spinning World (CAMHS): For young people who are asylum seekers, migrants and/or speak English as a second language.
UC24 Crisis Service: For newly arrived asylum seekers, providing up to 3 sessions of counselling.
Spinning World ALW (NHS): Based in Ashton, Leigh and Wigan this service sees migrants and refugees with complex trauma.

When are we open?
The Spinning World office is open Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm, but please note that we can (where needed) arrange some evening appointments. All sessions are by appointment so please make sure you call us before you attend.
But what if I don’t speak English?
We understand that for many of the people we work with English is not a familiar language. Therefore we work with a number of trusted and fully trained interpreters who, like our therapists ensure what they hear is kept confidential.
How do I know I can trust you?
All the services we provide are sensitive to differences in culture and difficulties with asylum and refugee status. They are also fully confidential and adhere to British Association of Psychotherapy professional standards.
Will I have to pay?
No all our services are free.
Where is the service based?
Our service is based in central Liverpool, but if you have problems with transportation or don’t know Liverpool very well please call us and we’ll try to find a solution with you.
 
1 Referral Form – CAMHS This service is available for children and young people under the age of 25 only.
1 Referral Form – ALW (2) This service is for asylum seekers and migrant communities living in the Ashton. Wigan and Leigh areas.

As a New or Expectant Parent





As a New or Expectant Parent
Parent & Baby Wellness
Postnatal Depression
Having a baby is meant to be a happy time, but for a lot of parents, this just isn’t the case. Post Natal Depression (or PND) can sometimes be the cause of this and the scary thing is, it can happen to anyone. PND has lots of symptoms, these can be physical such as headaches or feeling tired all the time or emotional ones like feeling inadequate, having little interest in your baby, feeling guilty, over concern for your baby or feeling irritable. Many people feel the need to stay silent and often this only makes things worse.
What do we do?
Our PND service principally provides support by visiting the homes of anyone who is struggling with the symptoms of PND. Here one of our specialist practitioners assesses need and offers tailor-made support, this can include advice, enhanced listening support (both emotional and  practical) and/or signposting to other services that could be of help. We recognise that PND doesn’t just affect new mothers, so we can offer support to other members of the family too.
If one to one at home isn’t right for an individual we also offer drop in clinics and group work sessions at various venues and Children’s Centres around Liverpool. This offers a space for individuals to share and learn about PND while qualified Group Workers help them to learn to relax and build up confidence at their own pace.
What if I don’t feel ready?
We appreciate not everyone wants to meet face to face, many individuals fear admitting how they really feel in case people judge them and they ask themselves questions such as: Am I really depressed? Should I tell my GP? Will I always feel like this? Therefore we have setup a Facebook support service. These ‘remote’ services provide online forums, FAQs and the recovery stories of others and offer a place to learn more and take the first step on the road to recovery.
LivPIP
 
So what is LivPIP?
LivPIP aims to help parents and other primary caregivers to understand and develop the relationship they have with their baby. The service works with families both ante-natally and post-natally. This means that beyond our original PND provision we can now provide a fully rounded peri-natal support service for families living in Liverpool, working from conception to the age of two.
The vision of our funders at PIP UK is ‘a society of emotionally secure children who grow up to become socially responsible adults’. To do this PIP UK and Liverpool CCG fund psychotherapeutic support services, like ours, and ensure these are made available to families who are struggling to form a secure relationship with their baby. We work with parents who are distressed, anxious, fearful and generally finding it difficult to build a bond; helping them to increase their understanding of how to read and respond to their baby’s needs and therefore are also struggling to build a strong attachment.
How will LivPIP support Parents?
After a full assessment parents can be offered;
One to one parent infant therapy:  Mellow bumps group, Mellow babies group, Watch wait wonder group, KIPS (using film to support healthy interaction)
All therapy is tailored to the whole family’s needs and we work with antenatal parents as well as post natal.
How will LivPIP support professionals?
Our main focus is on helping parents to gain a greater insight into their own approach to parenting and how this affects the relationship and bond they have with their baby.
Our overarching aim is to promote positive parent infant psychotherapy as a critical element of early years intervention. We aim to do this by providing both direct support services to which other professionals can refer in addition to relevant training for professionals from across the city.
LivPIP also works in partnership with children’s centres, family and children’s services, health visitors and midwives and we accept referrals from all of these professionals, as well as self referral.
 


Service Reviews

"The Post Natal Depression service has helped me more than I could have every imagined. It’s been amazing to meet other mums going through similar things at the groups. Every day I feel like I’m getting closer and closer to being me again."

Who Have Disabilities Too
Community Support
We started the ‘Enable’ service over twenty years ago after recognising that there was a shortage of services to support people with learning, physical and mental health difficulties when out in their local community. Today the service is known as ‘Community Support’.
Spending time in the community and having a social life is hugely important for everyone. It enables the development of both life skills and confidence and overall this improves quality of life.
The support we provide can range from a few hours a week to full-time support. We support people to live as independently as possible whilst ensuring that their dignity is at the forefront of every plan and activity. We ensure this by fully taking into account the hopes, wishes and interests of the people who wish to use our service as well as their individual gender, age and cultural needs.
Our service is staffed by Support Workers who are matched by experience, personality and interests with the individuals they support. They recieve regular training and supervision and are focused on working closely with families, carers and other agencies as appropriate.
What are our aims?
Our service aims to enable people to achieve a higher standard of living and to enjoy their life to the full. This is achieved by focusing on, encouraging and facilitating; learning, education & employment, budgeting, the development of social skills, personal travel, the building of self confidence, the provision of information and advice, access to health & welfare services and the development of life skills.
Who can use Community Support?
Enable can be used by anyone over the age of 16 who has a diagnosed physical or learning disability, acquired brain injury, sensory impairment or a mental health problem.
Enable can be purchased through Local Authorities, the NHS, personal budgets, direct payments or privately by an individual or someone acting on their behalf.
Our service can be accessed through a referral from a social worker or another professional, or individuals can refer themselves. Just contact our team using the details to the right.

Trio
We run a service called ‘Trio’ which offers a unique model of support for people with dementia. Unlike conventional 1:1 or group support services Trio works with one carer and two service users allowing more opportunities to meet others in the local area with similar interests and make friends through social interaction facilitated by one of our care team.
Trio is provided by trained Adult Placement Carers who deliver a flexible service in which carers and their families can receive a valuable break from their caring role and users of the service can be supported to remain independent.

"Trio allows my mum to do the things she enjoys with her friends whilst I take some time for myself"

As I Move into Adult’s Services





As I Move into Adult’s Services
Transitions
Our Transitions service was developed to promote and setup services for young people aged between 16 and 18 years who have left care. In the majority of cases this involves recruiting a Shared Lives or Adult Placement carer whose primary focus is on developing independence and life skills in the young person they work with.
What is Shared Lives?
Shared Lives is a form of support where individuals over 16 live at home with a specially recruited and trained carer and their family. The service runs in a similar way to a Foster placement, but this service is specifically designed for adults and young people.
Our service is fully focused around choice and independence. We encourage each individual to get involved in the decision of where they live and plan our matches carefully, so that both the carer and person using the service feel happy before the arrangement is made.
At PSS we manage the service from the start, we recruit and train carers, we gain a strong understanding of the needs of those wishing to use the service and alongside those involved we match the two together. We offer a programme of training and support for our carers, which helps maintain high levels of support and most importantly we are there 24/7 to help our carers along the way.
Who can use the Shared Lives Transitions?
This service provides support for young people people who cannot, at the time they start using our service, support themselves fully. They may have a learning or physical disability, a mental health problem or emotional and behavioural difficulties. The age range of our service users goes from 16 to 25.
What are the benefits over other forms of care?
Shared Lives Transitions is truly unique because it allows young people who may not be fully able to live on their own the chance to experience independence. These individuals can live in a safe environment, which PSS has approved and with carers who are trained to deal with their individual needs. Because each carer family is different and each user of our services is too, we can truly ensure we plan for each individual. No one size fits all and no two families are the same.
Aside from the personal advantages of this service, in terms of providing a family environment, safety, support and independence, Shared Lives or Adult Placement has significant cost savings for each individual. It is estimated that being part of the service can save at least £13,000 per annum per person in comparison to residential care and supported living and in some areas this figure is much higher.

Where I Can Enjoy a Break





Where I Can Enjoy a Break
Short Breaks
Caring for another person can be hard work and taking a break is really important. Having time for yourself doesn’t just apply to carers but also to the person begin cared for. Sometimes it’s just nice to have a change of scenery and see different faces. Our support team offer short breaks for people with learning and physical disabilities, mental health needs and/or other complex needs. Whether you’re looking for a break with a trained and experienced ‘Shared Lives’ family or for a break with other people living in a supported living service, we have lots of options across Merseyside, the Midlands and North Wales.
Shared Lives Short Breaks
Our Shared Lives Short Breaks are delivered across Merseyside, the Midlands, and North Wales offer vulnerable adults a few days in the company of one of our trained and carefully recruited Shared Lives Carers. If you haven’t come across Shared Lives just click here to find out more. We like to share our Shared Lives Short Breaks stories, to see the story of Chris and Claire who live in Staffordshire view the video at the bottom of the page.
Supported Living Short Breaks
We have a number of Supported Living services across Merseyside where we can offer breaks to adults with additional needs. Based across the city of Liverpool our services all have strong teams of support staff who spend their time shaping the care they provide around each person who visits us. If you want to make an enquiry about a Supported Living Short Breaks just contact Jordan Smith to find out more, click here for Jordan’s details.

Where I Get Support in My Own Home
Supported Living
Our care and support services enable people who need additional help to live independently in their own home. We offer a wide range of housing with care and/or support to meet an individual’s personal needs and maximize their independence.
We support many types of people including those with learning or physical disabilities, mental health needs, older people, people with substance misuse needs and young people.
We provide both self-contained and shared housing. Some staff are based within services and some provide visiting support. For those with more significant care needs we also provide a number of small registered care homes. We can also provide personal care or visiting support to people who already have their own homes, but who need some extra help. Our services are registered with CQC which gives those who use our service and their families additional confidence in the quality of our personal care. We are also accredited with each of the local authorities we work in.
What type of care and support do we provide?
Everyone we work with has their own personalised support plan, which has been designed with them. Our team provides any support that promotes independent living, health and wellbeing including:

Assistance with learning independent living skills
Advice and assistance with claiming welfare benefits and Housing Benefit
Advice and assistance with budgeting and managing bills
Support to access health and social care services
Help to access employment, training or volunteering
Support to develop links within the community and develop social networks
Emotional support
Personal care for those that need it

Who can use our services?
Our services are available to anyone aged 18 and over. We can accept referrals from a range of agencies and individuals who can refer themselves or a member of their family.
Some people will have their care or support partly or fully funded by a statutorybody; others may have to pay for the service themselves.
To get further information, please contact our team using the details to the right for an informal chat. We are always here to answer any questions you might have.

Where I Live with My Carer





Where I Live with My Carer
Shared Lives
Shared Lives (or Adult Placement as it is also known) is a form of support where vulnerable adults and young people over 16 live at home with a specially recruited and trained carer and their family. The service runs in a similar way to a Foster placement, but this service is specifically designed for adults and young people.
Our service is fully focused around choice and independence. We encourage each individual to get involved in the decision of where they live and plan our matches carefully, so that both the carer and person using the service feel happy before the arrangement is made.
PSS formed the first service of its kind in Liverpool over 30 years ago but today it is nationwide and run by many different organisations. For us the service has shown real results, creating positive lifestyles for vulnerable adults and it now provides nearly one fifth of support for adults with a learning disability in the UK.
We currently Shared Lives services in Liverpool, St Helens, Knowsley, the Wirral, North Wales, Staffordshire, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Manchester.
At PSS we manage the service from the start, we recruit and train carers, we gain a strong understanding of the needs of those wishing to use the service and alongside those involved we match the two together. We offer a programme of training and support for our carers, which helps maintain high levels of support and most importantly we are there 24/7 to help our carers along the way. Find out more about becoming a carer here.
Who can use the Shared Lives or Adult Placement service?
This service provides support for people who cannot, at the time they start using our service, support themselves fully. They may have a learning or physical disability, a mental health problem or they may have recently left the more formal care system. The age range of our service users goes from 16 and there is no age limit, so we really do provide a service for all levels of need and all stages of life.
What are the benefits over other forms of care?
Shared Lives or Adult Placement is truly unique because it allows individuals who may not be fully able to live on their own the chance to experience independence. These individuals can live in a safe environment, which PSS has approved and with carers who are trained to deal with their individual needs. Because each carer family is different and each user of our services is too, we can truly ensure we plan for each individual. No one size fits all and no two families are the same.
Aside from the personal advantages of this service, in terms of providing a family environment, safety, support and independence, Shared Lives or Adult Placement has significant cost savings for each individual. It is estimated that being part of the service can save at least £13,000 per annum per person in comparison to residential care and supported living and in some areas this figure is much higher.

Who We Are







The Big Plan
As a result of the many initial workshops we have now got a really exciting plan for 2016 onwards. The Big Plan that will take us right up to 2019, our centenary year.







Our History
In 2019 our organisation will celebrate its 100th birthday, but even as the years mount up one thing’s for sure, we’re not slowing with age.







Our Values
We're a values led organisation, some of us even wear our values on our sleeve.  







Where We Work
We’re a multi-local organisation, that means we work around several hubs across the UK. We follow where the need takes us and this map shows where we are currently operating.







We Go Further
We don’t think its enough just to provide good services, we want our quality of delivery to be exceptional and we want to have the results to prove this.








Our Team
Our values based recruitment process means that we have a team we’re very proud of. We’d like to introduce our Trustees, Leadership team and Senior Management team here.







Tell Us
We need to know where our teams are doing things really well, but also where things aren’t being delivered to our own high standards. If you’ve got thoughts about our services, we’d really like you to share them.
