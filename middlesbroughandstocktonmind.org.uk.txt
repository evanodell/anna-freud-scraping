How Blogging changed my life
For a decade now, I have had to deal with some things that I didn't handle well at all.Amongst other things, I was getting bullied at secondary school and at home and for someone who was in their early teens, growing up, meeting new people, finding out and trying new things etc, all I was doing was hurting.I was… Continue readingFor a decade now, I have had to deal with some things that I didn't handle well at all.Amongst other things, I was getting bullied at secondary school and at home and for someone who was in their early teens, growing up, meeting new people, finding out and trying new things etc, all I was doing was hurting.I was hurting inside whilst I was happy on the outside. I was turning to food to give me comfort and this in turn gave me a certain low level of happiness but some ease none the less.But I had no real sense of happiness anymore. I was absolutely, completely and utterly lost.To make it even worse, I didn't tell anyone about the bullying and about how I was feeling and even now that is my biggest mistake and regret I have made. It caused me to have really bad anxiety that meant I couldn't leave the house because I was so self conscious of what people would say, get paranoid and all of my emotions got out of hand and I couldn't deal with it.I was a really negative girl in what I thought was a really negative world.But oh, how I was wrong.Over the past couple of years, I am at the point where I am slowly but surely accepting myself, flaws and all, and becoming hopefully a much happier person.This is mainly due to finding a passion in blogging.It has given me a sense of guidance in a way, where I am finding out things about myself that I would have hidden five years ago and a platform where I can be myself whilst letting go of all the anger and negativity. Most importantly, blogging has taught me how to talk about things and how to get pass that fear of being judged. It has taught me that it is ok not to be ok.If you start blogging or just opening up more to people, do it. Have a talk with them. Scream, cry (god knows how many times I have cried when writing a blog post). Or put your feelings into words onto an online space. I have finally realised that there are people who will support you and look after you no matter what you are feeling and thinking.Mental health affects more people than you probably think. You aren't alone in this, you never have and you never will be. This is why it is so important to do something I didn't do, start talking about it.nobody should face a mental health problem alone, and we want to be there *every* day, for anyone who needs us. This day recognises what support there is out there for people, but most importantly for people to be mindful every day!Submitted by: Caroline

Get Set To Go











The Get Set to Go programme aims to improve the quality of life of anyone with a mental health problem through access to sport and physical activity in the local community.
With support from Sport England and the National Lottery, this national programme seeks to help overcome the barriers someone with a mental health issue may face when wanting to become more physically active.
Participating in sport and physical activity is associated with the following benefits: 

Improved mental health and wellbeing
Reduction in stress, anxiety and depression
Improved confidence, motivation and self-esteem
Weight loss
Improved social life, meeting new people and having some fun!

There really is something for everyone, from yoga to netball, ice skating, boxing – and lots more. 


                                    Who is this service for?
We work with people who:

Want to use physical activity and sport as a means of improving their mental health and wellbeing.
Find starting something new difficult.
Don't have the motivation or confidence to participate.
Don't know what's available or how to access it.
May need someone to support them to attend.

You can contact us yourself or ask a professional who could also refer you.
Following referral we’ll help you decide what sport or activity could work for you, some may be sports that you have previously done, while others may be completely new. We will also help you find something that fits into your schedule and if you would like to do something on your own or with others.
You could also receive support from a Volunteer Peer Navigator who will help you to access sport and leisure facilities. We put on taster sessions very frequently with help from sports providers so you can try different things. There is such a broad range of sports to choose from!

Getting outside in the fresh air for a run helps me to clear my head, release the stress of the day, gives me a sense of purpose and achievement, reduces my anxiety levels and boosts my mood.  When I run I feel free. Anyone can run, it doesn't matter what age, size or shape you are.  All you need is a pair of trainers.  I would recommend it to anyone for its benefits on mental health.Submitted by: Lizzie

Side by Side - Peer Support Hub










Funded by the Big Lottery, Mind have set up a Peer Support Hub across Middlesbrough and Stockton, providing opportunities to promote peer support and share knowledge, experience and good practice between existing groups and organisations.
Hub activities include:

Peer Support Hub Networking Events
Expert on Call Sessions
Engagement and sharing good practice with local groups and organisations
Advice and support for peer supporters
Regular newsletters and e-bulletins

Side by Side have created a great range of peer support groups in the community from arts and crafts to fitness. 
Each member of the peer support group have lived experiences of mental health difficulties, therefore peers can support each other through relating to others and sharing their advice and guidance. 
Peer support groups include:

Raindrops to Rainbows - the leading North East Perinatal Mental Health peer support for mums
Swift-tees - Improving mental health through running

We have recently produced a video to highlight the work the project does for people around Middlesbrough and Stockton. You can view it here.


                                    Who is this service for?
If you are an individual, or part of an organisation, with lived experience of mental health difficulties or mental health illness supporting others in their recovery, the peer support hub can connect you with other peer supporters, where you can share experiences around the setting up, facilitation and promoting of groups, influencing Peer Support locally whilst contributing to Peer Support nationally.


                                    How can I access this service?

Children and Young People’s support










Stress, worries and pressures at school can have a huge impact on your life. We’re here to help. We can offer you emotional support if you are attending any school in Middlesbrough.
Research has told us that on average 3 pupils per classroom are affected by such issues, however statistics reveal that as many as 2 in every 5 children in Middlesbrough suffer from poor emotional health and well-being, which is higher than the national average.
Emotional support
If you attend a primary or secondary school in Middlesbrough, we can offer you one-to-one sessions as well as group work. Our work is aimed at young people at risk of emotional or mental health difficulties and those with existing mild to moderate difficulties.
Group work is flexible according to the needs of the young people and the school, but mainly focuses on raising awareness of emotional well-being, building resilience and teaching coping strategies, including working on issues such as confidence and self-esteem, stress, anxiety, low mood and anger.
Emotional support is offered depending on the needs and wishes of the young person. If you feel you could benefit from having someone trusted to talk to then we can offer you the right support.
We can help with:
• Not feeling good about yourself• Feeling anxious and worrying• Feeling sad or depressed• Difficulties with relationships and friendships• Struggling to concentrate• Feeling overwhelmed with emotions
Transition
One of the main issues we work with is young people moving from primary to secondary school. We understand how overwhelming it can be adjusting to a new school and making new friendships. We can help you prepare for this exciting new change in a number of ways such as group focused activities and one-to-one sessions. 
As well as working through term time, we also offer opportunities in school holidays where young people can mix with other children, learn new skills and expressing how they feel. 
If you need any more support for your family, please look at Family Information Service Middlesbrough which provides information and advice about the services for families in Middlesbrough.


                                    Who is this service for?
We can work with you if you are under 16 and are attending a school in Middlesbrough.

Diversion and Resettlement










We recognise that some people who become involved in the criminal justice system may need extra support, especially if they have a mental health issue or other vulnerabilities.
We offer a rapid response service to meeting individual needs and provide planned support to people who access our service.
We can also assist you in the communication process within the police station and/ or in courts.


                                    Who is this service for?
We can support you in custody, at court, on release from prison and in the community if you are having difficulty with:

Money matters
Housing
Attending appointments
Looking after yourself
Accessing mental or other health services
Drug / alcohol issues
Relationships and social isolation



                                    How can I access this service?

If you are
                                            
                                                Age 18 to 49,

                                                Stockton-on-Tees,
you can access this service by
                                

Telephone:

Email:
info@middlesbroughandstocktonmind.org.uk



                                    What happens next?
Once we receive a referral, we try to make contact with you within 5 working days to arrange an appointment to meet with you to understand your situation and listen to you. This can be at the Mind Centre, at your home or elsewhere in the community. We will then identify your needs and agree a plan of action for you. The length of time in the service depends entirely on you, but we often find that this on average is between 3 and 6 months. After your support within the Criminal Justice System has finished, we will help you to access other services within Mind or with other organisations.

Carers and Families Wellbeing Service










We think carers do amazing work every day in Middlesbrough for the people they care for and we’re here to support you.
We want to give you an opportunity to talk about your concerns and problems and give you some space to focus on yourself rather than the person you care for. Caring for someone with mental health difficulties can bring unique challenges.
We understand this and give you the right support and advice to help you in the important role you play in that person’s life.
We can offer you:

one to one emotional support
carers support plans
support at meetings
information and advice
support groups and wellbeing workshops



                                    Who is this service for?
We can work with you if:
• You are aged 18 or over• You or the person you care for lives in Middlesbrough• You are a relative, partner or friend of an adult with mental health difficulties

People with mental health struggless believe that sharing their stories can provide invaluable support to others.

Improve your communication skills
Inspire others by sharing your life experiences
Make friends with similar interests
Improve your mental health and wellbeing
Provide you with useful information that can help you set up your own group

The free accredited training is five hours a week for eight weeks.
Upon completing this training programme, you can go on to assist in the facilitation of the courses run by Connect Recovery College. Or you may choose to set up your own community group. 


                                    Who is this service for?

Made a lot of new friends
I feel secure and now I love meeting people - I made a lot of friends through Mind! I think it's important people feel involved in how the service is ran. For me, the most important part is being able to socialise and learn new social skills in a secure, friendly environment.

Macmillan Mental Health Cancer Care Research











Macmillan has funded a brand new research project in Middlesbrough and Stockton aiming to improve the experiences for people living with mental health problems who are also affected by cancer. This is the first project of its kind in the country and we want you to get involved and help us make a difference. 

Do you have a mental health problem and are you also affected by cancer? Are you looking after someone in these circumstances?
We're interested in hearing about your experience of accessing cancer screening, diagnostic, treatment or aftercare services. 
Tell us your story:
No matter where you, or your loved one are on your cancer journey, we would like to hear: 

What you think worked well or not so well
If you got the right type of support at every stage 
Your thoughts, ideas and suggestions on how your experience could have been better. 

With your support, we want to ensure that people with mental health problems have the same access to cancer services as everyone else. 
If you're interested, there is also an opportunity to become a member of the Macmillan Mental Health Cancer Care Research Steering group which will support the sucessful delivery of the project.
To find out more about and how you can get involved, please get in touch.
Please note this is a research project, not a counselling service. If you require support for any emotional difficulties please contact Open Mind Therapies. For more information on cancer and support, visit Macmillan website here.

Appropriate Adult










Our service is here to support people that are vulnerable due to mental health problems or learning difficulties, and detained in police custody. The service is highly recognised by criminal justice agencies, and is led by a team of trained and committed volunteers.
Who can have an Appropriate Adult?
Police custody processing can be distressing, especially for a person who has difficulties due to other vulnerabilities. If a person is deemed vulnerable, the police will request for an independent third party to attend and support their welfare.
If you, or someone you know needs support during custody procedures when arrested, you can make a referral by ringing 01642 257 020. You do not need to have a diagnosed condition to access support, and police may make a referral if they suspect a vulnerability.
What does an Appropriate Adult do?
An Appropriate Adult is present for custody processes, to support the vulnerable person at a very difficult time. When a person with a vulnerability is arrested, an Appropriate Adult will be notified to attend the police station. This may be a family member, friend, social services, or a Mind volunteer.
The Appropriate Adult will assist the detained person with:
- Their welfare needs- Support for fair and comfortable questioning- Support during police interviews to facilitate communication- Understanding rights and entitlements during detention
Do you want to be an Appropriate Adult?
Join our passionate team of volunteers, to support vulnerable people in police custody. As a Mind Appropriate Adult volunteer, you would receive role specific training and support to comfortably carry out the role. For more information on how to apply, click onto the Volunteering section here. To find out more about Appropriate Adults, visit the National Appropriate Adult Network page.


                                    Who is this service for?

People over the age of 18
People who live in any of the four local authorities
People who are experiencing mental health difficulties and/or learning difficulties
People who are in police custody

Please note no formal diagnosis is needed to have an appropriate adult.
For more information on mental health and the police, visit Mind.


                                    How can I access this service?

                                    What happens next?
When you contact Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind to make a referral, we will confirm if someone can attend for the requested time. Once the appointment is confirmed, an Appropriate Adult will meet you, or the person you are making the referral for, at the specified location, i.e. police station.

Voices for Choices










Voices for Choices is currently supported by Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind. It is an independent group that empowers people with lived experience of mental distress in Middlesbrough and Redcar & Cleveland.
Making Sure Local Services Listen to You
Voices for Choices has already helped run a number of events to get the views of people with lived experience of mental health problems in the local area. We also have good links with local services and commissioners. As a result we are able to pass this information onto them and make a difference.
We are always keen for new people to get involved as much or as little as they want.
Getting involved in Voices for Choices is a way for you to:
• Share your experiences• Find out what is happening locally• Raise awareness of the issues affecting service users and carers• Contribute to the improvement of mental health services and support• Meet others with similar interests
Voices for Choices are funded by South Tees Clinical Commissioning Group, part of the local NHS and are made up of a strategic group and a forum.
Giving you a Strong Voice in Decisions
The Strategic Group is made up of service users, carers and key partners. They are responsible for deciding what Voices for Choices does, putting this into action and making sure that everything goes smoothly. The work ensures that the views of services users are heard and are listened to. This service also tries to get a voice on official groups when services are being changed and improved. People on this group get together regularly and also do work between meetings. Up to 12 people can be on this group. 
A Chance to Share Experiences
The Forum gives you the chance to share your views and get your voice heard. You don’t have to come to every meeting, just the ones that you want to. It meets four times a year for a couple of hours each time. The people taking part suggest what topics future meetings should look at. You don’t have to do any work in between meetings.
We can pay for your fares or petrol to get to our events up to a reasonable amount.
If you want to get involved in the forum, we can help you find training and support if you need it. As well as this we can help you take part in other activities to influence and improve services.


                                    Who is this service for?
You can join the Voices for Choices forum if you are:

FROM PANIC ATTACKS, AGORAPHOBIA AND ANXIETY TO RUNNING FOR MIND IN LONDON
In this post, I’m going to share a concise version of my mental health story to illustrate how it is possible to achieve things which you can’t even imagine when you’re going through the excruciating lows of your mental health conditions.Let’s first rewind 10 years to 29th May 2007. I’m 15 years old and, although I… Continue readingIn this post, I’m going to share a concise version of my mental health story to illustrate how it is possible to achieve things which you can’t even imagine when you’re going through the excruciating lows of your mental health conditions.Let’s first rewind 10 years to 29th May 2007. I’m 15 years old and, although I don’t know it yet, mental health conditions including panic attacks, agoraphobia, anxiety and depression are going to have a massive impact on my life.At that time, I had no real concept of mental health other than the stigmatised version which is prevalent in society. So when I began having panic attacks I didn’t understand what was happening to me.Panic attacks made me feel detached from myself and reality. They made me feel like I was going completely mad; like I was inevitably going to be put in to a mental health facility and locked away forever.So, at that time, with my lack of understanding and these scary thoughts in mind, it is no wonder that I developed agoraphobia because of my panic attacks.The thought of having a panic attack terrified me. The thought of having a panic attack in a public place absolutely terrified me. Therefore, my strategy for coping was to try and stay at home for as much time as I could. That way, if I had another panic, lost control and went mad at least I’d be on my own and nobody would judge me.I avoided family events, making plans with friends and even situations as simple to others as going for a short walk with my family.It wasn’t just that I avoided these things though, I have cried uncontrollably and begged my family not to make me go out with them before because of how scared I was.Even though I was able to overcome my panic attacks and agoraphobia over 5 years ago now, I have experienced several recurring bouts of severe anxiety and depression since then.The most recent of these bouts was between Autumn 2015 and Spring 2016. My anxiety completely overtook me and caused me to endlessly obsess over thoughts and questions which have no answer. It was exhausting and debilitating.During this period, like each of the several times I’ve experienced severe anxiety, I became depressed due to my conditions I withdrew myself from the world. If not always physically, then certainly mentally.In my mind, the way in which I withdraw myself during times in which I’m going through anxiety and depression is different from the agoraphobia which I used to experience.I find that it is not a fear in the same way as my agoraphobia was but ultimately it has the same consequence. I become isolated and just going out to do daily tasks like go to work or go shopping are suddenly mountains to climb.Even if I’m able to achieve something in this state. It will have been a constant struggle and I will not have been able to enjoy it.It is difficult to explain such complex conditions and emotions in a blog post and ultimately I don’t think I can ever get across the amount of fear, hurt and helplessness that I’ve experienced because of my mental health.Hopefully though I’ve got across just how isolated I’ve been at several points during the last decade and how consigned I was to the fact that I’d always be like that.This should put into sharp focus for you how unbelievably massive and farfetched it would’ve seemed for me, even 18 months ago, to go to central London, take part in an event with around 15,000 people and actually enjoy the entire experience!On top of that, in order to even start my fundraising I had to actually tell people about my conditions and be open about my mental health!I would never ever have felt able to do any of that a few years ago. I would have been far too scared of what people would think of me to speak out.Regardless of that, I wouldn’t have been able to go to an event like the Vitality London 10k without having to constantly reassure myself in my head that I would be okay; if I was even able to go at all.Yet, here I am in a position where over the last year or so I finally can do what I want to do.I now want to tell everyone about my mental health conditions to eliminate stigma and help others.I now enjoy and revel in doing things and living life fully because after years and years of trying I have learnt to manage my conditions positively and I very rarely experience anxious thoughts anymore.I feel motivated and passionate, I want to achieve things in my life and I want to make a difference to others because I know how tough mental health can be.Fundraising, blogging, YouTube, volunteering and campaigning all give me a platform to try and make that difference.Bizarrely, and unbelievably to the 15 year old me, I’m happy that mental health is still a big part of my life because it is in such a positive way now!As I’ve said before, I’m not naïve enough to think that I’m invincible to mental health conditions now. I still take anti-depressants and I know there is a chance that my mental health could become worse again in the future.However, I know that I am so well equipped to manage my mental health now that I would overcome the tough times again. Besides, I know now that it is nothing to be ashamed of to not be okay and that acceptance that I, like everyone else, am human and vulnerable to it means I feel at peace with it all.Whatever happens to me over the rest of my lifetime will happen. However, I know now from personal experience that it is possible to go from extreme lows to massive highs and achieve things which I never thought I could.That inspires me and I hope it inspires you too.RobSubmitted by: Rob

My experience with Mind
When I first came to Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, I had lost all my confidence and found it hard to talk to people. I was suffering with severe depression and had been under the care of my local crisis intervention team at Roseberry park. I was introduced to the connect recovery college and took part in a few of the… Continue readingWhen I first came to Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, I had lost all my confidence and found it hard to talk to people. I was suffering with severe depression and had been under the care of my local crisis intervention team at Roseberry park. I was introduced to the connect recovery college and took part in a few of the courses. This really helped and soon I found my confidence starting to return. Meeting other people on the courses who also had their own personnel experiences with mental health issues and realising I wasn’t alone was a massive help to me. After around two years my confidence had returned and I enrolled with the open university and started to study for my degree in English Literature and Creative Writing, and I also decided that I wanted to give something back to Mind, and the only thing I could give was my time, so I became a volunteer. Helping other people and listening to others talk about their own experiences, also helped me in my own recovery. Getting out of the house more often and going to different places to co-facilitate on connect recovery courses has been great for my own wellbeing. Now, after 4 years as both a service user and a volunteer, the time has come for me to move on. My confidence is back and I now feel like I have the tools to be able to manage when things start to go bad. I am now about to start a new job for the first time in 4 years and I am also waiting to start my third year at university, two things I could not have imagined when I first walked through the doors of Mind. I cannot thank the staff, volunteers and others I have met along the way enough. The service at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind is second to none and I would not hesitate to point someone in the direction of Mind if they need that help. Keep up the excellent work and my many, many thanks,Submitted by: Paul

Why I decided to volunteer
For those of you who may not be aware, June 1st-7th is National Volunteers' Week in the UK. This is an event set up specifically with the aim of celebrating the achievements of those who volunteer, raising the profiles of the organisations who need volunteers, and encouraging those who have never volunteered before to… Continue readingFor those of you who may not be aware, June 1st-7th is National Volunteers' Week in the UK. This is an event set up specifically with the aim of celebrating the achievements of those who volunteer, raising the profiles of the organisations who need volunteers, and encouraging those who have never volunteered before to give it a try. Volunteering is something I had always wanted to do, but with school, college, and then university taking up so much time- not to mention my anxiety disorder making new experiences incredibly frightening for me- I always avoided the chance to get involved. However, after finishing my Master's degree I found I had a lot of free time. After admitting that my anxiety made it difficult for me to try new things, Mind was suggested. Being somebody who suffers from mental illness, I'd obviously heard of it, and I knew of its reputation as a great place for support. So, I bit the bullet, researched opportunities, and soon enquired about joining their anti-stigma group. As the title suggests, this is a group with my local Mind branch that meets regularly to discuss and implement ways of reducing the stigma around mental health. This includes encouraging more people to open up, reaching out to employers, and getting involved with local and nationwide events relating to mental illness. I was terrified before attending my first meeting. Would I have to speak? What if I embarrassed myself by saying something stupid? How would I manage in a room full of people I'd never met before? Thankfully there was nothing to worry about. Not only was everybody welcoming, but there was no pressure to talk if you were too nervous to do so. It was a great experience, and one of the few things I do that I actually look forward to, instead of dread for days beforehand.So, now I'm a volunteer, here is why I love volunteering, and some tips so you can get involved too!1.	Look into organisations that relate to things you care about. Obviously every charity works towards a worthwhile cause, but I find that I'm much more invested when what I'm working on relates to my own experiences. This means I can generate ideas based on things I've actually gone through myself, and I can connect with the other volunteers much easier because we all understand what it's like to suffer from mental illness. I've already met some great people, all inspiring in their own ways, who suffer from similar things, and so are easier to talk to about certain topics.2.	Volunteering is a great way to build up your own confidence and self-esteem. There are so many chances to get involved, and you can do as much or as little as you want. When I first got involved I promised myself that I would force myself out of my comfort zone, and say yes to things I would normally shy away from. Just a couple of weeks ago I sat with the group while being filmed by Tyne Tees News, and a few days ago I sat (on my own!) in front of a camera and talked about why I enjoy volunteering so much.3.	Opportunities like those in the above point are great to put on your CV and applications! It shows that you care about causes and issues, and that you can get involved with things of your own volition, and not just because of the paycheck at the end of the month. It can boost your career, and give you some fantastic skills depending on the opportunities available. There are often chances to gain extra qualifications and certifications, which can also enhance your CV and really make you stand out from the crowd. 4.	You meet fantastic people. If you volunteer for something that relates to your own experience, you'll soon have validation of your feelings, because you'll be surrounded by those who have gone through the same thing. 5.	There is no pressure. Obviously it's wonderful if you can be available for everything, but this isn't always possible. There is complete understanding that sometimes things come up, and that's okay! 6.	You can make a difference. Stigma is still a really significant issue in the conversations around mental health, and to know that we're helping to break down those walls, and correct any misconceptions that people have about speaking out, is a fantastic feeling. No matter which charity or organisation you choose, you will always be making a difference to somebody!So if you have some spare time now that summer is finally getting underway, take some time to research the groups and organisations in your local area. They're always looking for more volunteers, and you'll have a fantastic time while gaining invaluable experience. Give it a try!Submitted by: Iona

Running For My Life
Mental Health has been part of my life since I was a little girl. To be honest, probably since the day I was born. My father was an addict. Alcohol being his drug of choice, forcing my family to break up when I was only 3 years old. His love for alcohol was just too strong. It overtook the love for his wife and children.… Continue readingMental Health has been part of my life since I was a little girl. To be honest, probably since the day I was born. My father was an addict. Alcohol being his drug of choice, forcing my family to break up when I was only 3 years old. His love for alcohol was just too strong. It overtook the love for his wife and children. Alongside this, my Mam has suffered from a very severe level of depression for much of my life. She has only really started to come out the other side over the last 10 years, although as anyone who knows about mental ill health or who suffers themselves, it is always a burden you will carry.My own experiences started officially after the birth of my daughter when I was 19 years old. To be fair, they probably started a lot earlier but there was no space in my head to entertain the thought and mental health was simply not discussed when I was young. My best friend didn't even know how bad my home life was. It was like you became a leper if you came from a broken home as it was, you just didn't add to these issues by admitting your parents were clearly ill. Being a victim of bullying for being poor was enough, I could not have added my family life situation to the mix.After an initial bout of severe depression which saw me signed off and put on medication about 10 year ago, after the death of my Nana, I have been able to pretty much self manage since. Or so I thought. Back in March 2017 I realised I had hit complete rock bottom. It was a rainy day and I was coming back from taking my daughter to her Dads. The roads were slippy and I skidded on some surface water. I took my hands off the wheel, hoping I would crash. If it wasn't for me spotting a photo of my son in the corner of my windscreen and snapping to my senses, well you know what the result would have been. And I just simply did not care. That photo saved my life! First thing Monday morning I called my Doctor and I have been off work, put on medication again which I fully intend to stick to and I am seeing a counsellor.I truly believe that if it wasn't for me losing over 2 stone in weight and discovering a true love for running and fitness in general my story could be currently very different. Running keeps me even. If I am upset, angry, frustrated or so low I cant think straight, I lace up my bright pink Nikes, stick in my ear phones, put my music on loud, and I run. I never plan a route. I never plan a particular distance. I just go, wherever my feet take me. My mind becomes deliciously blank, The white noise in my head disappears. I am free. I am not a Mam, a wife, a sufferer of depression, I am Claire. That feeling that comes when you finish is just so hard to describe. You feel alive. The sweat, your heart beating out your chest, your lungs on fire, it is just amazing. Add to this, smashing a Personal Best, well for that moment, any moments of suffering feel a million memories away!After a year of exercising and becoming the fittest I have ever been in my life, I decided I wanted to make it count. I wanted to give back. I started by completing Run Every Day January (clue is in the name) and raised over £300 for national Mind. It gave me such a sense of achievement and purpose, that I was donating for a cause so close to my heart and raising awareness, both of the charity itself and of mental health. It is such a taboo subject, still to this day, although situations are improving. I want to be part of the driving force that makes talking about your mental issues as common as talking about the flu! From this I decided I wanted to do more, but for my local Mind - Mind Middlesbrough & Stockton. Charity really does begin at home. Teesside is my adopted home, it is where I have had some of my toughest times in adult life but where I have learnt a lot and where I have met some of the most important people. With this in mind (no pun intended) I decided to sign up for my first professional race - Bamburgh 10km, in June 2017. I am so excited but nervous. I have also decided to train for the London Marathon in the hope I get a place in 2018. Fundraising again for the lovely team at Mind Middlesbrough & Stockton. As part of this training I will be completing the Bamburgh Half Marathon in October. A massive feat for someone that this time last year could only run for 20 minutes!My next steps - to complete these running challenges and raise as much money as possible in support and awareness of mental health. To add many more to my belt over the years. To continue with my mental health and fitness blog (redballoons2017.wordpress.com) and to continue to grow, learn and become part of the amazing volunteering team at Mind. I will also be a qualified Personal Trainer come July.With all the above in place I know my recovery is imminent. I will never be completely cured, but knowing I can give back to those suffering and in their won dark place will mean I have turned my demons into angels. It will make my own dark days have more of a rose coloured tint to them.Submitted by: Claire

I got an email back form the lovely Beth and before I knew it I was meeting her in person and chatting about what I could offer. I couldn't have asked for a friendlier face. I chose them because they are the Mind for my local area. I believe that in order to be able to start anywhere you need to start at home. This is my adopted hometown and I want to help those around me, who may be in similar situations, had similar upbringings and may not be aware of what is on their very doorstep. Mental health itself is an extremely daunting prospect, trying to find ways to support yourself can be even scarier, especially when you may not even have admitted fully to yourself never mind those nearest and dearest to you. Although I am a sufferer, severe depression is my card to play, I knew that I had the motivation and determination to put myself out there in order to raise awareness, and to get involved. If I can use my past or current experiences to help even one person, then all this sadness and suffering wont have been in vain. It could make a tiny difference in a world that currently still holds a lot of ignorance to this very subject. I feel proud to be part of such an amazing cause, a charity that goes out of its way to help anyone and everyone, that wants to erase the stigma of mental ill health and to support those who suffer or care for others that suffer. The impact it has had on my life, even in just the small time I have been part of it, has been phenomenal. Instead of feeling ashamed or embarrassed or avoiding my issues, I feel like I can wear them as  badge of experience and be part of something worthwhile. Something that could ultimately change the world, one town at a time. It doesn't have to take up a lot of your time, as a volunteer just being part of the team and giving up your time whenever you are able is much appreciated. You feel grateful that they want your time in any form. I would genuinely recommend volunteering to anyone. Any one who may have even just a spare hour a week. In that hour you could make so much more of a difference than you could ever imagine. You could help someone realise that they are not alone, something that you do could be something that someone else has never thought of and it could become something that they can adapt to work for them. You can hone in on skills that you may never have known you had, or fine tune the ones you do have. What I love most about it is meeting such a diverse range of people, and hearing their experiences, how they have become where they are, how they manage to cope and why they have chosen to be part of Mind, in whatever capacity that could be. The members I have met in my Anti Stigma group are truly an amazing bunch of people. I feel privileged to be part of them, to be involved in helping change the future with them but also of gaining new friends. I would love to be able to incorporate my passion for running and fitness into my volunteering at some point. It is a coping mechanism for me that has helped save my life pretty much. I want to give this back. I want to help people find their passion, whether it be fitness, running or something completely different. In regards to how volunteering helps my own mental health, well it is only in a positive way. I am starting to believe I have a true purpose. I am not completely sure what that is just yet but I know it involves working within mental health in some capacity and incorporating my fitness passion and qualifications. It is such an under utilised form of therapy. There is always something for someone, of any age, race and fitness level within their own personal interests. I am beginning to believe I am worth something, I do matter. Volunteering is now as much a necessary part of my life as my running, my medication and my counsellor. It will help me on my recovery journey as I hopefully help someone on theirs.If I could offer any advice it would be, go for it! Send that email. make that appointment, sell yourself and don't look back. Go on to make a difference in other peoples lives. I swear you wont regret it. Become a volunteer and become a person who gives back. Do it for the simple satisfaction. Money may make the world turn but it certainly cant buy the important things!Thank you Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind for helping me onto the correct path and opening up my eyes to an array of possibilities. We really will make a difference, one day at a time! Submitted by: Claire

Unapolagetically Me
For a good few months now I've been feeling really low about myself, which is not like me.

I was such a confident person and was so happy within myself, and I guess as I've grown up and matured a bit more and life has changed so much that I'm having to almost find myself again. When I say feeling down about myself I don't just mean the odd huff here and there because I've put on a bit of weight or I don't like my hair, I've been overthinking things I didn't used to. It all sparked because I gained a few pounds but then it kind of tumble weeded and I started to think about what other people thought of me.What if people think I'm mean for saying that? What if people think I'm stupid because I've forgotten something? What if they're looking at me thinking 'she's put on weight'? What if they don't like me?I guess I let one insecurity spark some more, which I shouldn't have done. Something that only my closest friends and boyfriend know is that I suffer with Anxiety. I haven't been properly diagnosed but I know I have it, I've suffered with panic attacks since I was in secondary school and my mind is pretty much always in over drive overthinking the smallest of things. However, I've realised that I just need to get back to my roots. Life got so hectic with work, Uni and family life that I forgot to take time out for me (and my little blog) so I've decided it's time to work on myself. By that I mean get healthier, lose the weight I put on, work on something that I love doing, create things and start to really enjoy life again.My weight does not define me. I can be forgetful. Sometimes I get annoyed a little too easily. I can let stressful situations get me down. You work to live, you don't live to work. I achieve something every day as my blog views go up. I'm funny. I have amazing people around me. I'm kind. I'd prefer to wear a baggy jumper and joggers over a dress any day. I'm pretty, even without make up. I need to work on my time keeping skills. I got a 1st in a Uni assignment with the rest pretty much all 2:1s, when an A was never in sight at school or college. I'm creative. I'm motivated. I'm talented. I'm me.These are some of the things that make up who I am, some good, some bad. It's hard to beat insecurities and learn to love yourself but every now and then it's good to sit down and remind yourself that you're actually doing ok.Submitted by: Lucy

Stigma in the workplace
One of the most prevalent topics in the mental health community seems to be stigma around mental health in the workplace. I’ve heard stories of people being told to deal with it; that they need to grow up; that their panic attacks wouldn’t happen to normal people; that they need to get a grip, and many, many other stories… Continue readingOne of the most prevalent topics in the mental health community seems to be stigma around mental health in the workplace. I’ve heard stories of people being told to deal with it; that they need to grow up; that their panic attacks wouldn’t happen to normal people; that they need to get a grip, and many, many other stories that show just how little people know or care about mental illnesses.A few weeks ago I attended an interview for a waitressing position. Despite my bad anxiety and depression, I was determined to make it work because, let’s face it, the economy is shit, and I need a job. The interview, a 1-1 with a lovely woman, went brilliantly, and I was invited back for a work trial during their evening dinner rush with two others trying out for similar roles. Each of us was shadowed by a supervisor, and the restaurant manager watched us throughout the trial. At the end he took each of us aside one by one to give us feedback before sending us home. I was called in last, and these were his exact words: “I was really concerned about you. You were terrified, it was making the customers tense”.I was shocked. Yes, I had been absolutely terrified of the work trial, but I managed to speak; I took orders; I did everything I was asked with a smile on my face. I knew my anxiety was visible, but I hadn’t realised just how much. To say that the customers were on edge because of how I was feeling was a kick to the stomach. One of the few reassurances throughout my struggles with anxiety, was that it wasn’t easily noticeable by the average person. People are so distracted by their own lives, they wouldn’t notice that you’re feeling particularly anxious about something. But they did notice. I, obviously, didn’t get the job.Many other people I’ve spoken to have had similar experiences: Bosses, managers, supervisors, and co-workers who don’t understand mental illness, don’t understand how it manifests, and treat the sufferer, quite frankly, like they’re overreacting and not capable of doing the job. This is why I suggested, in a twitter chat several weeks ago, that workplaces should be much more accepting of mental illness. Just as they include a disclaimer in an application- stating that they don’t discriminate based on age, gender, and so forth- they should include some form of reassurance about their treatment of those with mental illnesses.Now, don’t get me wrong, there are jobs out there that some of us can’t do, due to our illnesses. But for many of us, it is the treatment from co-workers, rather than the work itself, that stops us. I recently began volunteering with my local branch of Mind, and one of the things that keeps cropping up is the idea of a mental health supporter within workplaces. Just as every workplace needs a first-aid qualified staff member on duty at all times, they should also have somebody who has been trained in how to deal with mental illness. This would be a lifeline for those who are prone to, for example, panic attacks halfway through a shift.Workplaces and business, in general, should follow strict guidelines that, when followed and/or completed, give them accreditation as being somewhere safe for mental health sufferers to work. This doesn’t seem, to me, to be a big ask, but considering the stories I’ve heard from those who have discovered how little their managers care about their well-being, I’m not holding my breath that any big changes will be take place soon.Submitted by: Iona

Postnatal depression – my story
This week is Maternal Mental Health Week. So it seemed as good a time as any to write this blog, because it has been rattling around in my head for a while.

So it seemed as good a time as any to write this blog, because it has been rattling around in my head for a while. I’m pretty nervous about it, because some people in my life don’t know about my past mental health issues, and others know a bit but probably not any kind of detail. But I wanted to write this because of anybody out there who might feel ashamed or worried about how they feel about having a baby. When I first became a mother ten years ago the ‘Unmumsy Mum’ and ‘Hurrah for Gin’ social media frenzy wasn’t around. There wasn’t a lot of people openly talking about their struggles to cope with motherhood, so now I kind of think, the more of us talking about it, the better for everyone.This might go on a bit, so apologies if you get bored half way through. It has a happy ending though! If you’re pregnant for the first time, take this as a warning, it contains details of how things can go wrong during child birth!I was desperate to become a Mum. As a teenager I used to tell my teachers my ambition is life was to be a Mum. Looking back, this seemed a bit silly. I was always very driven and ambitious. But I wanted to be a good Mum. I wanted to do well at it. Anyone who knows me will know that being good at stuff is important to me. I wanted to do good at being a Mum.So when I fell pregnant with Hannah I was happy. I was in love with Hannah’s dad. We were due to get married. Actually we planned the wedding then found out I was pregnant. I was due to get married about seven weeks after my due date. I thought this would be fine. I was going to have give birth and then bounce back into shape, have a wedding and life with my new baby and my new husband would be perfect.I read everything there was to read about preparing for a baby. I watched documentaries about giving birth. I was determined to breastfeed my baby and in my head my life would pretty much be the same, except it would have a baby in it! I was also determined not be one of those neurotic Mums who worried about everything. I was going to be a cool, chilled out Mum. I had it all planned out.Pregnancy was good to me. I wasn’t sick or unwell, I ate well. I didn’t put on loads of weight. I loved being pregnant. I felt special and happy. When I went into labour everything went well. Eventually Hannah was born via ventouse delivery after I had been in labour for about 16 hours. She was perfect, and even though labour is horrible (it really flipping hurts!) everything was good. I spent twenty minutes bonding with her and breastfeeding her. Then everything went a bit wrong. They couldn’t get my placenta to come out and I was bleeding. After a while they started to panic and took me down to theatre.In theatre things took another turn for the worse. I was losing blood and the big African doctor spent a fair while trying to manoeuvre my placenta out of my body manually. Everyone panicked some more. There was lots of calls for more blood, and I was starting to lose consciousness. The nurses told me I was going to be put to sleep. I’d seen this on a documentary, I knew that if they couldn’t stop me bleeding they would take my womb out completely. They put me to sleep as I was begging them not to take out my womb, I already knew I wanted more than one baby.When I woke up I was in intensive care and a machine was breathing for me. When you see people immediately panic and try and pull the tube out of their throat on the telly programmes, it’s real. I tried to rip out the tube down my throat but they wouldn’t let me. I could only use my left hand as there were all sorts of tubes and wires coming out of me. My family came in to see me. I couldn’t talk but I could write, so I asked where Hannah was. She was being looked after by nurses. I asked how she was being fed. I was supposed to be breast feeding her. It was the next day, I didn’t want them to feed her with a bottle. I was reassured that she was being fed with a cup, so she didn’t get confused when I tried to feed her. After an hour or two the nurses took me off the ventilator and I could breathe on my own. I’d had nine units of blood transfused, which I think is pretty much all of it. I’d been in theatre for over four hours. Apparently my family had been told to phone every hour to see if I was still alive. They managed to stop me bleeding without taking my womb out, which was a massive relief for me.So the next day, or later that day (I’ve never been sure how long anything took) I was moved to my own room, and a nurse wheeled a baby in next to me. The first thing I thought was “I don’t know whose baby that is, that could be anybody’s baby” I didn’t recognise her. We’d been apart for over 24 hours. I was too unwell to look after her. I remember having the worst headache ever and not wanting to keep my eyes open. Everybody else in the room was cuddling Hannah, and cooing. I could barely hold my head up. when she cried the nurses came and took her away so I could rest. They were feeding her with a bottle, but I didn’t realise this at the time.I was in hospital for a week I think, with Hannah, recovering and trying to breast feed her. I couldn’t move my legs for a few days, which was challenging when trying to look after a new born. Then the maternity ward moved and they forgot to take me with them, that day they didn’t bring me any food! Hannah lost lots of weight and would scream every time she wasn’t latched on. I had no milk, and it never turned up. I think my body had been through so much, it wasn’t really in the mood to start producing milk as well as trying to mend me! I was also on loads of painkillers, blood thinners and other drugs. Its no wonder I had no milk to feed her with. But at the time I didn’t know. When we took her home she kept losing weight. So we fed her milk with a little cup, which meant we could sleep. Then I sent Dad out to buy some bottles. I was devastated that I couldn’t feed her. The health visitor told me the only way to get my milk production up was to basically spend 24 hours with her latched onto me and hope that my body got the message and kicked in its milk production. I couldn’t face the idea of this, at the time I just wanted her to sleep.I dreaded her waking up, because I didn’t want to have to feed her with a bottle. I felt like a failure and that everyone was judging me. I didn’t really understand what had happened to me or my life. I wanted to give her back. I already felt like I’d failed her somehow, and I just wasn’t good enough. And everybody seemed so attached to her. I remember asking my Mum why everyone seemed to love her more than I did. She told me to stop being silly because of course I loved her. And I did, but at the time I didn’t feel like I did.So I got married, and on the surface everything was fine. But on the inside things were not fine. I struggled with looking after Hannah. I constantly felt like she was someone else’s baby and at some point someone would come and end my shift and return her to her real Mum. Mostly I felt like I was babysitting her for someone else. In public I felt self conscious and like everyone was judging me. I hated taking her to get weighed because I was sure everyone was watching me and thinking I was getting it wrong. I used to feel panic when she woke up, because I knew she would need something from me ad I wasn’t sure whether I would be able to get it right. I didn’t ever feel good enough for her.At the time I just battled through. I had good days and bad days, and tried to stay positive and busy. I went back to work and life kept moving. But I hadn’t really dealt with the trauma of giving birth. I was expecting to give birth and fall in love with my baby, and look at her and know she was the most precious thing in the world to me, but I didn’t get to experience that. And actually have since realised that this is not uncommon. Quite a lot of Mums don’t immediately feel that attachment to their babies. But I am the kind of person who likes to get things right, I wanted things to be the way I thought they were supposed to be. And it went so horribly wrong that I didn’t really come to terms with it.So I felt the best thing to do was to . . . . .do it all again. So I got pregnant with Emily. There was going to be an eighteen month gap between them. I desperately wanted to have a normal birth and get to take home my baby. Instead Emily was born eight weeks early and wasn’t breathing for herself. And my placenta got stuck inside me again. Thankfully this time they had blood ready to pump into me and they got it out in theatre without all the drama, so it wasn’t so bad. Emily was in the neonatal unit for three and half weeks. I tried my hardest to bond with her as much as possible, which is tricky when she was in an incubator and poorly. I was so determined to breast feed this baby that I pumped milk manually around the clock so that they could feed it to her down her tube when she was tiny. And I did manage to breast feed her for a few weeks when she came home. Thankfully she was discharged as a healthy happy (but tiny!) baby.I was more prepared to not enjoy baby Emily, I had lower expectations, and so found it all a bit less traumatic than Hannah. She was more attached to me as a baby, she seemed to need me more, and I was better at it the second time round. But by this point I had lost all sense of who I was. I had become anxious and depressed, and I wasn’t even aware of it. By the time Emily was eighteen months old I was a bit disconnected from the world. On bad days it felt like I was watching myself from a metre back, like I was watching a film. I couldn’t get to the front of my own life anymore, I was on autopilot. I couldn’t stay in the moment long enough to enjoy anything, and there seemed to be no end. I couldn’t understand why I didn’t enjoy anything anymore. Nothing seemed to bring me any joy. From the outside most people didn’t know how I was feeling. The people closest to me tell me now that they were worried about me, but I’m not sure by this point there was anything anyone could have done. I hadn’t realised how much I’d changed. I was so focused on getting through the day and ticking everything off my list of things I needed to get through, that I hadn’t noticed how depressed I was.Ultimately the pressure of trying to cope and not really understanding what the problem was, contributed to the end of my marriage. It’s not the only factor, there were many factors, but it’s hard to know how things might have turned out if I had got help sooner. Hannah and Emily’s Dad was always so good at the parenting thing. He was the most chilled out, capable Dad, he still is, and he seemed to enjoyed it so much. In fact everyone around me seemed to be doing a much better job at parenting my babies than I was. When I left them (and I walked out on all three of them) I was convinced that they would be better off without me. At that point I was in such a bad place I didn’t think the girls would notice, and I thought I could happily live without them.It makes me really really sad to write that, because of course it isn’t true. I didn’t go a day without seeing them and they really needed me. Bit by bit I rebuilt my life and my relationship with them both. They were still babies, Hannah was three, Emily was just coming up two, we sorted out shared-care, so that they spent equal amounts of time with me and their Dad.Actually, left to my own devices without fear of judgement, comparison or anyone watching me, I realised I was dong a decent job. I started to enjoy being their Mum. I started to care less what people thought. I stopped feeling like their babysitting big sister and stopped worrying so much. This was helped by a course of anti-depressants, which I took for nine months and they really made a difference. Then the girls got older and this helped too. It turns out I’m not a baby person. I’m awesome once they turn about four.I now work for a mental health charity and looking back, it seems obvious that I needed some more support to deal with the trauma and shock of being so poorly after Hannah was born, and the postnatal depression that followed. I was probably also suffering with post traumatic stress disorder. By the time I realised I was broken, it was too late. I hadn’t realised how lost I was.There is so much pressure on new Mums, and so much stigma and judgement about how to do it right. If you’re like me and you like to do things right, this can be really difficult to cope with. Most of what I wanted to ‘get right’ was completely out of my control.Now, ten years later, I’m in really good therapy which is helping with my anxiety. It turns out I was probably always struggling with anxiety, and this was definitely exacerbated when I became a Mum. There is so much to be anxious about with a new baby!I suppose I’m writing this because it feels important to me, and because I want to add something to the conversation about motherhood and postnatal depression and stigma. I’m not looking for sympathy or understanding (or judgement!) I just want anyone out there who might relate to anything I have written to know they are not alone. I don’t know if it will upset some people close to me, because some of it is hard to write, let alone read. But it is the truth about the way I felt at the time. And if you’re Hannah or Emily reading this, please know I love you, and I have always done my best, even if sometimes I didn’t think my best was good enough.I feel lucky now that I have such an amazing relationship with Hannah and Emily, and I feel grateful everyday that I get to be their Mum. Some days I still feel like I’m just not good enough for them, but I have new coping strategies to deal with these days.There is help out there, professional help and support groups and help lines. There are some links at the bottom of this page. If you have thought for even a second ‘maybe I should talk to someone about how I feel’ then the chances are you would benefit from help, and the sooner you can get to sit in front of someone and talk about how you feel, the easier it gets.We spend so much time comparing ourselves to other people and feeling like we fall short. Any Mum that tells you they have it sussed is lying, we are all just winging it, and we need to be there to support each other.Submitted by: Michelle

Getting outside in the fresh air for a run helps me to clear my head, release the stress of the day, gives me a sense of purpose and achievement, reduces my anxiety levels and boosts my mood.  When I run I feel free. Anyone can run, it doesn't matter what age, size or shape you are.  All you need is a pair of trainers.  I would recommend it to anyone for its benefits on mental health.Submitted by: Lizzie

When the memory fades.
I have been suffering with depression since my late teens/early twenties.

I did not know it was depression until my mid twenties, and then in my early thirties I was told it is actually bipolar disorder that I have been suffering with.For me, two of the most worrying things that happen during the difficult times, aside from the suicidal thoughts and feelings of being worthless and useless, is, 1. my memory goes out of the window and 2. my behaviour becomes slightly erratic. I tend to start doing things completely in the spur of the moment or I cannot remember locking the front door thirty seconds ago.The two things combined can make social situations really difficult, trying to remember if I locked all the windows or did I turn the iron off after I ironed my clothes. If you combined these two things with being anxious about social situations in the first place, then it can make even just leaving the house a living nightmare.Sometimes I don't see things coming until the strange behaviour starts, clicking the button on the car key to open the front door of the house and thinking “why wont this door open” or looking in the fridge for a carrier bag and saying to myself “where are all the carrier bags, I thought we had loads”, are just two examples of the things I have done during the start of a recent downward turn.I really fear that one day I might forget something really important that would cause untold trouble.As a result of this I have developed OCD, everything is checked and then checked again and just to be safe checked one last time and certain objects around the house have to be in certain places before I am satisfied that I'm not going to burn the house down or that the house is safe and secure before I leave.I have, however, found three coping mechanisms that help me no end when things are starting to go bad.  I have started to go to the gym, healthy body, healthy mind and all that. The second one is my love of astronomy. Standing in the middle of nowhere with no light pollution, no noises or people about like in a town or city centre, just me, my telescope and the universe. Realising how far away our nearest neighbours are in the solar system or just how big the universe actually is, really helps to put everything into perspective. And the third thing is reading. Keeping my mind active helps to sharpen things up, and getting buried in a good book is a great way for me to keep my memory from going astray, imagining the descriptions in a book being played out in my mind is a great thing to keep sharp.Sometimes, these things do not always work. Some days, I just want to keep the curtains closed and stay locked in my bedroom where the world can’t get at me and I don't have to worry about social situations or if I have forgotten to do something. Then there are the times when everything is fine. Nothing to worry about, the OCD dies down a little bit and social situations are easier to deal with.But in the back of my mind I'm always expecting something to come out of the blue, something that will cause my memory to fade again.Submitted by: Paul

Understanding anxiety
I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder a couple of years ago but, like most people will tell you, you can suffer from something for a long time before it’s actually recognised as a diagnosable illness.I remember begging to stay home from school because I didn’t know how I was going to make it through my maths… Continue readingI was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder a couple of years ago but, like most people will tell you, you can suffer from something for a long time before it’s actually recognised as a diagnosable illness.I remember begging to stay home from school because I didn’t know how I was going to make it through my maths class without feeling my chest tighten and my heart pound into my throat. I remember having to sit close to an exit in exams in case I needed to speed out of the room and hyperventilate. I remember almost having to leave college because my anxiety became so bad that, for a long period of time, I couldn’t bring myself to enter classrooms.Thankfully, through the help of medication, I managed to make it through four years of university with very little trouble. Sure, sometimes I felt sick, sometimes I had to take a minute away from everybody and calm myself down. But I did it. I graduated with a first class undergraduate degree, and a distinction graded postgraduate degree, despite feeling, just a few years before, that I wouldn’t be able to get my A levels.But just because that part of my life is over, doesn’t mean the anxiety is gone. Medication isn’t always a cure. Sometimes it’s just a way to prevent the illness going any further, like a wall of sandbags on the edge of the dam in your mind.The dream of being a successful writer is difficult to achieve when you live in a part of the country with very few opportunities, and no money to tide you over while you move down south and complete unpaid internships. So, inevitably, I’m looking for other work while I try to break into the industry that I love the most. This means enhancing my CV, taking on local work experience, and volunteering opportunities. Not easy when you have a hard time leaving the house at all, and an even harder time making yourself speak to people.Next Friday I have agreed to go along to a local mental health charity’s volunteering morning. They meet once a month and generate ideas for how to raise awareness of the charity and mental illness as a whole. Despite this being a wonderful opportunity, I’m already terrified, and the damn thing is almost a week away!Anxiety can make you worry and panic about every aspect of something. What if I can’t find a way to get there? What if I get there late? What if I get there early and have to sit around the reception for an hour like a creep? What if I make a fool of myself? What if nobody there likes me? What if I’m too nervous to talk and they all think I’m stupid? What if I can’t think of any ideas? What if? What if? What if?Anxiety will do that. It takes everything that could possibly go wrong, and throws them at you like there’s no tomorrow. It overwhelms you, it makes you feel sick, it makes your stomach turn and your head cloudy. It makes you want to cancel and give up.The biggest problem is, despite having anxiety for over a decade, I still don’t know how to beat it. It just… seems to happen every now and then. Somehow, sometimes, I manage to find the strength to beat it back long enough for me to get through something and realise that, actually, there wasn’t anything to worry about.Anxiety, like my depression, is a daily struggle. Some days are inexplicably harder than others. Some days I’ll want to curl up in a ball, lock my door, and refuse to move for anybody or anything.It wins more than I do, but I think just knowing that it’s anxiety, and not a real fear based on real evidence, makes it that little bit easier to push away as you fight through. Maybe it’s because I’ve had it for so long, or maybe it’s because I know that if I don’t go to this meeting, I’ll be sabotaging my own career goals by not volunteering and getting good experience for my CV. Either way, I’m determined to win this time.Submitted by: Iona

Overthinking things like “ugh I sounded like a right idiot when I asked that” makes my anxiety worse, overthinking is extremely common when you have anxiety. Overthinking rules my brain, everything I want to do, I overthink. Let’s say, for example, I want to go out with a few friends. I overthink things like “what happens if I fall over” “what happens if I do something stupid and everyone laughs”  “what happens if I stutter and just sound idiotic to people”It’s annoying, just due to the fact that I plan on doing things, like going out with a few friends. I overthink about the social situation and think that people will find me weird, and think I’m silly for being so anxious and panicky, and just end up cancelling. I try so hard to look for a solution or something else to stop overthinking, but my mind just cant stop thinking about that situation, I don’t know why I do it if I did I would try to stop, but nope, don’t know why I do it.There’s so much involved with overthinking, past situations for me make my overthinking worse, and I’ve heard from people that it is the same for them. I overthink so many social situations solely down to stuff that has happened, such as panicking in public. I also overthink things that have happened. Like “oh I shouldn’t have said that” “why did I say that” Overthinking for me is also solely down to my anxiety/social anxiety. I continuously overthink about what I come across like, what people think I am, what people think of me when I panic, panicking in public.Overthinking is a cycle, and I’m currently caught up in that cycle of overthinking mostly everything. For me, avoiding situations which I overthink about, will obviously not help and I am trying to slowly do those situations i.e go out with friends and socialise etc.I hope I can get out of this vicious cycle of overthinking, as it is truly tiring and constant battle.Submitted by: Liam

This is my story
My name is Dan, I'm 44 and I've suffered with depression for about 20 years. During this time I've done pretty much everything I can to help myself and a great many things I could, to destroy myself. I am currently in a period of great stability and I am starting a foundation degree in September, continuing my own journey… Continue readingMy name is Dan, I'm 44 and I've suffered with depression for about 20 years. During this time I've done pretty much everything I can to help myself and a great many things I could, to destroy myself. I am currently in a period of great stability and I am starting a foundation degree in September, continuing my own journey to becoming a counsellor.This is my story.My first breakdown was in 2001/2002, I didn't realise it was a breakdown, at the time I attributed it to some kind of early mid-life crisis (I was turning 30) but it was also around this time I found out my dad had lung cancer and the financial impact of been made redundant 18 months earlier had started to become evident. It manifested itself in very strange ways and my behaviour became erratic and I questioned my whole life. All the things I'd worked for came into question.During my late teens and early twenties I'd always felt moody, short fused, angry at things even had times were I couldn't go to work, but I just put it down to my personality, and being unhappy in my job. It never really crossed my mind that I could be depressed. I thought people like me don’t get depressed, I'm happy go lucky, the life and soul of the party, the clown. Looking back I used crutches, alcohol and drugs. I knew I was using them to block out things, try and make me feel better and escape but again I just put this down to "well that's just life"Over a period of probably 10/15 years from the late 90's, when I realised things weren't quite right, I saw a range of mental health nurses, counsellors and even a psychiatrist and took different medications, but I still didn't really accept that I was ill, but looking back no one actually told me I was. And the stigma of mental health has been bred into society for so many years that to admit you have a mental illness is very difficult.I got made redundant in 2000 and changed careers, which was a big deal. Financially it was huge I went from earning about £12 ph to about £5 ph. But I didn't think about it too much I just cracked on, because that's what I thought you did.....just cracked on.After my most recent breakdown, which in all honesty was the worse one I've suffered. I found myself in tears in a carpark deciding which way I was going to end this current life, would I kill myself? Run away? After the initial pain my wife and son would surely be better off without me? I couldn't believe this was it, after all these years I had reached the point of no return, after all the hurt and pain I had caused to those who loved me, this is where it was going to end, in a carpark on a wet winters morning, the day before I had arranged to return to work, alone. My head was swimming and I couldn't breathe. I was battling with my own mind, rationale was telling me to go home, that I could get through this, but my irrational side was saying, you've been through too much, you've hurt too many people and the worst thought of all this will show them I wasn't making anything up. My phone was ringing for what seemed like an age, before I answered it and my wife pleaded with me to go home. I drove home in a daze thinking what if I just crash the car or turn into the traffic? Once home things are very blurred and it's difficult to remember what actually happened. I did return to work and even in the fragile state I was in I felt some relief. Over the coming weeks I began to feel stronger and my confidence slowly started to return. It now feels as if I had to go to the edge of the abyss, that that day in the carpark was a definitive moment.In early 2014 after a spell off work I started seeing a person centred counsellor. I'd had counselling before in the form of CBT, which in all honesty hadn't really worked for me, whether that was a reluctance on my part to fully accept I was ill I'm not sure, but there had been short term results but nothing life changing. The big difference this time was I had sought out counselling rather than it been advised to me. Once I started my sessions it became quite clear this wasn't like any form of counselling or talking therapy I had previously had, there was no, on a scale of 1-10 how likely are you to harm yourself? Think about a happy place etc. etc. Now I believe CBT has its place, however it had been proved in the past it wasn't what I needed, but I fully believe in the process of counselling and would never discourage someone from seeking any form of counselling or talking therapy.These sessions were about me, about my feelings and where they came from. Over time I learnt about why I felt like I did and most of all that I wasn't going crazy, that these feelings were natural. And if they were dealt with correctly, could actually be used to my advantage. I became more confident about talking about my feelings, about my depression and I wanted to help change people's view, help lift that stigma. I decided either I became a part of the solution or I was a part of the problem and I came to the decision that I wanted to help people and I wanted to be a counsellor, I wanted to become a part of the solution.I now feel emotionally stronger than I can ever remember, I have control over my emotions, not all the time. But you know what? That's fine I'm human I'm not a machine. I am on a road that I actually want to be on, both emotionally and with my career. And I can finally accept me for who I am, and that's Dan. Yes I suffer from mental illness but I can accept it's a part of me and I now know I can be stronger than it can.Peace, love & laughter Dan. xSubmitted by: Dan Briggs

Stigma in the workplace
When joining the anti-stigma project, with the charity MIND, a question presented itself to me.

Namely what exactly is stigma?The dictionary defines stigma as “a mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality or person,” with synonyms like disgrace or dishonour.Stigma then, is defined as a mark of disgrace that sets a person apart. When a person is labelled by their illness, they are seen as a stereotyped group. Thus, negative attitudes create prejudice, which leads to negative actions and discrimination.The figurative meaning “a mark of disgrace” is from the 1610’s, but its origins come from the 1500’s Latin/Greek “a tattoo mark denoting result of action.”It seems from this that a mental health condition, is seen as disgraceful and that person has brought it upon themselves, as a result of an action they have taken.It seems nonsensical to me, that a definition of something with roots so far back in history, can still have an impact in today's modern society. There can be no doubt though, that it does happen. However, the dictionary definition does not describe the impact it has on the individual on the receiving end. Nor does it consider that it may come from many sources, such as from work colleagues, friends and even relatives. It is also likely that it will take more than one form. For example, they may have been passed over for promotion, at work, because they are considered as unreliable, while at home they may be treated as a child, with no valid opinion of their own. For an individual then, stigma is experienced in a very personal way. Consequently there can be no one single intervention that would prevent it, so a more holistic and personal approach, alongside a wider awareness and understanding strategy may be needed.As an individual who has experienced stigma, myself, identifying the sources, types and my personal experience of it, may establish interventions that may have supported me through my mental health condition.Looking back, I realise now, that problems with my mental health began long before they reached the crescendo they did. It began, I believe, when I moved to the other end of the country due to my husband’s work. In doing so, I began to lose my identity because I did not fit in. My northern accent signalled me out immediately as different and there was a yawning gap in cultural differences.I started working in a school doing a graduate training programme and problems surfaced almost immediately. Because of the accent, I was labelled common and as ignorant and was given no support, or guidance at all. I had no friends or family close, so became very isolated and that is when the panic attacks first began. They were terrifying! I thought I was dying but I had no one to turn to, no one to tell.I soldiered on for a while but sought help, from the family doctor, after I collapsed at work due to a panic attack. I believe, this is when a better intervention might have prevented the spiralling deterioration of my mental health. I was simply prescribed anti-depressants.I feel that if the doctor had also explained, I was suffering from a mental health condition and referred me to a support group, and perhaps for Counselling, the condition may not have escalated. Extra training, for the doctor, on identifying early potential metal health conditions, may also have been beneficial.It was after my collapse, that I experienced my first taste of being stigmatised by my work colleagues. When I returned to work, the atmosphere was cold. Some members of staff avoided me while others refused to speak to me. I overheard a conversation, about me, along the lines that I was “just putting it on to gain attention because I was lazy.”Needless to say, I did not complete the teacher training course.Life carried on regardless and I was forced, by financial need, to find another job. Initially, I was signalled out as different as my self-confidence was very low. I arrived back at work, one afternoon, to find all my files and paperwork piled on another desk. I was told that, a new starter needed my desk as she was more likely not to have a meltdown. I had never had any kind of melt down but I was considered to have “problems” which would lead to one.I believe that, specific awareness of, and anti-stigma training should form an integral part of any organisations, ongoing, professional development requirements. It may be that organisations might consider this as unnecessary or too expensive. However, I feel certain that, if statistics on absences from work due to “stress,” “anxiety” etc. etc. were analysed, they would reveal the requirements would be of great benefit.For the purposes of this project then, gathering such statistics, could offer an excellent opportunity to open dialogue with employers and encourage participation. One way of gathering them, might be to devise an anonymous questionnaire for staff. Devising and offering “workshops” would also, not only benefit employers and staff, but possibly encourage someone experiencing mental health to realise its ok to seek help.Experiencing stigma in the workplace, could potentially be reduced in a practical way, with the introduction of specific training for all members of staff. Tackling stigma from within a family, or friend, environment may prove more difficult.My first experience of this, was when, a well-meaning, friend asked my daughter, why she was trusting an unstable woman (me) to babysit. She asked why my daughter wasn't worried that social services would be informed.The other experience is still ongoing and comes from “family” who do not invite me to birthday parties and other family get togethers. Some, have ostracised me completely and will go out of their way to avoid making eye contact, and therefore having to speak to me.Some also post thinly veiled references to my condition on social media. Almost always painting me as unhinged, deranged and “other.”These final experiences are the most hurtful and painful for me, as I have no answers to why they do this... Instead, they just amplify my feelings of isolation, self-loathing and my own internal, I'm not good enough, dialogue. My coping strategy for this, is simply to try and avoid them. However, that prevents me from undertaking an activity I used to enjoy, as some of them attend it. It has also affected my ability to join in any social group activities.I have no real answers, or even suggestions, on how to tackle this type of stigma.  I believe that, if mental health was more widely accepted as a medical condition, society might gradually become more accepting. Submitted by: Janet

Meaning that I go 12 hours without food every single day. Due to this I have meal replacement drinks instead 2. I can't eat anything without using knives and forks. Which means in public I have to eat with plastic cutlery3. I wash my hands continuously. Sometimes it's 20 or 30 times. Sometimes it takes half and hour. Sometimes I have to do it till it feels just right 4. I have to check the door 50 or so times before I leave the house until it feels just right 5. I can't work at a table in college until I've wiped it down with an anti-bac wipe 6. I have to wear gloves when I leave the house, whatever the weather, hot or cold 7. My feet and elbows are excellent at opening doors and flushing toilet handles. 8. Public toilets terrify me, so I avoid them at all costs. 9. My hands are sore, bleeding and cracked because of the over washing 10. I struggle to touch people. I'm not too bad with hugging but kissing and holding hands is a massive no 11. Which currently puts any form of relationship off limits 12. As a result, I spend a significant amount of my time alone13. I have poured neat bleach over my hands. Sometimes up to five times a day.14. I've struggled to sleep because I would wake up in the night in a panic that I wasn't clean enough.15. I hoard empty hand sanitizer bottles in the fear that if I throw one away something bad will happen 16. What and where I eat is decided on the ease of eating that food with cutlery.17. For example, I eat crisps with a spoon. I try to avoid crisps when I'm out and about because I get a lot of stares 18. As a child, I was paranoid of the house catching fire or people breaking in. 19. I was always asking my mum for reassurance that the door was locked be the smoke detector was in20. I have anxiety and panic attacks 21. Sometimes I burst into tears, start rocking back and worth and start hyperventilating 22. Other times I go really quiet. I don't move and stare into the distant 23. And sometimes I have a fit of anger and rage. Afterwards, I break down 24. Panic attacks mean that I miss a lot of lessons at college and sometimes can't even get to the lesson at all. 25. Going to public places and using public transport scares me a lot26. I get panicky in places that I can't escape easily. I worry that people are going to be sick and I won't be able to get away 27. I sweat and overheat in the summer as I have to wear long sleeves to cover my hands to avoid me getting contaminated 28. I can't even hug or kiss my own parents29. I've sprayed my hands continuously with antibacterial surface spray.30. I have come incredibly close to burning myself because I've refused to touch the kettle handle with my hand and instead use my jumper. Using the phrase "I'm so OCD" which is often used in such a loose and misunderstood way, I wanted to accurately highlight the reality of what it's like to live with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This week (20-26th Feb) is OCD actions, week of action in which they focus on taking action to get help for your OCD, to help others with OCD and to have meaningful conversations about OCD. In light of OCD Action week, I thought I would share 30 reasons why "I'm so OCD" and actually hopefully help you understand that Obsessive Compulsive Disorder isn't all about being neat, tidy and organised it's actually a severe mental illness that completely tears life's apart. Hopefully, by continuing to talk about my own experiences with OCD, I will encourage others to do the same and maybe, just maybe, over time help reduce the stigma. Submitted by: Nicole

Change - From an autistic person

If I can help someone here, I will feel that writing this will have been justified as I was completely overwhelmed when I did write my original post. Hope I am of some help to you.I'm a 19-year old from North East England with autism. When writing this at first, I purposefully don't say I have autism because unfortunately for me, autism has become somewhat of an excuse, at least that was through my experience in secondary school. I have regrets with how I handled myself in the past regarding my autism, and I hate to ever bring it up.Apparently I have high functioning autism, so I am able to think for myself but like everyone else (This is not just an autism exclusive thing), I have difficulties. Primarily, change.So I have a fairly structured life, and after I left college, I have been wondering how my life is going to change. Since I left, I have been working with a few people in recent weeks to get a job, so that is obviously a good thing, but what I am worried about is how my life is going to go afterwards.Right now, I have a fairly relaxed routine in my life. I have a chilled orange Lucozade on a morning, I play a lot on my PS4 with my friends, I hang out with my childhood best mate Matthew occasionally and I see many movies. I've said this before, I am grateful for what I have and never want to take too much, I seek to give back to the world.But with giving back, will mean change, and I rarely react well to change. Not that I don't want to, I really do but when I consider a lot of things before they happen, the possibilities do overwhelm me.The reason that prompted me to write this, there's this absolutely lovely lady I know. We aren't close, infact we only really speak when we had the chance briefly back in college but every time I would see her out and about, she would smile the bonniest smile at me and wave, and I'd reciprocate however I knew I could.I have been encouraged by a dear friend to talk to her, but I am discouraged not only by the fact that we barely know each other, but by what would lie ahead as far as relationships go should I pursue one with her. It's a scary thought, and perhaps an unnecessary one since nobody should fear for that the second they start thinking about talking to a girl they like, but the issue stems to more than that.Back in December, I actually got into a relationship (Briefly) with a girl who said she liked me, and I liked her. We kissed, and we walked to our class together before she disappeared - I assume back to her friends - and broke up with me, and so that was the time that I was played, however that isn't important to my point.In that brief quarter of an hour that I was in what I thought would end up being, my first proper in-real-life relationship, I did think a lot about how to be a good boyfriend. Up until that point, all my past partners had been over the phone, and I had the cushion of only really going to my phone to speak to them.But this, a relationship with someone who I could interact with in the flesh on a seemingly daily basis was and as we know, still is such an alien thing for me. Very rarely do I really leave my house, and on the rare occasion that I do, I'm with my friend Matthew or other friends like Ash or Lauren etc.So just to solidify my point, I rarely do new stuff, heck I don't even drink alcohol and I never really go to parties or big social events at all. The idea of being with someone who I'd care about, would open me up to so many possibilities that I know would be out of my comfort zone, it intrigues me but I do worry about change, about seeming like a hindrance to everyone around me because of my complete lack of adaptability.What would someone see in me? A boring and introverted individual? What new possibilities are there in a relationship? How would I be a decent partner? So many questions.It does not just stem into relationships. I recently left college and now I want to work, I do not feel in good conscience just sitting in my house all day playing GTA and Rocket League. But I do have reservations about first of all, how I do earn my job, I want to earn it and not get gifted it and knowing I won't be perceived as having earned it because I did not go to university.Secondly, what will come of it? Interacting with co-workers, the public, my superiors, heck they're probably reading this and mocking me, but for all I care, they can do one the insensitive (Insert word here after my mum reads this).But if I can help someone with the same problem, I feel I will have been justified in writing this. The necessity of knowing how to articulate what concerns you, the removal of a routine and the many possibilities of the road your life heads down can prompt you to ask these questions. This is beginning to sound more and more like a self help book, I have just noticed.If there is one thing I hope I can tell you, it's that the people around you will surely care enough for you to acknowledge when you have difficulties. The biggest mistake I ever made was continued persisting and ignoring problems, letting my emotions build, and I have huge regrets from not taking action against things that bothered me.After my final performance showcase with my Performing Arts group, it was an emotional time as we had been all together for two years. We had all grown so close, and as a final gesture, we were all asked to gather for a photo so I tried to slot myself in, but was pushed aside as if I was insignificant and in a rage, I walked off and I don't think anyone noticed. So if I see that photo on all my friend's social media, I regret that I never spoke up.I really managed to begin feeling that way once I spoke to a dear friend, who was a part of our Performing Arts group for the first year.For a few months, I was working with someone who was helping me out with my emotional issues. I'd say she was a psychologist but apparently it was some less fancy word that I can't remember, nevertheless after that time I noticed how I was very heavily dependent on myself to keep my issues from others, out of fear of making it seem like I was adding to their list of concerns.This stemming from when I was in secondary school, I'd get personally involved with someone I considered a friend with their issues. It led to me becoming way too unhappy, worrying about their issues when really in most cases, I shouldn't have got myself too invested in their issues.So this stemmed through to now, where I never like putting forward my emotions in any sense. But now, I need that more than ever, change is happening for me and I have the cushion of very helpful and loving people around me. So if you're ever going through change, have someone by your side, and if you don't, reach out to someone you know - not think - will support you.Because if the incredible movie 'X+Y' ('A Brilliant Young Mind' in America) taught me anything, it is that if someone loves you, they see something in you, that they think is worth something. That - in my words - 'tolerating' you is not actually tolerating, if only you're willing to try then they will hold your hand.If this has helped at least one person, I'll be happy.Submitted by: Luca

Take a friend for example, who makes a typical 'I'm so OCD' statement right in front of you when they know full well just how much OCD impacts upon your life. Or take your parent who tells you to 'pull yourself together' or 'just get over yourself'. They more than anyone should know that such comments are completely inappropriate, yet sometimes it seems to go over their head.Most of the time I can ignore these comments entirely. I’ve suffered from OCD quite severely in the past and stereotypical comments about this disorder seem to be a regular occurrence, a part of many people’s everyday vocabulary. Those close to me have not always understood my mental health conditions and it has led them to say things which I’ve found rather upsetting - whether intended or not. Sometimes though, it's not so easy to deal with. When you are so caught up in criticising yourself all of the time, it can really hurt to hear somebody else (somebody who should be supporting you the most) aim such negatives comments directly at you.So how are you supposed to deal with such comments when they can be so damaging? How can you brush them off and not let them affect you so much? Here are a few things which I try to keep in mind myself:I think firstly, you must see these types of comments for exactly what they are: ignorant. Ignorance stems from a lack of understanding and education. It leads people to say things which they might not say if they were to know the full extent of the situation. At the end of the day, they do not have the first clue what it is like to be in your head, so of course they aren't going to understand just how detrimental their comments could be. Try to recognise that they are misinformed. Nothing they say about your condition is of any value because it is coming from a place of non-understanding.Secondly, you could perhaps try and educate them. Print out a leaflet from the web about your condition: the causes, the symptoms etc. Hand it to them and ask them to read it. Alternatively, consider taking them to a therapy session with you, ask a mental health professional to explain on your behalf. If they hear it coming from a professional, they may be more likely to take it seriously. If this is not possible, maybe sit down with them and show them a video explaining your condition - anything which you think might keep them listening.I understand that some people (no matter how much you try to convince them otherwise) will out-right refuse to educate themselves. Their beliefs are set in stone and they are not open to changing them. In this case, maybe it is best to accept that whilst you cannot change what they think or say, you can choose how you respond. You can choose to brush their comments off as ignorance and lack of understanding. You will be the much better person by simply not acknowledging their comments and choosing not to retaliate.Lastly, bear in mind that there ARE people out there who understand. If it feels like those around you only ever say things that hinder rather than help your recovery, it can become isolating. However, there are so many people in a similar situation to yours right now who understand how you’re feeling and how unhelpful insensitive comments can be. I know how lonely it can get sometimes but you must believe me when I say that you aren’t alone, many people do understand.Submitted by: Lisa

Volunteering has helped me massively
I naturally see the potential in others and hope to instil confidence and self belief in them so that they can achieve too. Becoming a volunteer has shown that people have trust, faith and belief in me and this has made a massive difference to me, a huge difference, an incredible boost.Submitted by: Steven

Well, no actually I’m not, I’m not OK.”I’m not OK.Three small words, yet three of the biggest words you can ever say out loud. Yet, to so many people – and especially men – these words are almost impossible to say. Some people retreat ever further into themselves, others overcompensate by being overly cheerful as they try to maintain the illusion that they are fine.No matter who surrounds us – friends, colleagues, loved ones – sometimes we feel all alone and all we want is for one person, just one, to take us aside and ask, ‘Are you OK?’ The conversation that opens this post was the first conversation I had with my doctor as I slid into my first crippling depression. It had been coming for around 3 months and getting worse to the point that it was seriously affecting my ability to function in daily life. My grip was loosening day by day as my mental health deteriorated and it was becoming more and more apparent to me that this wasn’t just going to go away.It was only at this point that I began to realise that what was happening to me was an illness; it was something that was happening to me, not something that I was doing to myself by ‘being miserable’ or failing to ‘cheer up’. I was suffering with clinical depression.Since that first horrific episode 10 years ago I have suffered a major relapse in 2013 that lasted four months and a smaller one in December 2015. Through these experiences I have learned to recognise the signs that things are not quite right with me; on their own these signs can seem pretty innocuous but if I have a number of them together and they last more than a few days then I know that I need to be more vigilant with and take better care of myself.These signs include:• Lack of motivation• Feeling tired all the time• Waking early / disturbed sleep• Withdrawing and wanting to be on my own• Lack of spontaneous thought• Loss of interest in things that I usually enjoy, especially listening to music• Lack of patience and becoming snappyThis increased self awareness is an important part of recovery and being able to recognise potential triggers helps me to guard against complacency and tells me, ‘Hey, be careful; you’re not OK, but you will be.’Why is it so hard to admit that we are not OK, that we hurt, that we’re struggling? Logically we know that everybody struggles at sometime in their life, and yet when it’s us we worry about what people will think, we don’t want to be thought of as ‘weak’ or to ‘let people down’. Maybe we don’t want to admit our ‘weakness’ to ourselves.Here’s what I’ve learned: admitting that we’re not OK takes strength. If doing so were weak then it wouldn’t be so damned difficult. Confronting our fears, admitting that we need help – that takes strength and that is why it is often such a big step on the road to recovery, to taking some control over the situation and to dealing with it.Will other people think we’re weak? Maybe some will, but that speaks about them and not about us. We could all use help sometimes and during such times our priority should be in seeking it, in caring about what’s best for us and not the opinions and prejudices of others. And wouldn’t most of us want to be there for a friend or family member that needs us?At such times we really do see the best in people and we can really learn to appreciate the value with which others hold us. Sometimes what we see as weakness is actually just a characteristic of who we are, free from judgements such as ‘strong’ or ‘weak’. The very characteristics that hurt us may actually serve us well at other times, in other circumstances.We are all a mixture of weakness and strength, of resolve and vulnerability, and we will all face illness, heartbreak, grief, loss and confusion in our lives. The more willing we are to accept that then the more likely we are to be able to ask for help when we need it. This is important. As male suicide rates show, lives depend on it.As the now former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury admits that he needs help to deal with mental health problems maybe it’s time to truly recognise that even the biggest and strongest amongst us can feel broken and damaged sometimes.Admitting you’re not OK may be one of the hardest things you ever do; it is also one of the strongest.‘I’m not OK.’And that’s OK.Submitted by: Matthew

Coping with anxiety, depression and uni life
When I started university, I was completely oblivious to the fact I was suffering from clinical depression and anxiety. I’d always had a tendency to feel a bit more stressed out and upset than the average person, a trait which came to a head when I was 17; for the first two months of Year 13, I found myself feeling too low… Continue readingWhen I started university, I was completely oblivious to the fact I was suffering from clinical depression and anxiety. I’d always had a tendency to feel a bit more stressed out and upset than the average person, a trait which came to a head when I was 17; for the first two months of Year 13, I found myself feeling too low to eat, sleep, or function at all. However, I’d never had any formal education about mental health issues, and it wasn’t something that my family really talked about. I was resigned to the fact that I was probably just a silly, over-emotional person, and that I really just needed to pull myself together. I’d never been told otherwise; I had no idea that my low moods and anxious thoughts could be part of a medical condition. In my mind, it was all my fault, and I needed to just stop feeling the way I did.Then first year came along, and it became more and more apparent that something wasn’t quite right. People often underestimate just how emotionally draining it can be when you’re thrown into this totally new territory of lectures, seminars, formals, socials, and having to fend for yourself. Yes, it’s exciting, but it’s also an anxious person’s worst nightmare. You suddenly have to navigate making a whole new set of friends, looking after yourself both physically and emotionally, and getting used to the new academic system of lectures and seminars: what could possibly go wrong?! In the mind of an anxious or depressed person, the answer to that question is everything. You find yourself obsessing over everything that could possibly turn out badly for you, and, especially when you don’t have a formal diagnosis, you have no idea how to make all of those thoughts stop.In hindsight, depression and anxiety controlled almost every aspect of my life as a fresher. I struggled with work because the constant stream of negative thoughts and anxiety attacks made concentration a near impossibility. I struggled with making friends, because my depression was constantly telling me that it was a pointless endeavour- it wasn’t like anyone would want to be friends with someone as worthless as me. Going on a night out was out of the question: the mere thought of being in a crowd was enough to trigger a panic attack. But worse than any of this was the fact that nobody knew the extent to which I was struggling. I managed to project an image of someone who was calm, collected and basically fine, but then in second year, the façade began to crack.When depression and anxiety is left untreated, it’s like an avalanche hurtling down a mountain. It gains speed and it gains power until one day it comes crashing down, leaving destruction in its wake. My avalanche hit at the start of second year. The added stresses of living out only made my anxiety worse- you try staying calm when an estate agent tells you it’s your job to fix the boiler and restore hot water to your house EIGHT TIMES- and in the end, I simply ground to a halt, consumed by constant panic, inescapable low moods, and suicidal thoughts. The delicate balance I’d crafted between academia, social life, life in general and my emotional wellbeing just wasn’t working any more, and something had to change.While being at university undoubtedly made life more difficult depression-wise, it also provided the easiest access to help I’ve ever come across. After talking with college office, my department, a GP and the counselling service, I finally found a course of action that firstly helped me understand what I was actually going through, and then began to resolve it. Talking to someone- specifically, my senior tutor- was the best decision I’ve ever made regarding my illness. When I realised there were people out there that understood what I was going through and were willing to help, it took away some of the shame, the guilt, and, most importantly, the sense of isolation that depression can bring.A year on, I’m undoubtedly more emotionally well than I’ve ever been while at university. The road to recovery was a long and rocky road, but my story is the perfect testimony that things can get better. Things aren’t perfect- depression and anxiety will be with me for the rest of my life, and they still rear their unwanted heads at the most inopportune of times. But I’ve finally learned how to manage the combination of university life and living with a mental illness. We’re lucky at Durham that we have such a strong welfare support network, and I’m personally lucky to have such an amazing group of understanding friends and family. But there’s still a long way to go. There are still people out there who are too scared to ask for help, and still stigma that needs to be overcome. But the more we talk about mental illness, the more people will feel comfortable and supported enough to seek help. That’s why I decided to tell my story: if it makes even one person suffering from depression and anxiety that things can and do get better, it’s worth it.Submitted by: Ellie

Reindeer, Christmas Cookies and coping with anxiety at Christmas
Of course this year I will be organised and together.

I had visions of me sat in my cosy Christmassy living room, presents all bought and wrapped, feeling happy and excited about Christmas, typing away about how in the past my anxiety and stress levels have really ruined Christmas for me, but this year I have found the magic solutions and coping strategies that have made a real difference.And here I am on the 23rd December, just getting round to writing this, with nothing wrapped, presents still to buy and trying to remember how to breathe and not panic.The thing about me is that I struggle with anxiety, and it is worse when there is pressure on me to live up to other people's expectations or when my idea of 'how something is supposed to feel' doesn't live up to how it actually feels. It's quite common, I know, to feel like everyone else is enjoying a big Christmas party that you somehow missed the invite to, and I know social media can sometimes make this feeling worse.My general worries look a bit like this;a) every other parent has some sort of book titled 'how to make Christmas memories with your children' that I clearly missed out on in parenting school (imagine cover to cover advice on how to put Christmas Eve boxes together, where to find the Reindeer that suddenly appear in everyone's Facebook pictures, the best ways to bake Christmas cookies, afternoons of Christmas craft, special letters from Santa etc.). I really want Hannah and Emily (aged 10 and 8) to have great Christmas memories. I don't know where all the other parents find the time (or energy) to plan all that stuff! I know that the pressure I put on myself to make sure everything is perfect for them doesn't help me. I have such great memories of Christmas as a child and I really want that for them too. What if they are disappointed?b) see point a, and then add on a load of Mummy Guilt about working full time while the kids are off school, being separated from their Dad, which means for them Christmas Day is split in half and then trying to make up for it by promising myself I will plan in all the amazing Christmas activities so helpfully displayed by other parents on my Facebook feed (and then just not quite finding the time, or money, or energy) and feeling a bit worse.c) Everyone is having lots of Christmassy fun and there might be something wrong with me because I am usually too overwhelmed by all the things I have to do/buy/wrap to relax and enjoy it.On bad days I find the pressure of Christmas overwhelming, and this means that some days I feel so useless and inadequate that every negative thought I have ever had about myself runs through my head in a loop of worry and fear that I struggle to function properly. Other days I am pretty fine and crack on with the doing/shopping/wrapping and just about feel like I've got it all under control.If you're like me and have a tendency to worry, overthink things, strive for perfection and always feel like you fall a bit short, or generally find Christmas a stressful time, I don't have any magic answers. You are definitely not alone. Even the people who appear to be the most together and care free can be struggling on the inside. But when I can, I try and use mindfulness techniques to bring my mind back into that moment. I do breathing exercises. I talk to the people I trust about how I'm feeling. I exercise and lift heavy weights in the gym.It is just one week in the year and every year it passes and nothing bad happens, and I remind myself that soon it will be January and things will go back to normal.Of course I always know that next year I will be totally together. .and organised. . . .and less stressed. . . .and will definitely be posting pictures of my children sat on Reindeer whilst eating home-made Christmas cookiesSubmitted by: Michelle

Self-care tips for the festive season
Self-care has been a huge buzzword in 2016 and for good reason.

Too many of us work long hours, put others first and neglect our best interests every single day to the point where it can become a hindrance. The act of practising self-care isn’t an instant cure; instead it’s a commitment to showing yourself some love when you need it most. It’s a small part of recovery and can look different for each individual. Here’s my take on self-care over the party season…Make time for hobbiesWhen my days are jam-packed with visiting friends and family, I often don’t realise that I spend less time doing the things I love. Going to the gym, doing yoga and blogging are the things that really give me a sense of satisfaction so it’s essential that I make time over Christmas to fit those things in. When I stay with family I take my gym kit to make sure I can squeeze in a workout, and make sure my laptop is fully charged to make blogging on the quick and easy whenever I get some time to myself.Don’t be afraid to say noOver the festive period there are so many social engagements that we find ourselves fully booked and burning the candle at both ends. If like me, you already know you’re limits then you’re well-equipped to adjust your schedule accordingly. If you’re new to ‘saying no’ to stuff -we’ve all been there - then take a look at your calendar over the next few weeks. Are you busy several days in a row? Is it likely that might become stressful and affect your mood? If so, think about rearranging some social events to suit you; it’s OK to change plans especially if you give plenty of notice. Dinner and drinks can be coffee instead, and a night out can always become a cosy night in or even just a Skype call. Even consider rescheduling for January when you have more time.Get some fresh airI think we’re all guilty of staying inside more during winter, with the chill in the air and the dark nights providing the perfect excuse. If you can find the time on your days off I highly recommend going for a walk in the few hours of daylight that we do have in the British winter time, as this extra dose of vitamin D might just help boost your mood. Even a walk to the nearest coffee shop is a good way to sit down outside and watch the world go by. I like to use this time to try and disconnect from social media and simply observe how I’m feeling that day.Move moreExercise may not be your first love but I encourage you to try and incorporate some movement into your festive break. It can be a great excuse to escape the family home and have some alone time, as well as dust off the cobwebs from a few days snoozing on the sofa. Regular exercise can have a real impact on depression and anxiety. It can also lower stress levels and help your get a better night’s sleep. If the weather doesn’t allow you to go outside why not go for a swim or do some home yoga workouts on You Tube?Take yourself on a dateI know this may sound like a weird piece of advice, but during stressful times I think it’s really important that we treat ourselves well. If you knew someone who was feeling low, how would you take care of them? Do for yourself what you’d do for a close friend; go see that movie you’ve been meaning to see for weeks, draw a bubble bath or eat in your favourite restaurant. These little acts of self-care are key is remembering what makes you happy, and finding pleasure in the small things can keep you going.Submitted by: Fiona

How I spend my Christmas
While for a lot of people, Christmas is the best time of year to celebrate many things with their loved ones.

But here’s how I spend my Christmas.Don’t get me wrong I have always loved this time of year, nothing will stop me changing my mind however there’s some aspects I struggle with personally.I love the build up towards Christmas day. Sitting down and waiting for the Christmas ads to be released, all the new beauty being launched and the overall hype of it.While a lot of people are going out buying for their friends and family, there’s one person I cannot buy for. On Christmas Eve I used to love wearing a new set of Pj’s after a hot bath with a hot chocolate we all have our own Christmas Eve traditions but this was when I was little, it’s different now.On Christmas Eve, for me it’s like any other day. I’m usually working like a lot of people, I go home get sorted and visit my brothers resting place with family. Then, if I feel like it I go for a couple of drinks with my friends wearing Christmas jumpers.Christmas day will never be the same for me. The excitement has gone, not just because I’m older but because I have to open my presents, without the presence of my brother.The guilt of him not being here on this festive day feels strange and it’s hard to process yourself as being an only child this time of year. I know a lot of people feel the same this day, we have all lost loved ones and while we try to have a good time, we always miss them on this special day. After unwrapping my presents we always visit his place a couple of times that day then go home and relax. It kind of is like a normal day for me once I’ve opened my presents.As I say I love the whole concept of Christmas but when it comes to do the day, I don’t celebrate it like other families but that’s what makes us all different. It’s interesting how everyone spends this special day but for us it’s particularly hard, it always will be but we have our coping mechanisms to get us through it.While we all enjoy our Christmas, let’s all remember the angels who are no longer with us.Submitted by: Beth

'Tis the season to be jolly?
Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year!Rosy-cheeked children frolicking in the snow, men in Santa hats accompanied by their significant others wearing ridiculous (but fun) Xmas jumpers.

Buying gifts for those you love (and those you don’t) and the most important one of all, Church! Happy Birthday Jesus!No, seriously, it’s the receiving of gifts (for most).If, like me, you have recurring bouts of depression all year round, why is it that Xmas brings the worst one? Is it the social pressure? Is it financial worries? Is it the S.A.D.? Is it the expectation of happiness that you just can’t bring yourself to feel at this time of year, no matter how positive you force yourself to be?This year is probably going to be the toughest one yet for me and my family. We lost my Dad on the 10th November after a relatively short battle with MND. It was quick and unexpected and I won’t dwell on that story because although we’re all pretty heartbroken and saddened by the experience, it’s not a leading cause of depression for me. In case you don’t know, sadness and depression are only distant cousins!Every year we go through the motions of buying things we can’t afford, preparing a wonderful meal, spending our hard-earned cash on things, if we’re honest, we don’t really need.This year I’m going to spend something more important than money. I’m going to spend time. Time with my siblings and nephews, nieces, cousins and all the rest.I’m at the place where I can look outside myself and see in others what they’ve been seeing in me for most of my adult life. I see their half-hidden outward depression, I see their anxiety attacks covered up by laughing along numbly to the silly, harmless jokes in Christmas crackers. I see their non-existent appetite almost broken by a massive dinner they wouldn’t even attempt to eat at any other time of the year. I see them accepting a glass of wine or a beer, just to fit in, even though the medication they’re on prohibits it. Who says peer pressure is just for teens? Then falling hard into another post-festivities slump because their own expectations weren’t met, all the while asking themselves “What’s wrong with me?”I’m determined to make this Xmas about those who suffer in silence all year round, hoping against hope that Christmas will bring the joy they can’t feel out of them and into their community, their families and social groups.In my experience, the best Christmas gift for a fellow sufferer (or Warrior depending on the stage you’re at in your recovery) is the gift of an ear and the time needed to use it.I wonder who’s ear I’ll get for Xmas? I have enough socks.Submitted by: Declan

The importance of talking
Communication is key. We know this. This is something that is repeatedly said to us through our lives.

In school we are taught to talk to others, to work as a team, to tell our teacher if we have a problem. In relationships we know that communication is one of the most important aspects. All jobs require communication.We have to talk!So, why is it so difficult to talk about our mental health? This post will explore why talking about our problems, sharing our mental health issues, and listening to others can be amazing to help deal with mental illness.1) A problem shared is a problem halved.I’m not sure if this is actually proved, but I know for me, talking about my problems to someone else is like a huge weight off my shoulders. Sometimes that’s all I need to start feeling better.2) Different outlook. Sometimes talking to someone else can give you a different outlook. They may suggest something that you haven’t thought of, perhaps a new way of dealing with a problem, or just some kind words that help you look at a situation differently.3) Talking is a known and USED therapy for mental illness. There are so many talking therapies used for mental illness, from counselling, to cognitive behavioural therapy, to group counselling and mindfulness classes. I myself have had counselling and it certainly helped me. Often, when you see your GP about your mental health, they can recommend mindfulness classes or refer you for an assessment to see what talking therapy would suit you.4) Talking can help build confidence. Often with mental illness, some sufferers lack confidence. Talking can help this. The more you share your feelings with trusted friends, a partner, family, anyone, the more confident you will become. You may even feel confident to seek advice from a doctor if you need it and want it.Talking is often the first step to recovery when you suffer from mental illness, and it is so important that you don’t suffer alone. Please please share your problems. Even if your first step is writing it in a text, phoning a helpline, or bringing it up with a trusted friend. I promise that the support is out there for you.Never feel that you have to suffer alone.Submitted by: Rachel

We take part in this chat most Thursdays and it’s great to see how it's made a difference. Today she talks about how the change in seasons can affect our mental health and some tips to help with those winter blues.I usually find Winter to be quite difficult. Not only can the lack of sunlight be troublesome, but the Winter months seem to be full of events that trigger anxiety for me and when it gets to about September, I start to worry about the months to follow. First there’s Halloween, then there’s bonfire night, then there’s Christmas, then there’s new year. All this really means for me is more chance of getting ill and an added pressure to ‘go out and do things’ and be happy.Here are my tips for looking after your mental health in the Winter months.Try to keep at least some routine. I always find that the Festive season can be a bit troublesome because I have just over a week off work. I’m sure anybody else would absolutely love the idea of 10 days off but for me, the lack of routine makes things really difficult. I find that the days all blur together and I lose track of where I am and what I’m doing. This year I’ve tried to plan out some days so that I know exactly what I’m dealing with. I’m even going into work for two days!Do more of what you enjoy. As it gets darker and colder, a lot of us fall victim to the ‘Winter blues.’ When you suffer from a mental illness this becomes doubly difficult so at this time it’s really important to try to increase the amount of time spent on things that we actually enjoy doing. Going for walks, reading and writing are all things that I try to spend more time doing in Winter. I also find meditation really helpful, particularly when it comes to dealing with anxiety.Get enough sleep and water! I feel like we underestimate the value of getting enough sleep. I always find that after a bad night’s sleep I’m ten times more anxious the next day so I try to get at least eight hours every night anyway, but even more so in Winter. Don’t forget to stay hydrated and drink as much water as you can because all these things, although simple, do make a difference.Lamps and candles. Going to work when it’s dark and getting home when it’s dark can sometimes make you feel like you’re living in constant darkness so I find a bit of calm lighting really helpful. Lighting a few candles or using a lamp instead of a big light can help to create a less harsh, calmer atmosphere which can help me to relax.Take each day at a time and remember that every single day is a new chance and a new start. This is actually something that I remind myself of all year round. I have managed to teach myself that one bad day does not dictate a whole week. I know that when I go to sleep after an awful day, the morning will be brighter. Always try to see the ‘light at the end of the tunnel’ because it’s always there. Every single day, it’s there. Sometimes you just have to look a bit harder.Does anyone else find Winter particularly difficult? What are your tips?Submitted by: Hannah

Workplace depression
I personally have been badly affected by stress at work. I had to leave careers in the Law and teaching as a result of excessive workloads and a lack of support.

I had to leave careers in the Law and teaching as a result of excessive workloads and a lack of support. I have had three episodes of severe depression, all linked to workplace stress (one bout occurred after a redundancy). My most recent episode (in 2013) resulted in hospitalisation and Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT), which luckily worked for me. Over the years I’ve attempted suicide, had constant suicidal thoughts and felt guilty and ashamed about having depression. I didn’t understand why I couldn’t just do these jobs like my friends.As well as the problems at work, I also recognised some issues that I've had to work on and will continue to work on during my life. I was a perfectionist growing up and suffered from low self-esteem. I had to get A grades to feel good about myself, and when I didn’t make the grade I felt bad about myself. I pushed myself extremely hard during school, college and university to be the best, and when I left the education system it all came crashing down. I hadn’t really experienced failure, so I was-n't prepared for it when it happened in the real world. I linked my self-esteem to my job, and saw my job as my identity, which wasn’t healthy. I judged myself harshly and compared myself to others, and didn’t know how to love and take care of myself.I’ve been to hell and back, but I’ve learned a huge amount as a result of my experiences - I discovered a love of writing and blogging which has helped me through the difficult times. I now have a mental strength and determination that I didn’t have before. And I’m determined to help others who are suffering from work-related stress and depression. I’m launching a web-site (staysaneatwork.co.uk) where people affected can find resources to help them to recover, information about workplace laws and employee rights and an inspirational blog which will feature stories of those who have been through workplace depression and come out of the other side.I also want to provide information about self-employment, as often things get so bad that sufferers cannot envisage going back to work. Last year I became self-employed as a Copywriter and more recently a Coach, and I love helping others to leave employment behind and become self-employed. I realised after the third bout of depression that, for me, working for others was like trying to put a square peg into a round hole. It was never going to work! I am much happier now that I’m working for myself, and if I can help others to make that leap and use my experiences to help them that would be fantastic.I’m also passionate about raising awareness about the workplace depression, as well as work/life balance and self-care. If the younger generation learn how to look after themselves and make sure they have balance in their lives, many cases of work-place depression can be prevented. Prevention is better than cure, and my aim is do talks in Secondary Schools, Colleges and Universities about my experiences and how to avoid letting work take over your life, and making you ill.There is a lot of work to be done but life is so much easier when you’re passionate about your work - and now I know what I’m here to do I am ready for the challenge! Half of the battle is working out your “why” - what you’re passionate about and what you’re here to do. Many of us get stuck in what I call our ‘default life’ - a job we end up in that pays the bills and is ok, but it doesn’t set your soul on fire. My work relies heavily on spirituality and personal development, which I discovered as a result of my illnesses. I’ve learned (the hard way) that life’s too short to settle for anything!Submitted by: Debbie

Really really hard. Additionally sometimes, you know what, we don't even know what's going on. How can you talk about what's going on with you when you have no idea?Given the stigma that surrounds mental health maybe you have never talked about mental health before, because well, most people still don't until it affects them. Then your in a situation were you're being affected by mental health, you don't know who to talk to. You don't know how to talk about it. You have a lack of knowledge, understanding, confidence and your dealing with this strange illness of the mind.Did I mention that by this stage, you have likely been dealing with your mental health illness for some time. So yer, your not in a great place.You have gradually started to isolate yourself from friends and family. Finding a combination of doubts and worries prevent you from talking out about your experiences and concerns.No one you know has ever talked about about mental health, depression or self harm in any great detail (at all actually).This is pretty much the situation I found myself in. Fortunately I live in a time when we have the internet. It's not just a place where you can search for medical 'help' on Web MD or NHS (or the other stuff, you know what I mean haha). Thanks to social media platforms I was and am able to find / talk to people with similar experiences to myself. People I would never have met without the internet, and twitter in particular.These people have become friends, some, very close friends.I wanted to write this post because of the support I have found online. The difference it has made to me and the importance of groups like the ones I'll talk about, in breaking down stigma, raising awareness and being a support system to so many people.The groups I would like to mention specifically are: The Depression Army, #MentalHealthHR and #TalkMH.These are obviously not the only groups out there. There are many more each day and that's great.The groups I am mentioning are specifically ones that I have benefited from being part of.The Depression Army, I found the group on twitter and then on facebook. The DA encourages people to talk and take part in awareness raising activities. As a member of this group I have shared messages of support online and in my workplace.The DA is based in America, with members all over the world. There are links on most social media platforms. For me I've found this to be a great way to provide people with little gifts of positivity and help put a smile on their faces.#MentalHealthHR, this group I really like because I found it the first or second week it was started running. So I feel like I've got to see it grow, which has been awesome. Starting off with 2 or 3 people in the conversation as you talk through points is so interesting and different to the larger groups I've seen. I'm sure this group will be a big one soon so I've enjoyed there from the start. The twitter chat happens Mondays 8pm to 9pm and was created by Doris. The chat focuses on different aspects of mental health each week, it's a great way to talk about what's going on in a positive, open, non judgmental space.#TalkMH, as you can tell I love the twitter social interaction. This twitter chat is Thursdays 8.30pm to 9.30pm and was created by Hannah and is guest hosted about 5 out of 6 weeks. This group is awesome! There are set topics each week, with guest hosts that have requested to host on that topic. The diversity in hosts helps to bring in different people to the chat each week. It also means it's not just about support. There's also a great opportunity to learn about mental health illnesses, challenges, coping strategies and achievements. I have certainly learnt from others experiences and feel more informed and supported each week.I have also been know to drop in on #BPDchat and #TKSP both chats again provide support to those affected by mental health illnesses, while #BPDchat is more specifically for Borderline Personality Disorder.As I said, it's so hard to talk when you don't know what's going on. But these groups / chats don't require you to 'know'. They allow you the opportunity to talk openly with others that have been affected by or have an interest in mental health. Though saying that everyone I've spoken to in the chats has been affected.I encourage you to look at these chats, look for others, find something that works for you. That's the beauty in the ever growing online social world. You don't even have to talk if you don't want to. You could just read other people's tweets or posts.I have found this to be a great way to be more informed, give and receive support and to just talk about what's going on. Not to mention the friends I've made.I hope your able to find something that works for you. We are all different and so are our mental illnesses. But understanding and caring for each other is the thing we can all have in common.Submitted by: Mike

Living and coping with Anxiety
Anxiety is one of the most common mental illnesses; it affects 1 in 3 people. How would I know this? It’s because I suffer from anxiety. I would class my anxiety as “high functioning”. I have days where I’m completely fine and I feel myself, I also have days where I feel over whelmed and my anxiety can feel out of… Continue readingAnxiety is one of the most common mental illnesses; it affects 1 in 3 people. How would I know this? It’s because I suffer from anxiety. I would class my anxiety as “high functioning”. I have days where I’m completely fine and I feel myself, I also have days where I feel over whelmed and my anxiety can feel out of control.My anxiety first came about during Year 11, where the stresses of going my GCSES triggered my anxiety. I would wake up every day feeling incredibly tense, nauseous and shaky. It felt like hundreds of butterflies had settled in my tummy. This wasn’t just a one off thing. This feeling lasted nearly every day and I began to feel overwhelmed.I then moved onto college and my anxiety slowly became worse. I had lots of days where I would feel overwhelmed and I struggled to have normal conversations with people, as I couldn’t keep the conversations going and I became paranoid. It got the point where I started to suffer from anxiety attacks.Whilst my attacks aren’t anywhere as serious as a panic attack, they were incredibly distressing and would often leave me feeling trapped and as if they would go on forever.However anxiety is far more complex than what I’ve described above. It’s having a million thoughts racing around in your head constantly and never been able to quieten your mind.It’s constantly worrying about the physical symptoms of anxiety “I feel like I’m going to be sick” “I’m shaking, everybody will notice”. It’s having this overwhelming fear that something bad will happen and not being able to let go of this fear.I’ve found suffering from anxiety challenging as I don’t want to have a constant battle with myself, I don’t want a million thoughts racing around my head or worrying when I’m next going to have an anxiety attack.Over the past couple of years, I come up with a range of coping mechanisms to help me cope with my anxiety and to help me get my anxiety under control.1. Acceptance: I’ve come to accept that my anxiety is a long term thing that won’t magically go away overnight. I’ll have good days and I’ll have bad days. By putting things into perspective it’s given my confidence that I can get through the bad days and it won’t last forever.2. CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy): Just over a year ago I had CBT to help me cope with my anxiety and it really helped me. My counsellor went over my anxiety symptoms, helped me to understand why I felt the way I did and gave me strategies to help me cope and keep my anxiety under control.3. Talk to someone: When my anxiety is really bad I always talk to someone I trust about how I'm feeling. It really helps talking to someone as it gets it off your chest and they often give you their advice on how to cope. Having someone that will listen to you and tries to understand how you’re feeling, always makes me feel better.4. Mindfulness: Whilst helping me through a bad patch with my anxiety, one of my teachers taught me mindfulness as a way to help me cope with my anxiety. Mindfulness is all about focusing on being in the present moment and being non-judgemental of your thoughts. I’ve been practising mindfulness and it’s a great way for helping you cope with anxiety.5. Exercise: I’ve found that doing exercise has helped me to take my mind off things and I feel so good afterwards, like I've lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. Exercise gives me something to focus on and it helps me to relax. As well as helping me cope with anxiety, I’ve also had the added bonus of becoming much fitter.Submitted by: Severina

The stigma of Anorexia
The main problem with mental health is that so many people around you, won’t know you’re suffering. In a word of social media and selfies, no one wants to project an image of themself that is anything less than perfect. And that’s just part of the problem…Society puts so much pressure on young girls to look, dress and… Continue readingThe main problem with mental health is that so many people around you, won’t know you’re suffering. In a word of social media and selfies, no one wants to project an image of themself that is anything less than perfect. And that’s just part of the problem…Society puts so much pressure on young girls to look, dress and act a certain way. I’m lucky that I grew up on the cusp of social media, and wasn’t really affected by the pressures that teenagers face today. And for the that, I’m so grateful! However I was still exposed to all the celebrities and models in the media, and the pressure to look like the prettier, skinnier girls in my year.With the weight and significance of other people’s opinions that young girls face, there is no wonder how easily mental illnesses can develop.When I was 15/16, I developed Anorexia. After being quite a big child, I decided it wasn’t a way I wanted to be for the rest of my life. At first, it was just simply making healthy choices. However, my portions eventually become smaller and smaller, to ultimately I was barely eating and a tiny size 4. I had constant arguments with my family, and my friends were beginning to make comments. After my periods stopped for 4 months, I knew I just couldn’t carry on punishing my body like this. Luckily I managed to change my relationship with food on my own.However, I don’t think anorexia is something that ever fully goes away. And to this day, I still can’t weight myself.Since then, I have become quite insecure as a person. My friends tell me it’s in my head, and how can I be a blogger and be as insecure as I am? But toxic friendships, relationships and situations, then combined with a teenage eating disorder, really has had knock on effect on me as person. I’ll moan to my friends when I’ve had a drink, being like don’t you think blah blahs prettier than me, and don’t you think she’s got a nice figure? But that is just what I’m like to my friends, because to me, confidence is attractive and insecurity is weakness. So I’d rather present myself to the world in a way that I’m not…Or I don’t think I’d get anywhere in life.But I do feel like blogging puts so much pressure on me as a person. I really really want the perfect body, like the one so many of the Instagram bloggers have. Which to be honest, probably isn’t healthy outlook considering everything what I’ve just spoke about. But I do feel sorry for my friends who’ve helped me work on my blog. My friend Beth pretty much proof reads every blog post, just so I feel like the content is good enough. And my friends Katy and Cathryn have had to take literally about a hundred photos of me. Just so I can find one with where I think the angle doesn’t make my head look too round, or my thighs look really fat. But when you’re putting yourself out there as a blogger, you do want the best photos and you do want the best content, and it’s hard.But I have had a lot of friends who’ve suffered a distorted relationship with food and their body image too. With anorexia, bulimia or over eating, each one being as detrimental as the other. Through ignorance you can tell someone to eat a salad, or a few burgers, but it’s really just not helpful.If you don’t understand something, don’t let ignorance get the better of you. You’ll only do more damage then good.I’ve also got friends who’ve developed really bad distorted insecurities, just because someone has made them feel that way. Off the cuff comments can do more damage than you think, and if you care about someones opinion or approval, you will take what they say on board. So it’s not fair to make someone feel like they’re not good enough.The last thing I want to talk about is panic and anxiety attacks. I started having them when I was 17, in a period where I was really upset and stressed. A few of my friends suffer with the attacks too, some even find them very distressing. However, after the first one where I got rushed to A&E ’cause I thought I was dying…they really don’t bother me anymore. I’ll be laid in bed watching telly, and I’ll just have one for no reason whatsoever. But as long as I can control my breathing, which 99% of the time I can, I’ll stay calm and wait for it to end. To me, it’s just part of life and there’s nothing I can do about it.I think the best thing to do if you feel like me, is just to talk to your friends. My friends around me are so amazing, and they’ve got me through everything. And we’ve even come out laughing…eventually! I don’t think ‘mental health’ is anything abnormal. There’s no such thing as normal. Everyone’s coping methods and outlook on life is different.There shouldn’t be any stigmas.Submitted by: Lucy

Anxiety nearly ruined my life
We all get anxious from time to time, whether it's an exam, argument or just meeting new people but what about the individuals who have chronic anxiety on a daily basis? The people who struggle to get out of the bed in the morning and can't leave the house for no reason at all? Research shows that 1 in 6 young people will… Continue readingWe all get anxious from time to time, whether it's an exam, argument or just meeting new people but what about the individuals who have chronic anxiety on a daily basis? The people who struggle to get out of the bed in the morning and can't leave the house for no reason at all? Research shows that 1 in 6 young people will suffer from anxiety at some point in their lifetime, and it usually starts in childhood or adolescence. That is a lot of people so why is the concept of anxiety so misused? I'm an anxiety sufferer, and this is my story.From that picture, I look like a normal teenage girl, don't I? Looking back, I was an anxious child, but I never thought anything of it, I'm a worrier, and I worry if I'm not worrying (Bet it took you a moment to work that out). It's stupid, I know but something that I cannot control. If a friend had a birthday party or I had a big day ahead of me at school, my mind would be filled with negative thoughts, at the time that's okay to you so you just deal with it.Mental health is something that isn't picked up on enough; it's dismissed because it isn't visible. In February 2015 I went to the doctors after becoming severely anxious over every tiny thing in my life. I had a lot of stressful situations going on, from exams to family problems and I thought I was coping, but my body couldn't take it anymore. I wrote a list of symptoms down because I had so many and felt so anxious that I couldn't speak, just trying to do my relaxation exercises that I'd found online. My doctor experience wasn't pleasant; I was looked down upon and felt like no one believed me because I'm young and of course "young people don't have anything to worry about". However, I managed to get a referral to counselling (CAMHS) and got a doctors note to prove I was too unwell to attend school which was another barrier I had to face.It was exam period, and there was a lot of work to catch up on, school was banging on my front door every day, demanding me to do more and more work and asking me when I would next be in school, arranging meetings and constant phone calls. This was way too much for me, I didn't need this, and it proved that the education system only cares about themselves so they look good. I tried to revise and complete the work given to me, but sometimes it made me too ill, my heart pounding, my breathing getting faster. I did miss my exams due to anxiety, but I tried my hardest not to get upset because your health is so much more important than a piece of paper.My first panic attack is something I'd never want to relive, I've learnt how my body reacts to anxiety now, however, they can still be incredibly terrifying. I remember it like it was yesterday, I was sitting in a restaurant with Lewis in Meadowhall, and I felt fine until I realised the more I ate, the more anxious I became. I felt so distant from everyone, so on edge, I couldn't stand up or speak. I was so scared; I needed to escape. Fast. My brain was going into overdrive, I was uncontrollably shaking, an intense amount of pain making me numb. My chest tightened and I started to breathe faster to the point of hyperventilation; I ran out of the restaurant and into the nearest toilet where I threw up. Why was this happening? Was I dying? I was a wreck, and I just needed to get out of there.Luckily for me, Lewis managed to take me to a quieter place to calm me down but even afterwards I felt shaken up, I had no idea what just happened but I knew that I never wanted to experience it again. Unfortunately, that attack was one of many, in fact, I had them every time I needed to leave the house to the point where I became agoraphobic.For a while, I had to deal with everything on my own, yeah my family was there, but they knew as much as me about what was going on. The referral for counselling took forever, but I finally started my sessions in October 2015. My counsellor was a lady called Janet, who at first I wasn't sure about, I didn't want to be there, I just wanted to be better. However, she was very nice and looked after me, and we just talked about what my anxiety is like, and she set me little tasks to try and complete that would be a step forward in my recovery. Anxiety is all about pushing past those barriers; you have to take control of it.In May 2016 I got referred to CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). I now see a man called John, this therapy is more detailed, trying to find out what my brain does when I'm anxious and to look into how to stop it. The sessions are draining, I admit that, but I'm determined to beat this. I have Panic Disorder, Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Borderline Agoraphobia so it's going to be a real challenge.I still get panic attacks every time before I leave the house to go out but I've learnt how my body deals with my symptoms, and now it feels a lot easier to control. Of course, I get good and bad days, but I wouldn't wish mental health upon anybody. I'm now able to go out a lot more, and I'm slowly starting to become my old self, however, I'm still not in any education, but it's all about baby steps. Social media portrays an appalling image in any form of anxiety/depression, posting images that make it seem that everyone has got it. It's not cute; it's hell.I'm always here for support, my email address is sugarcoathope@gmail.com if you would like to talk. We will beat this together.Submitted by: Hope

My Anxiety tool kit
6 months ago I was discharged from hospital for the 3rd time, this time after an overdose. These 6 months has almost been the most challenging part of my journey. It scared me.

These 6 months has almost been the most challenging part of my journey. It scared me. Made me realise how out of control things were and something seriously needed to be done. I had been in and out of hospital for 2 years with anxiety and depression, but this was the point it hit home.Putting life back together after 2 years is scary and anxiety provoking. You learn so much about yourself during this experience you come out the other end a different person, with different values; which make it even harder to adjust back into life as it was.Everything is a challenge. Things most would not blink an eye at doing; such as re-connecting with friends, getting on public transport, sometimes just leaving the house. To deal with anxiety-provoking events I was taught coping mechanisms to use rather than reaching straight to medication or self-harm.If I am anxious I use mindfulness to help ground me and try to switch off negative thoughts I may be having. I use many breathing techniques, my favorite (which is quite common) is putting one hand on my chest, the other on my belly and taking a deep breath in for 5 seconds, out for 7 seconds and repeating this over and over, imagining there is a balloon in your tummy. Another favorite is body scanning, working down from your head to toes paying attention to how each part is feeling.There is one thing I cannot go out without which is my anxiety tool kit. This features something to stimulate each of the senses to distract from the thoughts and feelings being experienced. In my tool kit I have a stress ball, super sour sweets and olbas oil. Even the where these are kept is tactile. On my phone I have photos that remind me of happy times and music, which is an amazing distraction I use all the time, without music going out would be a struggle.The background image on my phone I have my coping card. This reminds me of my tools if everything goes blank during a panic attack – it is always there, on hand ready to use. It reminds me of all the things contained in my tool box.When I am at home I doodle. This is something I started doing in my first stay in hospital. It was something I could do for myself, not judgmentally and something to concentrate on. In a way it has become my own form of mindfulness.Everyone has their own ways of dealing with their anxiety, I wanted to share mine for people who do not know what simple tools can be used. I hope it can be of help, if only it is to one person.Submitted by: Emma

How Blogging changed my life
For a decade now, I have had to deal with some things that I didn't handle well at all.Amongst other things, I was getting bullied at secondary school and at home and for someone who was in their early teens, growing up, meeting new people, finding out and trying new things etc, all I was doing was hurting.I was… Continue readingFor a decade now, I have had to deal with some things that I didn't handle well at all.Amongst other things, I was getting bullied at secondary school and at home and for someone who was in their early teens, growing up, meeting new people, finding out and trying new things etc, all I was doing was hurting.I was hurting inside whilst I was happy on the outside. I was turning to food to give me comfort and this in turn gave me a certain low level of happiness but some ease none the less.But I had no real sense of happiness anymore. I was absolutely, completely and utterly lost.To make it even worse, I didn't tell anyone about the bullying and about how I was feeling and even now that is my biggest mistake and regret I have made. It caused me to have really bad anxiety that meant I couldn't leave the house because I was so self conscious of what people would say, get paranoid and all of my emotions got out of hand and I couldn't deal with it.I was a really negative girl in what I thought was a really negative world.But oh, how I was wrong.Over the past couple of years, I am at the point where I am slowly but surely accepting myself, flaws and all, and becoming hopefully a much happier person.This is mainly due to finding a passion in blogging.It has given me a sense of guidance in a way, where I am finding out things about myself that I would have hidden five years ago and a platform where I can be myself whilst letting go of all the anger and negativity. Most importantly, blogging has taught me how to talk about things and how to get pass that fear of being judged. It has taught me that it is ok not to be ok.If you start blogging or just opening up more to people, do it. Have a talk with them. Scream, cry (god knows how many times I have cried when writing a blog post). Or put your feelings into words onto an online space. I have finally realised that there are people who will support you and look after you no matter what you are feeling and thinking.Mental health affects more people than you probably think. You aren't alone in this, you never have and you never will be. This is why it is so important to do something I didn't do, start talking about it.nobody should face a mental health problem alone, and we want to be there *every* day, for anyone who needs us. This day recognises what support there is out there for people, but most importantly for people to be mindful every day!Submitted by: Caroline

Self-Care for Mental Illness
Mental illness is really bloody hard. Unless you’ve been through it, you won’t really have any understanding as to what it’s like. Heck, even when suffering, you have no idea what another person is going through. All you can really do is empathise. But, I’ll try and do a different post on how to help someone with mental… Continue readingMental illness is really bloody hard. Unless you’ve been through it, you won’t really have any understanding as to what it’s like. Heck, even when suffering, you have no idea what another person is going through. All you can really do is empathise. But, I’ll try and do a different post on how to help someone with mental illnesses in the future. For now, I’ll stick to self-care. Obviously, this won’t work for everyone, but in the past eight years, you could say I’ve tried a lot of different things, read a lot of different books and websites, talked to lots of different people and these are what work for me.1. RestRest is the greatest tool for any type of illness. If you have a common cold, the first thing you’re told is to get as much rest as possible to allow your body to repair itself, that’s what it’s there for. Why should the brain not get the same attention? I recently read a book called ‘Depressive Illness‘ by Dr. Tim Cantopher who recommends rest very strongly, and I wholeheartedly agree.No one quite knows exactly how the brain works yet, which is why there are so many different treatments for the vast array of mental illnesses, but recuperating in a safe place can’t be the worst thing to do at all. Making sure that I’m safe and well, however long that takes, is the easiest and safest option I have. In basic terms, sleep is a bloody life-saver and will help you so much.2. Binging NetflixI’m renowned for watching TV series in a matter of days, often repeatedly. It may seem to an outsider that this is because I bloody love Orange is the New Black (for the record – I do). That’s not the main reason though. It blocks out all the bad stuff that tries to control my life. It helps me to try and focus – albeit not very well, hence the rewatching – on something other than what my brain is telling me, all the insecurities and anxieties and thoughts that may try and enter. I’ll admit, it doesn’t always work at blocking things out, but it serves it’s purpose most of the time. If finding out what happens to Walt White in Season 5 of Breaking Bad blocks out the darkness, even just for 47 minutes, I’m 100% down with that.3. ReadingSimilar to the last point, reading blocks everything out. I’ve always been one of those readers who gets lost in a book and has to finish it the same day (probably why I’ve read more this year than any other year since I was about 10). It’s a method of escapism from your own mind. I literally can’t think of anything else but the book I’m reading and that is excellent, I honestly couldn’t wish for anymore – except obviously when the book finishes and I get that empty void (until the next one). If you want to see what I’m reading at the moment, you can add me on Goodreads. Basically, reading shuts out EVERYTHING and doesn’t allow for anything else – which is great if that’s what you’re aiming for.4. MusicNow, this is a tricky one. I have a lot of songs that really trigger me, and I’ve learnt that it’s fine to listen them to get out all those emotions that I need to get out at the time. But not all the time. Music can be really helpful though, and I’m trying to focus on the good songs that pull you out of that awful place. Arctic Monkeys (fave band ever!) always seem to get me into a great mood however I’m feeling, they’ve saved my life countless times. *Also recommend 60s Soul for pulling you out of any dark place and feeling like you’re on top of the world.* It doesn’t matter what time of day, where I am, who I’m with – all you need to do is pop in your earphones and everything can change. I guess that’s the whole point of music, to make you feel something, whether it be sadness, happiness or pumped for life.5. ProjectsI don’t care what your project is. When I came out of hospital, I started the #100DaysOfMakeup on Instagram because it meant that for 100 days, I had to do something every single day. It wasn’t to showcase my makeup abilities or anything like that, it was a reason to stay alive. I set myself a challenge and had to accomplish it, because I’m just that stubborn. My new project is going to be painting my bedroom. Your project could be anything, from collecting all the Pokémon on Pokémon Go (gotta catch ’em all and all that) to making sure you brush your teeth twice a day for the next 10 days, it can be literally anything. It gives you a reason to be here, it gives you a reason to persevere against those bad thoughts. Whatever you want to do, go for it, there’s no reason not to and you CAN do it.6. A BathThis is probably the heading that sounds the most boring, I agree. Though, when you’re at your worst, bathing doesn’t seem like the most essential thing. Do it. Have a bath, throw in that Lush bath bomb you were saving for a special occasion, borrow your mother’s bath salts if you have to. You deserve it, your body that’s keeping you going – despite your brain’s attempts to salvage it – deserves it. Whilst soaking your body, you’ll find it does wonders to your mind as a pleasant side-effect.7. AvoidanceAvoidance isn’t the best tactic in the world, and shouldn’t be the one you turn to for the long term. But it helps me. Avoiding things, places, people, anything that I know will trigger me and keep me safe is one of the most important pieces of self-care I’ve learnt. Would I (my friends, my family, anyone) prefer to be in somewhere they find comfort or somewhere where they know they could relapse/breakdown/not be very comfortable at all? Obviously the former – if you chose the latter, you’re a little daredevil and I very strongly admire you. Taking care of yourself, first and foremost, is the most important thing, because when you get down to it, if you’re not there then there really isn’t any point. Saying this, I regularly push myself out of my comfort zone – even if it’s just to go into town alone and reward myself with a Starbucks sugar-free vanilla soya latte. But, if you know it will cause you harm, just don’t do it. If you need to avoid it because it will make you worse, then avoid it, no point in harming your own recovery.8. Support NetworkFor a long time, I didn’t feel like I had any support network at all. I’d barricaded myself in my safe place, my room, for so long that I felt like I’d lost everything, everyone. Slowly, I’m trying to reconnect with the people I’d shut out for so long and that’s making me feel a lot better. You’ll realise that people want to help and care for you. I know that blackness in your mind says that you’re not worth it but if you try, people will understand (except from those who are so ignorant – but you don’t need those in your life anyway). Even if you feel there is no one you can speak to, or that you don’t want anyone to know what you’re feeling, you can email me at megrrees@gmail.com or tweet me, no judgement and I’ll try and reply as soon as possible. People do care for you and want to support you as much as possible.Submitted by: Megan

Gardening has definitely been my saviour
I wanted to share with you what discovering gardening has done for me since I've began my education in this fabulous hobby.

I shall try keep it short as to not to bore you but I hope it may be of some use.So as a typical busy on the go mum & wife getting wrapped up in everyday chores and responsibilities I started to become a bit lost with myself. I can do mum quite well (most of the time when they aren't making me yell or despair) and I can do being Mrs W good too but being Nichola, well I didn't really know how to! I didn't really have anything to escape to or have a hobby that kept me engaged enough (like my 2 year old boy I get bored easy!). Things came to a crunch when I hit my lowest point I had ever been. Things at home weren't great with Mr.W losing a job and wondering how on earth we would cope and trying to keep the family happy just became all a bit too much. I cried lots, I over thought a LOT, and I just couldn't see any light at all. Thankfully a little hope was thrown our way when Mr.W managed to get a new job, great so the 'normal' functions of family life could start to get back on track but I knew that I had to find something for me to do where I could switch off from being mum & wife.Hello gardening! I can't really remember exactly how it started but I had a pack of seeds (Cosmos Versailles Tetra) I'd gotten free from a magazine and thought "Oh I'll give it a go and hope for the best!" Wow I couldn't believe I had managed to not kill them. They actually became the start of my obsession. Every day I got up I would check on them, soon as I returned home they would be checked again. Then when the first flower bud appeared I was elated. What a proud moment I had (sounds a bit pathetic haha) but it was like nurturing a baby-minus the sleepless nights and smelly nappies! So a few more different seeds were sown with success which helped me create my fabulous hanging baskets, and well the rest as they say was history. I had something that I could be good at for ME that gave ME satisfaction and made ME happy.A Very happy NicholaThe lovely thing about gardening is there's always something to learn regardless of experience or age and I love to learn. I got a fab bunch of books off Mum-who is a very good gardener, which I read lots to get to grips with and find rather fascinating. I've got some lovely friendly people on Twitter who offer fantastic advice when you need it too all from different backgrounds. The other nice things are it gives you escapism from everyday woes and offers you down time to reevaluate life's little trivia’s. It gets you outdoors and out with nature, yes even if it rains a little. It's a good bit of exercise but it's the best for giving you mindfulness & hope! For me it's helped me be Nichola again with extra happiness & a new lease of life.Submitted by: Nichola

The Power of Friends with Stripes
This is the story of why, while recovering from depression and anxiety, I carried around with me a plastic zebra figure, which takes some explaining, so let me make a start …Depression can be a lonely place; one where, as well as battling with ourselves, we might also struggle to explain to others how we’re feeling.… Continue readingThis is the story of why, while recovering from depression and anxiety, I carried around with me a plastic zebra figure, which takes some explaining, so let me make a start …Depression can be a lonely place; one where, as well as battling with ourselves, we might also struggle to explain to others how we’re feeling. Our worlds can get smaller as we feel less like getting out and about and we can end up seeing fewer people except that handful of people, who make us feel understood, who take our concerns seriously, and who we often come to rely on.Then there come those good days, when even though we’re still feeling vulnerable the idea of tackling a long postponed activity, visiting a friend, or simply sitting on a bench and feeling the fresh air on our skin, starts to have an appeal. And at those times it’s not always practical, appropriate, or necessary for us to take a friend or family member along with us which can be both freeing and frightening.But what if we had a secret back-up to help us approach those moments with a little added confidence? What if we could find a calm, constant, non-judgemental companion who wouldn’t leave our sides, who could help us concentrate when things got a bit wobbly, who could reassure us that no, we aren’t going to die, we’re going to breathe slowly, get through this, and then get home for tea and biscuits unharmed.What if that someone, that calming friend, could fit in our bag or pocket so no one around would know they were there? And what if that someone wasn’t a someone at all … but rather a plastic zoo animal?It can happen. In fact it did happen, to me, around 20 years ago when me and ‘Zebra’ (as I so creatively named him) came to be firm friends.I was a teenager whose body and mind, for various reasons, just decided “No thanks. We’re not doing this” after two days of college, leading to my dropping out of education and down into the long bumpy and dimly lit helter-skelter ride of depression for around four years.He was a 5cm striped plastic toy, a surprise gift bought for me by my boyfriend to act as a companion, a protector, a pocket talisman. (And, *Spoiler Alert* it’s now over 20 years later and I’ve kept them both.) It was a wonderful, caring, gesture, but why a plastic zebra?That part came from a story a teacher friend told my sister about how she’d noticed one little girl in her class carried a toy zebra with her everywhere she went. The teacher recognised the girl was using it as a comforter, something to help her through the daunting task of starting school, but when she raised the issue with the girl a different story emerged."Is he looking after you?" asked the teacher."No ... I'm not scared." replied the little girl, "He is. I'm looking after him".And that was it; as simple as that. By acting as if she was protecting her little striped friend, the girl could face the scary prospect of life in the big wide world. My partner took the chance that, in buying me my own plastic pal, a similar focus would be passed on to me. If my own stripy guy was scared of facing the world alone, so how could I leave him behind? He needed me. I was the brave one in the relationship.As I gradually worked my way up into the light of day, (with the help of anti-depressants and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), I made each tiny step along the way with a zebra for company.I kept him safe, in my pocket, while I went for walks to the end of the road and back to see how it felt to be outside alone.He became my travelling companion when I managed to start taking trips by bus, after which I let him come to college with me, and then university, and later he lived in my work bag when I got my first real job. For a few years after that he continued to accompany me to every scary new place and social occasion in between and he’s even been loaned out to relatives who’ve kept him company while in hospital.And now? Well now he’s a bit scuffed and battle scarred, but which of us isn’t? And, as I’ve not called upon his services for a while, I’ve allowed him to retire, alongside the collection of other striped friends I’ve acquired over the years.He now lives above the desk in my office where he’s a daily reminder that I can do scary things.If you are struggling, or you know someone who is, then I can highly recommend seeking out a stalwart stripy companion.Traditional therapies and caring friends and family play a vital role in helping support people with depression and anxiety, but I firmly believe plastic zebras have their place too: in your pocket, your hand and, ultimately, after all you’ll go through together, they’ll also have a place in your heart.Submitted by: Julie

Self-help from a person whose experienced it for years
Depression and anxiety can be one horrible thing to go through. Questioning yourself, putting yourself down, self-sabotaging. You want to help yourself, but the other half of you doesn't and will fight you if you try. Because I've been through it all a lot over the years, I understand it can be a constant battle but have… Continue readingDepression and anxiety can be one horrible thing to go through. Questioning yourself, putting yourself down, self-sabotaging. You want to help yourself, but the other half of you doesn't and will fight you if you try. Because I've been through it all a lot over the years, I understand it can be a constant battle but have picked up techniques to help.Feelings Of Helplessness/HopelessnessYou feel absolutely useless, worse than anybody else. Nobody could possibly mess up as much as you, right? WRONG. There are many people, just like you struggling through their own problems. Don’t measure yourself against others. Some people are good at putting on an air of success, happiness and confidence, it doesn't mean they are. Most show the world what they want them to see. You're awesome! And you need to tell yourself that a hell of a lot more.You have 2 sides of your mind. You’re conscious and you’re subconscious. The conscious is the voice in your head telling yourself that you're useless, it feeds your subconscious with whatever you allow it to. The subconscious can be more powerful. Your subconscious is where your actions tend to manifest themselves. So the best way of fighting this is to remember the "voice in your head". We all talk to ourselves whether we realise it or not. Keep telling yourself you're useless, and your subconscious will believe it and manifest it in your life. But if you become more aware of these "voices" or thoughts then you're already on the way to helping yourself. Every time any negativity pops up, you need to pounce on that bad lad before your subconscious gets to it. Tell yourself “NO!” and Combat it with some pre-planned positive thoughts.If you don't believe it, don’t worry, originally it’s about thinking it anyway. Say it out loud. Write it down. Look at it and think it CONSTANTLY.Loss of Interest In Daily ActivitiesYou wake up in the morning and just can’t be bothered to interact or do anything. But we both know it’s not good for you. And you aren’t going to let it beat you.If you went to climb a mountain, you’re aware you're not superman and can't just jump to the top. Don't expect too much from yourself from day one. A doctor once told my dad when he was suffering with depression, "even if you just clean a cup that day, do it, do it well and be happy you've done it". So even if you just get up and do something small, if it’s more than you would have done, its progress. Set your own "tiny targets" to begin with, and each thing you achieve, be proud, its progress! Well done you! I hope you've got long arms because you need to pat yourself on the back. YOU'RE AWESOME! Eventually your subconscious believes whatever you tell it, the same way liars can convince themselves that they're telling the truth, only you will be!Appetite And Weight ChangesOne that I personally am struggling with the most at the moment. No appetite most of the time, so don't eat as much as I should. For some it will be the opposite. It is very common when you're low for your appetite to change. You're not alone but don't allow this to go on long term because your health will suffer.If you're losing weight and have no appetite, try to have something small, not long after waking up. This should help your appetite later on in the day. If it doesn't, go for more manageable meals and commit to getting through what you're eating. Exercise could help build your appetite so by all means do some sports, but not too much if you’re calorie intake is low. If you're eating too much, don't beat yourself up about it, it just leads to a circle of destruction. Look at what you're eating and see if there are healthier versions of that product or replace it with something else that you like and is better for you. Keep good food in the house. The harder it is to get to, the less likely you are to have it. Same as before exercise can also help with weight, physical and mental health.Sleep ChangesYou’ve barely slept, and it’s affecting your mood, energy, appetite etc. Exercise again can help, but make sure it's a while before bed and quite strenuous if you can. Try not to eat for the last few hours before bed, definitely nothing sugary or with too many carbohydrates. Try not to think you NEED to sleep, it will just anger you and turn the whole process into something you associate with negative connotations. Worrying does nothing.For at least an hour before bed, make sure your alarms are set and you've said your good-nights to people. Now PUT THAT PHONE AWAY! Turn the TV off. Maybe play a motivational podcast, audio book or some chilled music and make sure the bedroom is a nice temperature. White noise apps can be great.Anger Or IrritabilityIt can jeopardize a lot and you don't tend to always realise how you're acting or the damage is done. Most people will understand if you explain to them when you're calm and apologise. Once anger is there, it's usually too late and emotions can take over. Try and recognise when you're starting to feel flustered. If you feel it building, try to get out the situation, even temporarily or put something into place that you know calms you down. Whether it's breathing exercises, stress ball, an image in your head, you need to start counteracting it before it reaches terminal velocity. It will also dissipate quicker because you've caught it early. While it’s an issue, cut down caffeine and high levels of sugar as they can give you big highs and lows mentally and physically.Loss Of EnergyFor some people chucking on their favourite energetic song can help. Or motivational video. But exercise again can be your friend. Now, I get it "no energy and you're telling me to do exercise, get lost!” But if you force yourself to do 10/15 minutes it can make a major difference. I was in a bad place a few years ago and the gym was my absolute saviour then. Because you start hitting targets, you finally start to believe you can achieve more in other parts of your life too. Make sure you’re eating good food and enough, you're sleeping enough and if not then focus on this first.Self LoathingYou hate yourself! Everything you touch turns to dirt. Does it really though? You're just in a negative spiral and need to regain control. How? You need to feed your mind the positive thoughts. The moment you notice that you're thinking negatively about yourself, you need to replace it with something positive. Anything at all that makes you proud and confident. Write the positives down in advance to come back to when you need them. Next time one of the negative thoughts comes along, get the ammo out and shoot it down. YOU’RE the boss here! And....YOU’RE AWESOME!Reckless BehaviourYou’ve been feeding your subconscious for a long time with destructive and negative thoughts. Now, it’s manifesting itself like discussed earlier. The only way around this is to fight back, replace the thoughts and keep at it. Ask family and friends to help you notice this behaviour so you can work on it. Learn your triggers and when you feel it coming keep saying positive things to yourself, then they’ll plant in your mind. If you want them to stay there you have to keep at it.Submitted by: Richy

I have supported Jenny for approximately 2 years.Jenny initially went to the GP suffering from depression which she attributed to her caring role. The GP started her on some medication. Jenny went back to the GP as she found that the medication had not helped. She was then referred to a counsellor. Jenny’s counsellor asked if she had completed a carers’ assessment. Jenny stated that she hadn’t and to her knowledge had never been offered one. Jenny was referred for an assessment and subsequently referred to the Carers’ Support Service.In the past 2 years I have helped Jenny appeal against a decision that refused Martin an adaptation, as it was seen that it would not make him more independent. Jenny won the appeal and the adaptation that they have now she says has ‘changed their lives’. As a result of this she reports that she now feels more confident in dealing with professionals.Jenny has gone on to train in Mental Health First Aid. She reports that this has enabled her to feel more confident in how she handles things when Martin is unwell.Although Jenny’s caring role hasn’t changed she states that she feels that she is now able to cope better. She wishes that someone had informed her sooner that she could receive support for herself and is quite upset by this.Jenny is able to access the Carers’ Support Service as and when she needs to, so that when things are going well she is able to get on with life which she finds re-assuring.

Mohammed presented as extremely distressed and he was suffering from depression and severe anxiety. Mohammed had spent a number of years isolating himself from his community and at the point of his referral he was struggling to leave his house. At his first appointment Mohammed cried throughout his assessment and struggled to speak to his key worker. When Mohammed did communicate his speech was barely audible and he would not lift his head or make eye contact.Mohammed and his key worker began weekly appointments to build their relationship. Mohammed explained that he struggled to do everyday things like visit the shops or attend doctors’ appointments and he could not see a way out of how he was feeling. Mohammed frequently talked about wishing he was dead.Mohammed and his key worker put a plan together which identified what Mohammed’s goals were and how the Living Life Service would help him achieve these. Mohammed began to attend social sessions in the building, supported by his key worker initially, and then on his own. Gradually Mohammed felt able to respond to other people in a social setting and he began to look up from the floor when talking to other members of staff. By the end of October Mohammed felt comfortable enough to join a six week anxiety management group.Gradually, by achieving small goals set with his key worker on a weekly basis, like joining in a conversation in a social support session, practicing relaxation techniques at home and being supported to speak to his GP, Mohammed’s confidence has increased. The support from his key worker has reduced to an appointment every two to three weeks.Mohammed is now completing a WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) with support from Living Life, in a group setting in a community centre in the town. Mohammed travels to the group every week on his own and talks openly about his feelings and his hopes for the future.Mohammed and his key worker are now planning more for the future, Mohammed hopes to start attending the gym and he would like to be in a new relationship. Mohammed has stated that the support he has received from the Living Life Service has saved his life.

But this doesn't mean you won't have periods of good wellbeing.Here are some steps you can take to manage your mental wellbeing:Learn something new. Learning a new skill such as sport, art or cooking can help boost your confidence and give you a sense of achievement. It will give you a purpose and something you can look forward to. It doesn't have to be something big, it can be as little as trying a new recipe. Do something you enjoy. Whether it's taking a long walk, playing an instrument or going to the cinema, it's positive for your wellbeing to do something that makes you feel good. Get yourself into a routine and regularly do things for yourself to improve your mood and mental health. Try relaxation techniques. Doing something that you find relaxing, such as listening to music, colouring in or having a bath can help to reduce stress and improve your mental wellbeing. Below is a video from Mind with 8 ways to relax.5 ways to WellbeingThese 5 steps have been researched and developed by the New Economics Foundation. This claims that using these steps in day-to-day life can improve and maintain good mental health and wellbeing such as being active, taking notice of things and acts of kindness.Connect – Make sure you take time to connect and build on relationships with the people around you: your family, friends, colleagues and neighbours. Be active – This can be something little like going for a walk or play a game of football. Find an activity that you enjoy and make it a part of your life. Keep learning – developing a new skill can give you a sense of purpose and achievement as well as new confidence. Give to others – An act of kindness can go a long way, whether it's a smile, a thank you or a kind word. Larger acts, such as volunteering can improve your mental wellbeing and help you build new relationships. Take notice – be more aware of the present moment, including your thoughts and feelings, your body and the world around you. This is otherwise known as mindfulness. Find out more about all the steps on the Mind Website... Learn moreYou might like to downloadMindfulness and relaxation Mindfulness is a commonly used technique which can help people manage their mental health or simply gain more enjoyment from life.It involves making a special effort to give your full attention to what is happening in the present moment – to what's happening in your body, your mind or your surroundings.In mindfulness you work to become more aware of how you're thinking and feeling.How can mindfulness help?It can: increase your awareness of your thoughts and feelingsmanage unhelpful thoughtsdevelop more helpful responses to difficult feelings and situationshelp be kinder towards yourselfmake you feel calm and able to manage stress bettermanage some physical health problem, like chronic painYou can practice mindfulness by yourself as well as attending courses. Set aside some time. Mindfulness can be a part of daily life for some people, and we recommend short periods of mindful meditation in regular periods. You could even make time to do it day-to-day whenever you feel it works best.Build your practice. This is a brand new skill your learning so it will take time to develop. Most people find it hard to sit and meditate for long periods of time so at first, try a few minutes and gradually build up to more. As mindfulness involves paying more attention to what you do in your daily life, it can be a good idea to decide on one or two routine activities which you will try to do mindfully each day. This could mean focusing on:the taste, sight and temperature of drinking a cup of tea or coffeethe sounds and smells of having a showerthe taste and sensations of brushing your teeththe sound of the kettle boilingthe sensations of your body as you sit in a chairthe feel of your feet and body moving as you walkThe key steps to remember when you do a form of mindfulness is to:Pay attention – Make extra effort and attention to your senses such as how something feels and how something smells and what that does to you.Notice – When your mind begins to wander, notice where your thoughts have drifted to and why. Aware and accept – Think of the emotions you are feeling or the sensations in your body. Try to observe these changes and accept.Be kind to yourself – Remember that mindfulness is difficult to do when your mind will always wander. Try to just gently let your mind back into focus. You might like to downloadOur Wellbeing coursesTo promote self help and self care, we also offer a range of short courses at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.

Self-Care for Mental Illness
Mental illness is really bloody hard. Unless you’ve been through it, you won’t really have any understanding as to what it’s like. Heck, even when suffering, you have no idea what another person is going through. All you can really do is empathise. But, I’ll try and do a different post on how to help someone with mental… Continue readingMental illness is really bloody hard. Unless you’ve been through it, you won’t really have any understanding as to what it’s like. Heck, even when suffering, you have no idea what another person is going through. All you can really do is empathise. But, I’ll try and do a different post on how to help someone with mental illnesses in the future. For now, I’ll stick to self-care. Obviously, this won’t work for everyone, but in the past eight years, you could say I’ve tried a lot of different things, read a lot of different books and websites, talked to lots of different people and these are what work for me.1. RestRest is the greatest tool for any type of illness. If you have a common cold, the first thing you’re told is to get as much rest as possible to allow your body to repair itself, that’s what it’s there for. Why should the brain not get the same attention? I recently read a book called ‘Depressive Illness‘ by Dr. Tim Cantopher who recommends rest very strongly, and I wholeheartedly agree.No one quite knows exactly how the brain works yet, which is why there are so many different treatments for the vast array of mental illnesses, but recuperating in a safe place can’t be the worst thing to do at all. Making sure that I’m safe and well, however long that takes, is the easiest and safest option I have. In basic terms, sleep is a bloody life-saver and will help you so much.2. Binging NetflixI’m renowned for watching TV series in a matter of days, often repeatedly. It may seem to an outsider that this is because I bloody love Orange is the New Black (for the record – I do). That’s not the main reason though. It blocks out all the bad stuff that tries to control my life. It helps me to try and focus – albeit not very well, hence the rewatching – on something other than what my brain is telling me, all the insecurities and anxieties and thoughts that may try and enter. I’ll admit, it doesn’t always work at blocking things out, but it serves it’s purpose most of the time. If finding out what happens to Walt White in Season 5 of Breaking Bad blocks out the darkness, even just for 47 minutes, I’m 100% down with that.3. ReadingSimilar to the last point, reading blocks everything out. I’ve always been one of those readers who gets lost in a book and has to finish it the same day (probably why I’ve read more this year than any other year since I was about 10). It’s a method of escapism from your own mind. I literally can’t think of anything else but the book I’m reading and that is excellent, I honestly couldn’t wish for anymore – except obviously when the book finishes and I get that empty void (until the next one). If you want to see what I’m reading at the moment, you can add me on Goodreads. Basically, reading shuts out EVERYTHING and doesn’t allow for anything else – which is great if that’s what you’re aiming for.4. MusicNow, this is a tricky one. I have a lot of songs that really trigger me, and I’ve learnt that it’s fine to listen them to get out all those emotions that I need to get out at the time. But not all the time. Music can be really helpful though, and I’m trying to focus on the good songs that pull you out of that awful place. Arctic Monkeys (fave band ever!) always seem to get me into a great mood however I’m feeling, they’ve saved my life countless times. *Also recommend 60s Soul for pulling you out of any dark place and feeling like you’re on top of the world.* It doesn’t matter what time of day, where I am, who I’m with – all you need to do is pop in your earphones and everything can change. I guess that’s the whole point of music, to make you feel something, whether it be sadness, happiness or pumped for life.5. ProjectsI don’t care what your project is. When I came out of hospital, I started the #100DaysOfMakeup on Instagram because it meant that for 100 days, I had to do something every single day. It wasn’t to showcase my makeup abilities or anything like that, it was a reason to stay alive. I set myself a challenge and had to accomplish it, because I’m just that stubborn. My new project is going to be painting my bedroom. Your project could be anything, from collecting all the Pokémon on Pokémon Go (gotta catch ’em all and all that) to making sure you brush your teeth twice a day for the next 10 days, it can be literally anything. It gives you a reason to be here, it gives you a reason to persevere against those bad thoughts. Whatever you want to do, go for it, there’s no reason not to and you CAN do it.6. A BathThis is probably the heading that sounds the most boring, I agree. Though, when you’re at your worst, bathing doesn’t seem like the most essential thing. Do it. Have a bath, throw in that Lush bath bomb you were saving for a special occasion, borrow your mother’s bath salts if you have to. You deserve it, your body that’s keeping you going – despite your brain’s attempts to salvage it – deserves it. Whilst soaking your body, you’ll find it does wonders to your mind as a pleasant side-effect.7. AvoidanceAvoidance isn’t the best tactic in the world, and shouldn’t be the one you turn to for the long term. But it helps me. Avoiding things, places, people, anything that I know will trigger me and keep me safe is one of the most important pieces of self-care I’ve learnt. Would I (my friends, my family, anyone) prefer to be in somewhere they find comfort or somewhere where they know they could relapse/breakdown/not be very comfortable at all? Obviously the former – if you chose the latter, you’re a little daredevil and I very strongly admire you. Taking care of yourself, first and foremost, is the most important thing, because when you get down to it, if you’re not there then there really isn’t any point. Saying this, I regularly push myself out of my comfort zone – even if it’s just to go into town alone and reward myself with a Starbucks sugar-free vanilla soya latte. But, if you know it will cause you harm, just don’t do it. If you need to avoid it because it will make you worse, then avoid it, no point in harming your own recovery.8. Support NetworkFor a long time, I didn’t feel like I had any support network at all. I’d barricaded myself in my safe place, my room, for so long that I felt like I’d lost everything, everyone. Slowly, I’m trying to reconnect with the people I’d shut out for so long and that’s making me feel a lot better. You’ll realise that people want to help and care for you. I know that blackness in your mind says that you’re not worth it but if you try, people will understand (except from those who are so ignorant – but you don’t need those in your life anyway). Even if you feel there is no one you can speak to, or that you don’t want anyone to know what you’re feeling, you can email me at megrrees@gmail.com or tweet me, no judgement and I’ll try and reply as soon as possible. People do care for you and want to support you as much as possible.Submitted by: Megan

Self-help from a person whose experienced it for years
Depression and anxiety can be one horrible thing to go through. Questioning yourself, putting yourself down, self-sabotaging. You want to help yourself, but the other half of you doesn't and will fight you if you try. Because I've been through it all a lot over the years, I understand it can be a constant battle but have… Continue readingDepression and anxiety can be one horrible thing to go through. Questioning yourself, putting yourself down, self-sabotaging. You want to help yourself, but the other half of you doesn't and will fight you if you try. Because I've been through it all a lot over the years, I understand it can be a constant battle but have picked up techniques to help.Feelings Of Helplessness/HopelessnessYou feel absolutely useless, worse than anybody else. Nobody could possibly mess up as much as you, right? WRONG. There are many people, just like you struggling through their own problems. Don’t measure yourself against others. Some people are good at putting on an air of success, happiness and confidence, it doesn't mean they are. Most show the world what they want them to see. You're awesome! And you need to tell yourself that a hell of a lot more.You have 2 sides of your mind. You’re conscious and you’re subconscious. The conscious is the voice in your head telling yourself that you're useless, it feeds your subconscious with whatever you allow it to. The subconscious can be more powerful. Your subconscious is where your actions tend to manifest themselves. So the best way of fighting this is to remember the "voice in your head". We all talk to ourselves whether we realise it or not. Keep telling yourself you're useless, and your subconscious will believe it and manifest it in your life. But if you become more aware of these "voices" or thoughts then you're already on the way to helping yourself. Every time any negativity pops up, you need to pounce on that bad lad before your subconscious gets to it. Tell yourself “NO!” and Combat it with some pre-planned positive thoughts.If you don't believe it, don’t worry, originally it’s about thinking it anyway. Say it out loud. Write it down. Look at it and think it CONSTANTLY.Loss of Interest In Daily ActivitiesYou wake up in the morning and just can’t be bothered to interact or do anything. But we both know it’s not good for you. And you aren’t going to let it beat you.If you went to climb a mountain, you’re aware you're not superman and can't just jump to the top. Don't expect too much from yourself from day one. A doctor once told my dad when he was suffering with depression, "even if you just clean a cup that day, do it, do it well and be happy you've done it". So even if you just get up and do something small, if it’s more than you would have done, its progress. Set your own "tiny targets" to begin with, and each thing you achieve, be proud, its progress! Well done you! I hope you've got long arms because you need to pat yourself on the back. YOU'RE AWESOME! Eventually your subconscious believes whatever you tell it, the same way liars can convince themselves that they're telling the truth, only you will be!Appetite And Weight ChangesOne that I personally am struggling with the most at the moment. No appetite most of the time, so don't eat as much as I should. For some it will be the opposite. It is very common when you're low for your appetite to change. You're not alone but don't allow this to go on long term because your health will suffer.If you're losing weight and have no appetite, try to have something small, not long after waking up. This should help your appetite later on in the day. If it doesn't, go for more manageable meals and commit to getting through what you're eating. Exercise could help build your appetite so by all means do some sports, but not too much if you’re calorie intake is low. If you're eating too much, don't beat yourself up about it, it just leads to a circle of destruction. Look at what you're eating and see if there are healthier versions of that product or replace it with something else that you like and is better for you. Keep good food in the house. The harder it is to get to, the less likely you are to have it. Same as before exercise can also help with weight, physical and mental health.Sleep ChangesYou’ve barely slept, and it’s affecting your mood, energy, appetite etc. Exercise again can help, but make sure it's a while before bed and quite strenuous if you can. Try not to eat for the last few hours before bed, definitely nothing sugary or with too many carbohydrates. Try not to think you NEED to sleep, it will just anger you and turn the whole process into something you associate with negative connotations. Worrying does nothing.For at least an hour before bed, make sure your alarms are set and you've said your good-nights to people. Now PUT THAT PHONE AWAY! Turn the TV off. Maybe play a motivational podcast, audio book or some chilled music and make sure the bedroom is a nice temperature. White noise apps can be great.Anger Or IrritabilityIt can jeopardize a lot and you don't tend to always realise how you're acting or the damage is done. Most people will understand if you explain to them when you're calm and apologise. Once anger is there, it's usually too late and emotions can take over. Try and recognise when you're starting to feel flustered. If you feel it building, try to get out the situation, even temporarily or put something into place that you know calms you down. Whether it's breathing exercises, stress ball, an image in your head, you need to start counteracting it before it reaches terminal velocity. It will also dissipate quicker because you've caught it early. While it’s an issue, cut down caffeine and high levels of sugar as they can give you big highs and lows mentally and physically.Loss Of EnergyFor some people chucking on their favourite energetic song can help. Or motivational video. But exercise again can be your friend. Now, I get it "no energy and you're telling me to do exercise, get lost!” But if you force yourself to do 10/15 minutes it can make a major difference. I was in a bad place a few years ago and the gym was my absolute saviour then. Because you start hitting targets, you finally start to believe you can achieve more in other parts of your life too. Make sure you’re eating good food and enough, you're sleeping enough and if not then focus on this first.Self LoathingYou hate yourself! Everything you touch turns to dirt. Does it really though? You're just in a negative spiral and need to regain control. How? You need to feed your mind the positive thoughts. The moment you notice that you're thinking negatively about yourself, you need to replace it with something positive. Anything at all that makes you proud and confident. Write the positives down in advance to come back to when you need them. Next time one of the negative thoughts comes along, get the ammo out and shoot it down. YOU’RE the boss here! And....YOU’RE AWESOME!Reckless BehaviourYou’ve been feeding your subconscious for a long time with destructive and negative thoughts. Now, it’s manifesting itself like discussed earlier. The only way around this is to fight back, replace the thoughts and keep at it. Ask family and friends to help you notice this behaviour so you can work on it. Learn your triggers and when you feel it coming keep saying positive things to yourself, then they’ll plant in your mind. If you want them to stay there you have to keep at it.Submitted by: Richy

Exciting Anti Stigma Project



We are appealing for volunteers who have direct personal experience of mental distress either as a user of services, through personal self-management or as a carer to take part in our exciting anti stigma project.
People with mental health problems can experience prejudice and discrimination, many state that the stigma of mental ill health is more disabling than the illness itself. Therefore we want to work with you to challenge attitudes towards mental health discrimination and assist in achieving a recognisable shift in local public attitudes.
You don’t need to have experience of working on a project only an interest to take part and work with other liked minded people to help develop a range of activities that will help break down barriers in relation to mental health. We want to encourage people to talk openly about the subject and you will be part of this change. You will be a valued member of the steering group, helping to develop and design the programme to be delivered in locations across Middlesbrough. Your involvement can be as large or as small as you wish.
Activities include filming, local radio and assisting Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind with local campaigning such as World Mental Health Day.

Peer Support Mentor




 Closing date for applications:  17 August 2017 12:00am 

A Peer Support Facilitator is vital to the growth and sustainability of support groups in the community. The local Teesside-By-Side network, consists of 20 groups that operate independently in the community, to provide non-clinical support to locals through the sharing of mutual experiences and interests.
The groups vary in what they focus on; some are activity based such as walking, running and art, others focus on sharing experiences in relation to mental health or physical conditions.
As a facilitator, you will attend a range of support groups in the community, to:

Support new group leads to set up their group
Facilitate groups when a lead is unavailable
Provide ongoing assistance through occasional drop in sessions

As a facilitator, you will ensure the groups run smoothly, that rules and guidelines are implemented and followed as set out by each group and ensure participants feel safe in the meetings.

Why I decided to volunteer
For those of you who may not be aware, June 1st-7th is National Volunteers' Week in the UK.

This is an event set up specifically with the aim of celebrating the achievements of those who volunteer, raising the profiles of the organisations who need volunteers, and encouraging those who have never volunteered before to give it a try. Volunteering is something I had always wanted to do, but with school, college, and then university taking up so much time- not to mention my anxiety disorder making new experiences incredibly frightening for me- I always avoided the chance to get involved. However, after finishing my Master's degree I found I had a lot of free time. After admitting that my anxiety made it difficult for me to try new things, Mind was suggested. Being somebody who suffers from mental illness, I'd obviously heard of it, and I knew of its reputation as a great place for support. So, I bit the bullet, researched opportunities, and soon enquired about joining their anti-stigma group. As the title suggests, this is a group with my local Mind branch that meets regularly to discuss and implement ways of reducing the stigma around mental health. This includes encouraging more people to open up, reaching out to employers, and getting involved with local and nationwide events relating to mental illness. I was terrified before attending my first meeting. Would I have to speak? What if I embarrassed myself by saying something stupid? How would I manage in a room full of people I'd never met before? Thankfully there was nothing to worry about. Not only was everybody welcoming, but there was no pressure to talk if you were too nervous to do so. It was a great experience, and one of the few things I do that I actually look forward to, instead of dread for days beforehand.So, now I'm a volunteer, here is why I love volunteering, and some tips so you can get involved too!1.	Look into organisations that relate to things you care about. Obviously every charity works towards a worthwhile cause, but I find that I'm much more invested when what I'm working on relates to my own experiences. This means I can generate ideas based on things I've actually gone through myself, and I can connect with the other volunteers much easier because we all understand what it's like to suffer from mental illness. I've already met some great people, all inspiring in their own ways, who suffer from similar things, and so are easier to talk to about certain topics.2.	Volunteering is a great way to build up your own confidence and self-esteem. There are so many chances to get involved, and you can do as much or as little as you want. When I first got involved I promised myself that I would force myself out of my comfort zone, and say yes to things I would normally shy away from. Just a couple of weeks ago I sat with the group while being filmed by Tyne Tees News, and a few days ago I sat (on my own!) in front of a camera and talked about why I enjoy volunteering so much.3.	Opportunities like those in the above point are great to put on your CV and applications! It shows that you care about causes and issues, and that you can get involved with things of your own volition, and not just because of the paycheck at the end of the month. It can boost your career, and give you some fantastic skills depending on the opportunities available. There are often chances to gain extra qualifications and certifications, which can also enhance your CV and really make you stand out from the crowd. 4.	You meet fantastic people. If you volunteer for something that relates to your own experience, you'll soon have validation of your feelings, because you'll be surrounded by those who have gone through the same thing. 5.	There is no pressure. Obviously it's wonderful if you can be available for everything, but this isn't always possible. There is complete understanding that sometimes things come up, and that's okay! 6.	You can make a difference. Stigma is still a really significant issue in the conversations around mental health, and to know that we're helping to break down those walls, and correct any misconceptions that people have about speaking out, is a fantastic feeling. No matter which charity or organisation you choose, you will always be making a difference to somebody!So if you have some spare time now that summer is finally getting underway, take some time to research the groups and organisations in your local area. They're always looking for more volunteers, and you'll have a fantastic time while gaining invaluable experience. Give it a try!Submitted by: Iona

Volunteering has helped me massively
I naturally see the potential in others and hope to instil confidence and self belief in them so that they can achieve too. Becoming a volunteer has shown that people have trust, faith and belief in me and this has made a massive difference to me, a huge difference, an incredible boost.Submitted by: Steven

Volunteer and help others
You can help yourself through depression and anxiety by helping other people and volunteering yourself. I've really found that the 'helpers high' I get makes me feel so much better about myself.

Why Mental Health Awareness Week is so important this year

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



This week, from the 16th to the 22nd, is Mental Health Awareness Week and the theme for 2016 is relationships.
According to the Mental Health Foundation, good relationships help us live longer and happier lives with fewer physical and mental health problems.

The foundation believes that we urgently need a much greater focus on the quality of our relationships and to understand how fundamental they are to our health and wellbeing. They are urging everyone to go the extra mile in prioritising their relationships and to make a relationship resolution – that is, to assess how much time we actively commit to building and maintaining good relationships, and to ask whether we can invest more in being present with and listening to friends, family and colleagues.
The focus on relationships for 2016 stems from a survey of 2,000 adults in the UK which revealed that 46 per cent admitted they regret not investing more time in their relationships – a figure which hits 50 per cent among men. And despite the fact that most people claim to value their social lives above their physical health, only 11 per cent of people surveyed made it the focus of their New Year’s resolutions.
The foundation is asking people to get involved this year in a number of different ways. These include:

Hosting an event – you can help start conversations around mental health by holding an event. Ideas include a wellbeing walk, a sports tournament, pub quiz and a cake sale. You can even add your event to the Mental Health Foundation’s activity map, where you can see what other people are planning during the week.


Spreading the word – these days social media makes it easier than ever to get involved and spread the word, and you can do so via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by using the hashtag #MHAW16


Share your story – the Mental Health Foundation is asking people to share their stories about how relationships have been a source of strength. If you would like to do this, they ask for 400 words to be sent to stories@mentalhealth.org.uk

School P.E. nightmares mean women shun exercise – putting them at risk of poor physical and mental health

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Women with mental health problems are not exercising because of bad experiences with P.E. at school – putting them at greater risk of poor physical, and mental, Mind has warned. More than half of women (57%) do not participate in sport because they were not good at PE at school while nearly half (43%) feel it is too competitive.
In response, National Mind has today launched a new motivational website to help women with mental health problems choose a sport which is suitable for them, enabling them to take the first step and get active to improve their physical and mental wellbeing.
Women with mental health problems are more likely to have physical health problems such as diabetes and heart disease so being active can be really important for looking after their physical health. Mind’s new website is part of the charity’s physical activity project, Get Set to Go, supported by Sport England and the National Lottery.
Mind’s new website asks people to select reasons stopping them from exercising, and provides practical tips and real life stories to inspire people take the first step, and reap the benefits of an active lifestyle.
We know that having a mental health problem can make getting active more difficult. The thought of joining a running group when you have bipolar disorder, depression or OCD can stop you in your tracks – but a mental health problem doesn’t have to prevent anybody from getting active.
Through Get Set to Go, Mind aims to support 75,000 people with mental health problems to improve their lives through physical activity. The programme supports people with mental health problems become more active through eight sports projects across England. Those taking part receive one-to-one support from others with shared experiences, who understand the additional challenges a mental health problem presents to those who want to get active.
Want to find out more about our Get Set To Go projects?Contact Andy Birks - andrew.birks@middlesbroughandstocktonmind.org.uk

We’re Proud to Support Carers Week

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



This week, from the 6th to the 12nd, is Carers Week – an annual awareness campaign to celebrate and recognise the vital contribution made by the UK’s 6.5 million carers.The campaign is brought to life by thousands of individuals and organisations who come together to organise activities and events throughout the UK, drawing attention to just how important caring is.This year, the focus is on ‘Building Carer Friendly Communities’. Communities which support carers to look after their loved ones well, while recognising that they are individuals with needs of their own.Here at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, we are here for you and your family if you care for someone who has a mental health difficulty. We understand that caring for someone with a mental health difficulty can bring unique challenges, and we can support you in many different ways to face these challenges.
The carers support service can offer:

One-to-one emotional support
Person centred carers support plans
Advocacy
Information and Advice
Support Groups
Wellbeing workshops
Signposting to other organisations

We can work with you if:

You are aged 18 or over
You or the person you care for lives in Middlesbrough
You are a relative, partner or friend of an adult with mental health difficulties
The person you are supporting does not need to be accessing mental health services

We are happy to meet you where you are comfortable, such as in your own home, local community centre or café, or you can come to our building on Lothian Road. You can refer yourself to the service by giving us a ring on 01642 257020, completing an enquiry form on this website or sending us an email at carers@middlesbroughandstocktonmind.org.uk The service is usually available Monday-Thursday 9am-5pm and Friday 9am-4pm. If you need an appointment outside these times, we will always try to arrange this.

Fraser's Story...

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Whilst being involved in one of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind’s groups, Fraser and another member discussed how they would like to set up a peer support group for those that had experiences of anxiety and depression, as there were no groups of this type in the Middlesbrough area at that time. They spoke to a member of staff at Mind, completed the peer support training and started looking for venues.
Fraser shares: “I was a bit apprehensive at first as we were starting something new and I was concerned about what levels of anxiety and depression people may have, however myself and co-peer supporter have different skills and strengths which worked well, we were able to support and encourage the group to support each other. We started with 3 – 4 people attending the weekly sessions, these members still come to the group now. We have grown over the year and have on average between 6-8 people attending each week, with additional people coming along to the group when they feel they need support. Being a peer supporter has helped my own recovery, the personal benefits in supporting each other and seeing people progress in their own lives is really rewarding”.
Fraser also co-facilitates courses within Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind’s Connect Recovery College. The co-facilitator’s role is highly valued and an important aspect of the delivery, having combined the content with lived experience can support and encourage those on the course.
Fraser explains: “Whilst co-facilitating courses, my confidence has grown from supporting within the group to delivering sessions with the tutor. As a co-facilitator I am part of the quality assurance panel, so I also have involvement in the design and reviewing of courses, we ensure the best value for those accessing them.”
Fraser feels being a peer supporter and a peer support co-facilitator is valuable to his recovery. Week to week he looks forward to giving back and sharing his experiences and encouragement to positively support others. Fantastic examples of peer support locally!

MOM’s (Mind Over Matter) Peer Support group experiences

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



After completing an informational course 4 years ago, with others who are affected by bipolar, Ivor and another member wanted to continue meeting with the group as they found sharing their experiences had helped them. They decided to set up a peer support group for continued support. When the sessions started, the numbers attending were not consistent week to week, sometimes members were not well enough to attend regularly, so they decided to open the group to those experiencing any type of mental health difficulty or illness. After a period of time, venue costs started to have an impact on whether the group could still run, the group was close to ending. On recognition of the value the group had on its members, Ivor looked for a different venue to continue weekly sessions. A local library in Middlesbrough were happy to provide some space, meaning the support for each other could be continued.
Speaking to members of the group, one shared: “I have been coming to the group for 4 years. We come together and discuss how we feel and ways to cope. It helps me to be with others who have similar experiences to myself, they understand me, as it’s hard to explain how I feel to people who haven’t experienced mental health difficulties or illness themselves. If I am feeling anxious, I know I can get support from the group. I look forward to Tuesdays and attending the group. It also reassures my husband when he is at work that I am being supported, he knows I’m ok”.
Another member shared: “Having bipolar, I find that when I am unwell I can start to become isolated, coming to the group helps to keep me well. At the group we voice our thoughts, talk about how we can prevent episodes, how we feel when we are not well, any worries, and we also share ideas, strategies, advice and learn from each other. On my own I didn’t know where to turn to, but the group helps me to think about and try different strategies to keep well. I know at the group I am understood. Bipolar can affect me where I can become isolated and lonely, but the group gives me purpose to go out and be away from the house, to a place where I can share how I feel, with people who understand, no judgements made. Coming to this group is valuable to my recovery”.
A member who had recently moved to the area explained, “Being new to the area, a carer for my wife and having depression and anxiety, I wanted to meet with others who I felt comfortable with. After 2 weeks of attending this group I’m feeling the benefits of meeting new people and sharing experiences. Confidentiality within the group has helped me be more open, and in this short time I already feel part of the group”.
The group meets at Hemlington library, Middlesbrough 1.30 – 3pm every Tuesday

Swift-tees: A community support group

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Swift-tees is a community support group, where walking, jogging and running is practiced as a way to improve both mental and physical health as well as overall well being. At each session the route ends back at the community centre, where the group stay for a brew, cake and chat. This part of the session plays a key role in an individual’s progress, supporting new friendships, increasing motivation, participation and involvement, and improving general mental health and over all well being.
Rosannes Story…..
Rosanne’s story begins when she started taking her daughter to the weekly park run. Rosanne, in her seventh year of taking medication for depression, encouraged her daughter’s involvement in the activity. She would not have been disheartened, however, if her daughter’s involvement was a passing phase as she could think of other things to do on a Saturday morning. As she took her daughter each week she was encouraged to join in, which she did. Within 3 months, Rosanne could feel the benefits and found her-self looking forward to the weekly sessions. Such was her motivation and enthusiasm, that by the 3rd month, family and friends were noticing her weight loss and by the 5th month, her hard work and effort saw her achieve ‘Park runner of the month’. After a year of running, Rosanne felt ready to reduce her medication. After discussion with her GP, her medication was reduced over a period of time, and eventually, again after discussion with her GP, she was able to stop taking the medication. The more Rosanne ran, the faster she was becoming and the better she felt, feeling an improvement in both mental and physical health. Over a 4 year period since then, Rosanne has gone from a dress size 20 to a size 10.
In her first year of running, after completing an amazing personal best time at the park run, Rosanne wanted to encourage and support those who ran at the back, or maybe struggling like she once had. When the summer came to an end and the park closed on an evening, a small group wanted to carry on running….. and so Swift-tees was formed, a community support group to help people improve all aspects of their health and overall well-being. Now in its 4th year of running , Swift-tees continues to support people and have a positive impact within the community.
Lucy’s story…
Lucy joined Swift- tees 12 months ago. Married with 4 children, she had some reluctance and hesitation in joining the group to begin with. At this time Lucy was feeling lonely, becoming more isolated and depressed following the death of her beloved mother. Juggling with the daily routine and being a full time mum, the family came first and Lucy spent very little time on herself or doing activities she enjoyed, the more isolated she became, the more lonely and depressed she became, which then became a vicious circle.
Lucy would take her sons to the weekly park run, whilst waiting for the boys to complete their morning activity she would take the dogs for a walk around the park. Her awareness and then involvement with Swift-tees first started with a smile and a hello from those who were doing the park run, which then developed into brief conversations and encouragement to join the Swift-tees group. Hearing of people’s own personal stories for being involved in the group and their progress in both physical and mental health, Lucy felt inspired to join the group, even though she had her own anxieties which were based on her perceptions around her appearance, weight and physical ability.
The day Lucy started the Swift-tees group, she was filled with nerves and anxiety. When she arrived she was given a warm welcome and reassurance that she would be supported. A group member, Julie, accompanied her as they jogged to one lamppost and walked to the next, continuing to repeat the pattern. On completion they congregated with the rest of the group in the community centre where they had a cup of coffee/ tea and a chat. This was to become an important part of the weekly sessions. Starting to connect with people and getting support from others, Lucy had found something she enjoyed being part of, she was making new friends and feeling supported, which helped reduce feelings of isolation, loneliness, and depression.
Swift-tees is now a big part of Lucy’s life, having a positive impact on her mental health and family life, with her husband and 4 children regularly attending the group sessions. Her own efforts and commitment has seen her develop from being anxious and self conscious with little belief in herself and abilities, to her being an active member of the group, meeting with group members outside sessions to run; volunteering within the group; and improving her physical health, losing 25lbs in weight over the year.
Lucy has progressed and achieved so much since starting the group, she came 2nd in the Swift-tees ladies league, she has completed the Hardmoors trail run –a race for people to practice running and descending/ascending on trails in the dark, challenging but fun! and her plans for this year are to complete 4 half marathons, including the Great North Run.
A year ago Lucy never thought that her life could have improved in this way. She once thought that she could not do what others could. With the support, encouragement and friendship of a fantastic group of peers, her life has changed so much for the better. Lucy shared: “ I once thought and told myself I can’t ,…however, through support and encouragement from the Swift-tees group, I now know that I can….!!!”

Leonie’s Story…

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Due to personal experiences of anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, Leonie found a way to feel more focussed and relaxed through mindfulness art and poetry. Leonie had tried group therapy, but found at that time it wasn’t really for her, although she did find some comfort and support from being around other people who had similar experiences. She started reading and researching mindfulness, and began practicing some mindful activities. She then combined what she had learned with her love of art and love of words, this then became a big part in her recovery.
After 18 months of feeling comfortable and being able to manage her mental health, Leonie wanted to help others who had similar experiences of mental health difficulties. She contacted Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind after seeing the peer support training on the website. She completed the training and attended the first Side by Side Hub Networking Event, where she linked with others and gained more support through advice and encouragement. She was now raring to set up her new group. Leonie planned out the practicalities of starting the group whilst attending the training, and also had some advice sessions around promoting the group, with Naomi from the Side by Side Peer Support programme. Leonie’s passion, motivation and enthusiasm then saw her getting the final things in place and in no time The MAP Project (Mindfulness Art and Poetry) peer support group was ready to begin.
Leonie shares: “I'm hoping people will benefit from the group through a chance to connect with others who have similar experiences and understanding, whilst engaging in creative mindful activities. It's my wish that everyone who attends feels heard, comfortable and supported”.
We look forward to hearing about ‘The MAP Project’ peer support group and how it develops over the next few months
The group starts Tuesday 26th January 2016, 12.30pm -2.30pm and runs weekly, at St John the Baptist Church, 159 Durham Road, Stockton TS19 0DZ 
For Further information please email Leonie at map.projectz@yahoo.com

Steph's Story: Raindrops to Rainbows: A peer support group for those with pre/postnatal depression

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Having experienced postnatal depression after having her second child, Steph felt that she had little support or people to turn to who had an understanding of what she was going through. At the time she struggled but managed to deal with these experiences through researching postnatal depression and practicing strategies for self- management. In the years after, Stephanie felt passionate about providing support for others that she could not find herself when needed. She wanted to share her experiences in a positive way and created Raindrops to Rainbows, a peer support group for mums experiencing pre/postnatal depression, where those with lived experience of pre/postnatal depression can come together, share experiences, advice, support each other and receive information on relevant local services.
Steph explains “Initially, I did wonder whether I could handle the responsibility of setting up the first group, however, because I knew that there was a need for it, I jumped in feet first. A centre in Billingham gave me the opportunity to hold weekly peer support groups at their venue and that’s where the first group began. It was difficult at first to engage mums due to the stigma and misconception of what would happen if they told people about their postnatal depression, however, on our board of directors we have a social worker as well as an antenatal teacher, they support with advice and guidance around misconceptions.
You can see the difference that coming to the groups has on the mums, being able to open up and share experiences with others who have the same or similar experiences is a relief and support for many who would otherwise become isolated. Just recently one of the mums commented how the group has really helped as it gets her out of the house and meeting other mums instead of sitting at home. She said it was good to be around people that understand you, and although it’s hard some days to motivate herself to get to the group, she always felt better after attending.
Since starting up the first group in Billingham 18 months ago, we have set up weekly groups in Jarrow and Newton Aycliffe and more recently working with Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind’s Side by Side Peer Support programme, we have also linked with BigLife Families in Stockton, to set up a new weekly peer support group in central Stockton. Raised awareness of pre/postnatal depression in the areas where the groups run is apparent. Community support from Stockton has been particularly great in raising awareness and raising funds, with events held and further events planned at the Music Lounge in Stockton. Community support helps to keep the groups running and allows us to expand and provide support in more areas. Anyone who is or thinks they are experiencing pre/postnatal depression please come along to one of the groups."
Local Groups:
Billingham Group: Tuesday’s 1-2 pm at the New Life Family Centre, Low Grange Avenue, Billingham, Stockton on Tees (Weekly Group)
Stockton Group: Starts Monday 1st February 1-2pm at The Star Children’s Centre, Bath Lane, Stockton (Weekly Group)
For further information please contact Steph on info@raindropstorainbows.co.uk

Keep Warm - to prevent all kinds of health conditions and illnesses.Eat Well - to maintain energy levels and strengthFlu Jab - a free of charge vaccination encouraged in young children and older peopleKeep informed about common viruses in order to get a head-start on preventing their symptoms.

Christmas can be a difficult time for everyone

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Even if you start early in the year, the decorating, gift buying and cooking causes a lot of worry as we strive to provide the perfect Christmas for our family and friends, and forget about ourselves.
We can work ourselves silly in order to avoid anyones disappointment on the big day.
If you suffer from a mental health issue these problems can be heightened and reach a dangerous level. The stresses of Christmas can become totally overwhelming and cause a lot of worries for yourself and your loved ones.
But its very important not to ruin the holiday for yourself; make space for a little ‘me time’ and don’t be afraid to say no. If tempers flare and worries get the better of you, remember, its only one day of the year - just enjoy what you can and let the pressures go.
Don’t let your mental illness spoil your Christmas, speak to us and we can help.
Mind's Light Up Christmas Appeal is here to support those suffering from depression this Christmas, read more here and find out how your donation can make a difference.

How many spoons have you used today?

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



The Spoon Theory is a really useful way to conserve and plan your energy throughout the day.
Most people start the day without having to think too much about what they need to do, whereas people with a health condition have to plan ahead. A healthy person has a good supply of energy to use throughout the day, where as a person with a health condition has significantly less, i.e. 12 spoons. The spoons represent the energy needed to complete each task. Each spoon represents a task such as taking a shower, making a cup of tea, preparing a meal, reading a book, housework or taking a walk.
Having only 12 spoons in a day means you have to think carefully about how you use and conserve your energy, this can be tricky to master at first, however with practice you can learn how to use the spoon theory to make your day less physically and emotionally demanding meaning you don’t burn out as often and feel able to cope better in all aspects of your life.
The spoon Theory was devised by Christine Miserandino. Christine has Lupus, an autoimmune condition which causes chronic pain from swelling in the joints and also causes severe fatigue.
If you are living with a Long Term Condition and would like support on how to manage your condition and improve your wellbeing and quality of life please contact the Mind Reablement Service for more information on: (01642) 257020

Help others Get Set to Go

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


Can you spare some time to help people increase their physical activity levels?
We’re always looking for volunteers who understand how sport and physical activity improves our mental and physical health. You’ll be able to use your own experiences to support people with mental health problems so they can also enjoy the benefits of being active.
You’ll need to be able to establish good relationships with people from different backgrounds and have experience of a mental health problem – either personally or from a close friend or relative.
We’ll support and train you as one of our volunteer Peer Navigators, which could be the first step of a new career in sport mentoring or peer support.
Find out more about our Get Set to Go project here

A Royal Visit for WMHD

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



The Duke and Duchess or Cambridge are due to visit a Mind event held at Harrow College this Saturday to raise awareness of mental healh and young people for World Mental Health Day.
Mental Health Day takes place yearly in order to raise awareness to the increasing number of people in the UK suffering from mental heath problems, and to help illuminate the stigma surrounding the issue.
One in four adults will suffer from a mental health problem in any given year. This is an alarmingly high statistic and yet, there is still a taboo surrounding comfortable discussion of our mental health struggles.Just like a physical illness, mental illness needs to be treated safely and with dignity but unfortunately only a quarter of sufferers seek help, leaving the majority of people going it alone with their mental health problems.
A key way of battling this stigma is by providing people with more information regarding mental illness from an early age and attempting to prevent the stigma from developing and therefore suppling help for those suffering before their problems grow.
This October people across the UK can help raise awareness by filling social media with facts and figures surrounding mental health, success stories and places to get help. Everything that can help people with knowing help is available to never be ashamed of coming forward with a mental health issue.

Mind says ‘It’s OK to cry'

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


Too many people are putting on a brave face when anxious, as Mind says 'It's OK to cry!'
Research from Mind has found that four in five 18 to 34 year olds put on a brave face when they are anxious, according to the mental health charity Mind. Despite this one in five admitted to crying in the past week because of anxiety. Anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems and Mind says crying is actually both a common and useful response to dealing with it. The charity is today launching a free guide to help people better understand how to cope with stress and anxiety.
The Mind poll¹ also revealed that a quarter of 18 to 34 year olds feel that showing their emotions is a sign of weakness. This attitude towards emotion and anxiety stands in stark contrast with older adults, with only one in ten people over the age of 55 believing that showing emotion is a sign of weakness. In fact, older adults appear generally more resilient, with two fifths of people over 55 saying it has been longer than a year since they cried because of anxiety, or that they have never cried due to anxiety.
Gender also played a big role in responses to anxiety. Women are three times more likely than men to have cried because of anxiety in the last week, but they were also twice as likely to feel better for having cried. Women were also twice as likely to hide in the toilets at work if they felt anxious and half of women said they would eat more if they felt anxious compared to two fifths of men.
Perhaps most worryingly, only half of people polled agreed that anxiety could be a mental health problem. In fact, nearly one in twenty people currently experiences anxiety on its own and one in ten has mixed anxiety and depression. Anxiety has now become level with depression as the most common reason for calls to Mind’s Infoline. In 2014/15 alone there were 6,087 calls about anxiety and panic attacks, which accounted for nearly one in six of all calls.
If the symptoms of anxiety – such as feeling tense and restless, breathing rapidly and getting light headed, or having persistent negative thoughts – aren’t addressed and become severe, they can have a serious impact on day to day life. Problems sleeping, lowered immune system and depression can all develop as a knock-on effect and can get to the point that it becomes difficult to hold down a job, maintain relationships or take pleasure in life.
Mind is urging people to respond to symptoms of anxiety in themselves or those around them by texting ‘ANXIETY’ to 70660 to receive a free copy of ‘Your guide to stress and anxiety’ or visit mind.org.uk/getyourguide.
Juliette Burton, 30, is a writer and performer who has experienced anxiety since she was very young. She said: ‘I have lots of ways of coping with my anxiety, but sometimes I find the best way is simply to be in touch with what I’m feeling at that moment and have a good cry about it. Just having a good sob can help me accept my anxiety and move forward.’
Paul Farmer, Chief Executive of Mind, said:“Many of us lead busy, stressful lives and sometimes it can feel like things are spiralling out of control. Although it might seem tempting to put on a brave face, it really is OK to cry. It’s time for us all to stop holding back the tears and reach out for support. Responding to symptoms early is vital so that they don’t become more serious and complicated. There are simple steps we can all take to manage our anxiety and one of these is to text ‘ANXIETY’ to 70660 to receive your free Mind guide. As well as explaining what anxiety looks and feels like it also tells you exactly what you can do to tackle it.”
¹ Polling was conducted by Populus who interviewed 2,063 GB adults online between 8 and 10 May 2015
Stats on age:
Four fifths of 18 to 34 year olds feel they have to put on a brave face when they are anxious (79 per cent)A fifth of 18 to 34 year olds have cried in the past week because of anxiety (20 per cent)A quarter of 18 to 34 year olds feel that showing their emotions is a sign of weakness (27 per cent)One in ten people over the age of 55 consider showing emotion is a sign of weakness (10 per cent)Two fifths of people over 55 saying either it has been longer than a year since they cried because of anxiety, or they have never cried because of anxiety (42 per cent)Stats on gender:
Women were three times more likely than men to have cried because of anxiety in the last week (18 compared to 6 per cent)Women were twice as likely as men to feel better for having cried (63 compared to 29 per cent)Women were also twice as likely as men to hide in the toilets at work if they felt anxious (36 compared to 15 per cent)Half of women said they would eat more if they felt anxious compared to two fifths of men (51 compared to 42 per cent)

Mental Health in Students

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



The Student population is amongst the highest effected by mental health problems in the UK.
Adademic succes in young people is at an all time high, and yet this is overshadowed by the troubling prospects of mental health vulnerability. Stress in the number one problem. Emotional health can become very delicate and lead to further physical problems such as aches, pains, ulcers, IBS, eczema and weight gain. This is severly unerrepresented in the media and therefor often becomes overlooked.
A lot of this suffering goes undiagnosed as people often don’t understand what they are going through and the constant pressure of University being ‘the time of your life’ can lead students to resent themselves for lack of enjoyment and ignore negative thoughts.
Being homesick is also a major issue. The majority of students leave home for the first time for Uni and underestimate how drastic a change they are putting themselves through.Anxiety can begin with the build up of moving out and leaving loved ones behind, leading to panic attacks and insomnia induced by fear and unfamiliarity. Social anxiety is also high up among problems within the student community; new situations such as taking public transport in an unknown place, and the promise of having to confront strangers through their classes. This can result in missing valuable contact time because they cannot bare to face unfamiliar situations.
Mental health problems are on the rise within our young communities and people are suffering without help, effecting their social lives and education.Learning to cope and understand symptoms is just the beginning, young people need to learn not to be ashamed of their problems or shy away from opening up to others.There is nothing wrong with admitting what you are going through, and nobody is ever alone in their suffering. We strive to remove the stigma of Mental Health and work to help those in needs, so nobody goes through mental illness alone.

Improve Your Sleep

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Sleep is vital to our role as human beings. it is the back bone of our routines , and without it we start to slip into disease, injury and a lower quality of life. Sleep deprivation is very common, It would seem we underestimate the position of sleep within our lifestyles and yet undeniably we struggle to exist without it. Around 40% of people suffer from insomnia, and most people in Britain sleep less that 7 hours a night. This might even seem a lot to some people but it is actually on the lower level of what is necessary to fuel a healthy body.
Some commons tips for improving sleep are;

Exercise early in the day - When you work out really does make all the difference
Make sleep a priority. -There is nothing wrong with taking a nap, having an early night, or a lie in. This won’t make you lazy.
Switch off electronics- An easy solution.
Sleep aids won’t work forever-sleeping pills aren’t a long term answer
See a specialist- There’s plenty of people out there to help you, living with sleep deprivation doesn’t need to happen.

Living Life Service are offering a new 4 week course on ‘Improving Your Sleep,’ The course will help people understand their difficulties around sleep and build up a tool kit to improve their sleep routines as well as their thoughts and attitudes towards sleeping.
The course begins on Monday 28th September, 6-8pm,Newport Community Hub, St Paul’s Road.

Bipolar Disorder

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Bipolar disorder, or manic depression is a serious mental health disorder that causes extreme shifts in mood and energy levels. It can swing from one extreme to the other and can lead to heavy periods of depression where you feel low and lethargic, to a sudden burst of mania where you feel euphoric and happy; even overactive.
The disorder alters depending on the person, some suffer symptoms for weeks on end, whereas others may vary quickly and feel they never experience a ‘normal’ mood. Bipolar is often diagnosed as ‘clinical depression’ initially until a future episode of mania is experienced, when bipolar will then be diagnosed. People can often suffer from overwhelming bouts of depression, which can lead to severe self-neglect and even self-harm and suicidal thoughts.
During a manic phase, a person can be full of ambition and ideas and hope, people can spend vast amounts of money they can’t afford or wouldn’t normally think to. Symptoms such as not needing to eat or sleep and talking very enthusiastically and quickly can occur. Creativity can blossom in these periods but often can be accompanied by psychosis, such as hearing voices.

Bipolar disorder effects one in every 100 adults at some part in there life
Bipolar can occur at any age, but most often between 19 and 24
Everyone who suffers from bipolar, suffers differently

It is important to recognise the symptoms specific to you and be aware of any possible triggers, which may occur. Many options are available for sufferers such as medication from doctors; often these are mood stabilisers and can be taken every day. Psychologists can help, as can alternative therapies, as well as lifestyle advice such as regular exercise, planning activates and improving your diet and sleep routines.
There are lots of people going through similar problems and there’s always help available. We can provide you with advise on how to ease the symptoms and support groups to help get your life back on track. We also have our ‘connect recovery college’ with a range of courses to help you start making changes.

The Most Common Mental Illness: Anxiety Disorder

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



The world health organisation has discovered that the most common mental illness in the world is Anxiety Disorder.
4.7% of the British population suffer from anxiety and 9.7% from combined anxiety and depression problems.  These statistics are staggering and yet mental health vulnerability still goes unnoticed in so many people.  
And, this isn’t a first world problem, and by no means a new one either. 
Anxiety disorders are in the top 10 reasons for disability world wide, because mental health does not only effect our heads, but can lead to serious physical problems including back pain and self harming.
There are 6 main types of Anxiety Disorder:
•Generalised Anxiety Disorder- Long-lasting anxiety not specific to a situation or object.
•Panic Disorder- Quick hit of terror often flowed by trembling and difficulty breathing.
•Obsessive Compulsive Disorder- Repetitious obsessions and compulsions
•Social Anxiety Disorder- Intense fear in and of social interactions managed with avoidance. 
•Specific Phobias- Fear of a situation or object
•Post Traumatic Stress Disorder- Anxiety from a traumatic experience
36% of people experience symptoms of an anxiety disorder for 10 years before seeking help. A few symptoms include:
•Constantly on edge
•Shortness of breath
•Insomnia 
•Pounding heart
•Sweating
•Fears remain even when you know the outcome
•Avoid everyday activated due to anxiety
If you find yourself suffering from an anxiety disorder, its okay, you’re not broken.  You can still live a full life alongside an anxiety disorder and in fact lots of well known and famous people such as Sigmund Freud and Johnny Depp suffer from anxiety disorders, but this doesn’t stop them achieving and being brilliant! 
Anxiety is normal, but realising you suffer from a disorder is very important in order to accept your problem. It is normal to be self-conscious and feel embarrassment, but once you start avoiding situations in order to escape these anxieties, it might be time to seek help. 
There are lots of people going through similar problems and there’s always help available. We can provide you with advise on how to ease the symptoms and support groups to help get your life back on track.

People with mental health problems put off of sport because they are not ‘gym body ready’

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


New research, released today by Mind shows that four fifths (80 per cent) of people with mental health problems who do not take part in sport, are put off because they feel self-conscious about their bodies. Nearly 70 per cent of people told Mind that they feel their mental health makes taking part too difficult. The findings come as Mind launches Get Set to Go, a new programme to support 75,000 people with mental health problems to take up sport.
Mind’s poll, of 660 people, found that four fifths of people don’t feel confident in their sporting ability. Get Set to Go, supported by Sport England and the National Lottery, will help people with mental health problems become more active through sports projects at eight local Minds. People taking part will receive one-to-one support from others with shared experiences, who understand the additional challenges a mental health problem presents to those who want to get active.
Of those who do take part in sport, more than one in five say it is because their GP or another health professional had recommended it, while more than ninety per cent participate because it is good for their mental wellbeing.
Nearly three quarters (72 per cent) of people with mental health problems say they enjoy taking part in sport, or exercising, however around nearly two thirds (64 per cent) are worried about taking part in sport by themselves.
Paul Farmer, Chief Executive of Mind, the mental health charity, says: “Our research shows that people with mental health problems do want to participate in sport, however feelings of low self-confidence, exhaustion or fear of crowded spaces are preventing them from getting started.
“We want more people with mental health problems to be able to enjoy exercising and Get Set to Go will help people to better look after their physical and mental health through sport. Our online community, Elefriends, is also a great place to find support and advice from others with mental health problems who use sport and exercise to stay well.”
Mike Diaper,Sport England’s Executive Director Community Sport, said “The research released by Mind mirrors our own which shows that concerns over body confidence, ability and the fear of judgement hold people back from doing sport and exercise. Our own campaign This Girl Can seeks to liberate people from these issues so they can get healthier and more active.
“This is why Sport England has committed National Lottery funding to this exciting programme, Get Set to Go. Mind really understands the people it serves – and how to help them – which makes them an ideal partner. Sport has the power to improve the lives of people with a mental health problem and we’re confident that this programme will really benefit people who take part in it.”
Mind’s research also revealed a perception amongst respondents that you need to look a certain way to participate. Over half (55 per cent) of people told the charity they are not ‘gym body ready’, saying they are not members of sports clubs, gyms or leisure centres, because they are embarrassed about their body shape or size.
Statistics also showed that:

Sixty two percent wouldn't feel comfortable talking about their mental health with other members.
Fifty seven percent of those who are not members say it's because they would feel uncomfortable talking about their mental health with a coach or instructor.
A third of respondents with memberships to sports clubs, gyms and leisure centres concede they would not want anybody to know about thir mental health problem.

Twenty-three year old Claire Greaves dances to manage her anxiety, and says: “I used to shut myself away not spending time with anyone or doing anything but I knew that I enjoyed being active. I remember worrying about walking into a new dance class and fearing people would stare at me or I wouldn't be able to find where I was going. My mind threw a hundred excuses as to why I could not go. I wouldn't be good… I would make a fool out of myself… I found that when I actually did it, it was absolutely fine!
“I felt a bit uncomfortable walking in to my dance class but it's okay to feel uncomfortable. Everyone gave me a warm welcome and once we started dancing my focus was purely on that; I managed to tell myself that everyone was focusing on themselves too.”
Get Set to Go is now running in eight areas in England*. Mind has also published new information about how to get started with physical activity and how sport can improve physical and mental health. To refer, for more information or an informal chat please contact - Andy Birks, Sports Coordinator, Get Set to Go, Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.01642 644116andrew.birks@middlesbroughandstocktonmind.org.uk

New Course - Improving Your Sleep Routine

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



We have an exciting new 4 week course to help all you unhappys sleepers improve your patterns.  60% of adults don’t get enough sleep, and its no wonder when we have such busy lives these days. There are always things to keep us awake at night. But some people struggle more than others. This is why we are providing a new course to help you get the most out of your night time nod.  
Heres a few little tips to get you started; 
• Drinking a glass of wine before bedtime can make you feel nice and sleepy, but actually encourages abnormal sleeping patters. (damnit.)
• The darker the better! No monsters will appear if you sleep in the dark, we promise!
• Turn of your electrical gadgets and gizmos at least half an hour before you pap out. Them emails can wait until morning!
• Have you tried yoga?
• Don’t be afraid to take a nap, (we don’t judge – but we might be jealous!)

News from REACH

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



The REACH team have some exciting projects planned for the children we work with to keep them busy over the summer holidays. For the children in years 5 and 6 there is a two week summer school running from the 3rd to the 14th of August. We are providing a range of activities in partnership with local clubs and services including Middlesbrough Football Club and My Place. Children will be taking part in sporting, musical and creative activities, including digital story-telling. They will also have the opportunity to build confidence, teamwork, responsibility and communication skills with a fully trained Forest Schools instructor who will take them outside and teach them how to make dens and light fires in a safe and sustainable way.
For our children in year 6 who are making the transition into secondary school we are putting on two transition days designed to enhance their confidence, resilience and wellbeing during this challenging time. Children transitioning to Acklam Grange and Trinity College will be taking part in a series of workshops at their future school on friendships, coping skills, emotional wellbeing and problem solving.

Mens Health Awareness Week

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Men are known to be shy about expressing their health problems. Unlike women, they are far less likely to discuss their private issues over a cup of coffee with the girls.
Although the notorious ‘man flu’ may make this difficult to believe, ‘Men’s Health Week’ is a time to raise awareness for those who suffer with more than just a bad cold.
Often Mental Health is an issue overlooked in men, so this week is a perfect time to raise awareness and promote good health.  
People’s mental health is delicate and alters regularly due to all manors of things.
Mental wellbeing isn’t just about thinking positively. There are many different aspects in life that can get us down and make it hard to focus on day-to-day living. We are not always in control of what happens in our lives and this is scary! No wonder sometimes we go a little off track, and nobody is to blame.
As a society we need to learn to be more mindful of ourselves and learnt to read and understand our own bodies and minds; taking care of your mental health is just as important as physical health. Sometimes its as easy as having someone to talk to, or taking a little break from normal proceedings. Sometimes, it takes more and can have a larger effect on our lifestyle and we need bigger supports in place.
We offer mental health support groups for all different problems, or even if you just need a chat. Our friendly staff and volunteers are always there to help and encourage openness and comfort to those suffering with mental health problems.

Challenging Mental Health Stigma in Middlesbrough 

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 



On Friday we had a wonderful morning showcasing the results of a years work challenging Mental Health Stigma in Middlesbrough. Joined by Middlesbrough Council's Public Health Department we were able to present the amazing results we have achieved over the past year.
Last year public Health Middlesbrough recognised that people with a mental health problem/illness in Middlesbrough experience prejudice and stigma in all aspects of their lives. Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind were appointed the stategic lead provider to work with service users to challenge attitudes towards mental health. 
We started a Discussion and Action group connecting professionals, users of service and volunteers. The members developed strong bonds through the sharing of experiences. The common ground disccovered, raised members confidence to speak out and be more expressive about views on stigma. 
The members of the group put together a calendar of events for the year which included:

Men's awareness day hosted by Sporting Chance
Time to Change village at Sunderand Airshow
Depressed Cake stall at the Town Meal
World Mental Health Day celebration in Middlesbrough Town Centre
Time to Talk Day - Human Library at Central Library, Middlesbrough
Better well-being roadshow in the community hub
Supporting MRT celebration events with Depressed Cakes 

In total this group organised and participated in 21 different events in 10 months engaging in approximately 1,119 conversations about mental health at those events.
We are pleased to announce that we have been awarded another year of funding for this project, and hope to bring a bigger and better approach to challenging stigma in Mental Health.

Post-natal depression in men

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Typically, if you heard the phrase “Post Natal Depression” you would probably assume that it was referring to mums of new babies but despite the fact that this difficult mental disorder occurs more frequently in women, it does also happen to men.
Approximately 10% of mothers suffer from postnatal depression whereas only about 1 in 26 men experience it after having a child. That is not to detract from how serious an illness postnatal depression can be. This can affect not only the mental wellbeing and life of the sufferer but also that person’s significant other and their child as well.
Dads getting postnatal depression is much more common than we probably all think in fact a recent study showed that over 20% of fathers have a depressive episode at some point after the birth of their child.
There are many things that can be done to treat and help both fathers and mothers with postnatal depression but the biggest problem is diagnosing it and making people who may fall victim to it feel as though they are not a taboo subject and that the things that they are experiencing happen to a lot of people and are best dealt with when spoken about freely and openly.
If you or someone you know is suffering from any form of depression then why not get in touch. We listen, we understand and we help. Give us a quick call on 01642 257020.

The Human Library

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 



The Human Library is an international project that aims to do away with prejudice, stigma, and discrimination by challenging individuals to break stereotypes and be their own 'Book for the day'.We held the event at the Central Library in Middlesbrough and it turned out to be a resounding success with a great turnout. It was a fabulous success for tolerance and understanding.Here is what some of our attendees had to say about the day:"I honestly cant thank you enough for letting me be a part of it. As soon as I got home I told my mother all about it and she thought it was fantastic…..i couldn’t wait to tell more people.""Thank you for letting me be a part of it. It was brilliant. Such a good idea to get different people interacting and a fantastic way for these people who wouldn’t normally meet to potentially make friends."
"I gained a lot on the day as there was a very diverse array of readers. I met some health care staff who will be coming to my peer group to see how it is running and one who is a ward manager who is looking to run a group as well." 
"The concept itself was a novel way to challenge stigma and certainly a good one. Whilst I don’t consider myself to have any stigma towards mental illnesses or many of the other titles available to loan, I knew very little about many of them. This is primarily due to my being afraid that to ask people with, for example, depression more about their illness would offend or upset them. Therefore, the opportunity to listen to people’s in depth descriptions of their own situations and to ask any questions I wanted, was appealing to me, and useful in helping my understanding and increasing my knowledge."We are so glad that the event went so well and would like to thank eveyone for taking part!

Growing up with anxiety

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



The Prince's trust annual youth survey has found that more than 1 in 10 young people are suffering from anxiety problems.
The survey reports that 13% of 16-25 year olds are often too anxious to leave their homes, and unemployed young people in particular are 50% more likely to encounter the condition.
It is common for young people to grow up with anxiety and not know how to deal with the condition or who to approach for help. The limited support and understanding of mental health issues means that this problem will continue until there is a significant change in the perception and treatment of sufferers.
Anxiety in social situations is particularly common in young people but it is important to remember that anxiety can affect people in a variety of ways, for example through fear of getting hurt or losing a loved one. Some may be afraid to leave the house because they need to look after a family member, others may worry about things like paying bills and having enough money for food
This recent survey reinforces the fact that a mental illness can seriously alter a persons quality of life. Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind promise to continue providing support and information on mental health so that over time these alarming statistics will start to improve. We believe this will happen once there is a wide spread understanding of mental illness and better care provided to people that are suffering. We urge those to remember, that regardless of your circumstances, you are not alone.
If you think you could be suffering from anxiety or another mental health condition, do not hesitate to contact Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind, we will always be here to give support and advice.

Be a book for the day! Join us for the Human Library

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Imagine a library where books are people and reading is a conversation…
The Human Library is an international equalities movement that promotes social contact and respectful conversation to challenge prejudice, exclusion and discrimination.
The Human Library enables groups to break stereotypes by challenging the most common prejudices in a positive and humorous manner. It is a concrete, easily transferable and affordable way of promoting tolerance and understanding.
On the 5th of February we'll be hosting the Human Library in the Central Library, Middlesbrough from 10.30am - 3.00pm. 
Would you like to take part and be a 'Book for the day' or just help out on the day? We'll have training days for those interested on the following dates:
29th January at Know Your Own Money, Middlesbrough and 3rd February at the Central Library; both from 10am - 3pm. 
For more information contact Sarah Jane Ashcroft: SarahJane.Ashcroft@middlesbroughandstocktonmind.org.uk

The festive period can be a difficult for people even without throwing in Mental illness

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Let’s be honest – even if you’re not suffering from any mental health issues, the festive period can be stressful and often disappointing. We run ourselves ragged buying gifts, cooking, decorating and entertaining. Tempers flare as we’re thrown together with relatives whom we see infrequently, and don’t necessarily enjoy spending time with. 
When you are suffering from a mental health issue it’s a total different ball game.  The idea of doing all this festive stuff while you’re not yourself  is beyond overwhelming. Shop for Christmas presents? You’re having trouble getting out to shop for food! Decorate the house? You don’t even know if you’ll get laundry done so you’ll have clean underwear tomorrow. Send out Christmas cards to 50 of your closest relatives and friends? What would you say in them – “Doing awful. My new pastime is staring at the ceiling.I can’t wait till the holidays are over. Don’t bother to call. By the way, Happy Holidays!”.
Doesn't quite work does it? 
It’s miserable to be unhappy during Christmas so if you are talk to us. We listen, we care and we understand.

Me Carers Craft Group & Depressed Cakes on the road!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



We couldn't help but sneak a peek at the Me Carers Craft Group last week. They've been busy bees creating lot's of lovely things for a craft and cake event that is happening in December.
The crafters will also be joined by the Depressed Cake Group, who are going from strength to strength, to provide Middlesbrough with a Christmas craft and cake extravaganza! 
Both groups help their members to meet new people, get rest bite and support, and get the creative juices flowing! 
The events will be happening on the 2nd and 17th of December, visit our Facebook page to keep up to date with all the goings on at M&S Mind and The Living Life Service.

Ageing better project kicks off

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Last week we had a really successful meeting with key stakeholders and local older people as we disscued our ageing better project. 
The events used service design activities to help us to understand what is important about the design of the services and how the different ageing better projects should look and feel.

Great success at World Mental Health Day

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 



Last Friday we hosted a brilliant event in aid of World Mental Health Day. With the support from Moving forward Middlesbrough, Know your Money, Time to Change, Middlesbrough Recovering Together and the Samaritans, Teeside and all our wonderful volunteers we put on loads of fun and interactive activities in Middlesbrough Town Centre.
Mental health awareness is one of the biggest challenges facing both public and private health institutions across the globe and we were lucky enough to have a whole host of events going on that enable people of Middlesbrough to engage and interact whilst learning about mental health and well-being.
Time to Change piloted their new social interaction model called 'So-Me' which aims to encourage people to interact face to face with people in the style of a social network. Our fab Depressed Cake Group were also at the event decorating biscuit emoticons, and pupils from Middlesbrough College made loom bands.
We want to say a massive THANK YOU to all our fabulous volunteers, all the organisations and everyone else who helped make the event a great success.

Anxiety: Blogger Sunday Girl shares her experience

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 



It's almost midnight and I most definitely should be tired by now. Usually I am awake until about 10 o'clock before nodding off but this weeks a bit more stressful for me. Somebody who doesn't have a day to day problem with anxiety may not understand this topic so I apologize if this comes across as over-reactive to some of you haha!
August has been a pretty miserable month for me, knowing that at the end of the month John, my wonderful boyfriend, is going away for a week and I won't be able to see him. Some people would probably think 'So what? It's only a week' and then other people who suffer from anxiety may think they're world has ended like myself..
I am writing this post to share my tips on dealing with anxiety when you cant have access to somebody who makes you feel at ease and calm. Right now I actually don't have anxiety, I haven't this week thus far thanks to these tips that I will share but I have only just learnt them from my counselling sessions building up to this moment. When learning that John was going on holiday, I automatically thought seriously negative thoughts. Like 'What if the plane crashes?' or 'What if he forgets me?' or 'What if he gets hurt over there?' - all extreme thoughts which I convinced myself was going to happen, therefore all month I was having panic attacks, planning that my week without him would be so miserable and lonely which made my entire month miserable and no doubt made him feel bad for even going which should not be the case* at all. (Pardon the pun)*
I knew that I shouldn't be worrying about him, I am not his mum at the end of the day! I knew that but I still couldn't help think really negative thoughts which made me feel so anxious over the entire thing. If anybody else has or is experiencing this then I hope these tips that I have been doing really help you. I don't know anybody with anxiety so if I was to confide in my friends they might not fully understand why I am worrying so much. I hope to find more people who suffer with anxiety by making these posts and also sharing my tips on dealing with it in the small chance of it helping someone else.
From going to see a counselor, I quickly realized that I was explaining the entire situation from a negative point of view. Like I was planning already to have a miserable week. I was planning for Johns plane to crash and I was planning for him to forget all about me when he was away. I learned that I can put as much energy into thinking positive about things than I do negative. Which is hard when you have a bad habit of doing so! So when ever i thought I'm going to be lonely, I thought of ways to not be lonely...like working six days a week haha! Keeping busy is a great way to help anxiety because you're not sat with your thoughts rushing around your head making something into a bigger thing than it originally would be.
When ever I thought about Johns plane crashing...which stemmed from the recent plane incidents plastered all over the news...I thought about why a plane crash is on the news. Because they are so rare! It's much more dangerous to travel in a car then by plane so thinking this made me see the realistic side to my thoughts and made me understand how extreme it actually was.
When thinking about John 'forgetting me' while he's away I now try and think that I am overeacting and I have a bond with him which will be hard to forget. I understand this may seem really over the top to some readers but its just the way I am! You've gotta play the hand you were dealt!
I also started to think about how having a nice week to myself would be nice and to relax in my own bed :) Also by going to work I would be earning money to go towards another holiday with him ha!
I hope this has helped somebody in some way! I've written this post for my viewers as well as myself. It's like getting something off your chest!
The blog Sunday Girl is written by Anita Wheeler who blogs about eveything from fashion to baking, beauty to more pressing issues like Anxiety.

Middlesbrough's most socially isolated older people to benefit from a £6 million grant from the Big Lottery Fund

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 



We are happy to announce that Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind will receive a £6 million grant from the Big Lottery Fund to lead a partnership of voluntary, statutory and private sector organisations to help up to 10,500 older people in the town. The partnership will target their work in 11 of the town's 21 wards: Gresham, University, Park, Clairville, Beechwood, Ladgate, Kader, Hemlington, Coulby Newham, Pallister and Beckfield.
The Middlesbrough partnership will use outreach workers who will work with local organisations, businesses and clubs, such as community police and libraries to identify socially and contact isolated people to agree plans to improve their wellbeing. Work will focus on older people with health issues, who live alone or who are carers. Psychological support will be offered in people's homes.
Older people will be engaged in activities to support others who are more isolated to build their confidence. Volunteers will learn to use digital technology and social media to share their skills, focussing on people who have been made redundant, retired and finding it difficult to adjust, or unemployed for a long time. Other older people with skills they have gained during their lives will be encouraged to set up clubs for other older people, such as woodwork clubs for men.
'This is the kind of opportunity and investment we rarely dare to dream about. It will give Mind and our partners the opportunity to work along side more than 10,000 people aged over 50 in Middlesborough to tackle the causes of loneliness and isolation.' - Emma Howitt, Cheif Executive of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.
Welcome to Ageing Better Middlesbrough starting summer 2015.

Offender mentoring hub launched

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



A dedicated mentoring hub, called Justmentoring, has been launched, targeted at linking offenders with high-quality support to get their lives back on track and halt the cycle of crime many find themselves in. The Justmentoring website will, for the first-time, give prisoners or offenders in the community quick and easy access to a range of mentoring services. They will be able to find help addressing the root causes of their offending, such as drug and alcohol addiction, homelessness, unemployment and mental health issues.
Reoffending rates have barely changed in a decade despite spending £4bn a year on prisons and probation. More than 58 per cent of prisoners serving fewer than 12 months go on to commit further crime within a year of release.
The Government recently set out a raft of radical reforms to the way offenders are rehabilitated to tackle these high reoffending rates and strike a balance between punishment and rehabilitation. The plans could see every prison leaver serve a minimum of 12-months supervision in the community and the creation of a network of resettlement prisons so nearly all offenders are released into the area in which they will live and be supervised.
Mentoring is a major part of these radical reforms and the Justmentoring service will bring offenders together with organisations offering quality services.
As part of the same project, 200 groups working to mentor offenders have received support to reach the Mentoring and Befriending Foundation's  ‘approved provider standard’, with the aim of bringing greater quality-assurance to the sector.
Our Prison Mentoring Project was the first project to achieve this standard and we were presented with our certificate at the Justmentoring launch in June.
Have a look at the Justmentoring website at www.justmentoring.org.uk

We need some better answers

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


Last week I spent a fair bit of time thinking about the mental health of older people.
It started when I supported Lucy, a colleague, to put the finishing touches to the new Reablement Service project page on this website. She talked to me a bit about the project. ‘Mainly I’m working with older people with long term conditions. They are having their physical health issues addressed in lots of ways, but the impact on their mental health is less obvious sometimes, and gets forgotten. Often experiences in hospital have left them confused, upset and traumatised. Other older people just need someone to talk to about how they are feeling’.
Co-incidentally in the same week I had an honest and heart breaking conversation with my Grandad. My Grandad Harry is 83 and by most people’s standards he lives a comfortable life. He has my Grandma, close family nearby and no real money worries. Following a series of physical health problems over the last few years I had noticed Grandad Harry becoming more withdrawn and depressed. He was often emotional or angry and he had lost his confidence. He didn’t trust his legs or his balance and the psychological effect this had on him was becoming significant.
This changed when Harry was referred for physiotherapy sessions, and following successful therapy his name was put forward for a new older person’s group in the hospital. This group met twice weekly and they had guest speakers giving them information about issues that were relevant to them, from crime prevention to how to choose the right shoes to prevent falling over. Then they did a session of exercise and physiotherapy together. Grandad Harry loved this group. He talked to me last week about the benefits of attending. This ranged from the more obvious ‘it got me out of the house on my own’ and ‘it was great meeting new people’ to the slightly less obvious (for me anyway) ‘I had to prove myself to the group, and keep up with the activities, I didn’t want to be the one who dropped the rugby ball or the one who sat down first’ which made sense as he was rugby player in his youth. Grandad Harry talked to me about the other people he met, the friends he made and the bond they shared. Then he became upset. The group ended two weeks ago and won’t continue as it was a time limited pilot. Apparently it is hard to find the right old people to get a group like this together. Grandad became emotional when talking about the gap there would now be in his life. He said he already feels less steady on his feet than he did when he was going to his group. He expressed his sadness that they couldn’t find a room, some chairs and tea making facilities for the group to continue. Grandad was more saddened by the fact that ‘everyone in the group wanted to keep meeting up, they were such a great bunch of people’. What struck me was despite the presence of a loving family he was describing himself in a way which I would usually term ‘socially isolated’. Naively It had never occurred to me before that he would benefit so much from peer support.
I did my best to explain. There were four medical staff involved in delivering the group, some of the older people required special transport to get there, and the money and time that this all costs. It was hard to see him upset and it was hard to see him already losing his confidence and motivation. Then I thought about the older people out there who are struggling with the same feelings that my Grandad is, some of whom are much more isolated with less natural support.
As Big Lottery Fund launch a new investment in England that will improve the lives of older people, with the aim to reduce social isolation among this group, there is hope that the issue of older people’s mental health is becoming more of a priority. As an organisation we have many services which support older people, with the reablement project spearheading the way as a local pilot. But we could also be thinking about new ways to engage older people in talking about their mental health so that we don’t make assumptions that we know what is best for them.
I have asked my Grandad to write down his experience of his group, how it helped him to recover and the impact now that it has ended, so that at least his voice can help those people holding the purse strings to understand what is important and what makes a difference.
The Mental Health Foundation estimates that Between 10–16% of people over 65 have depression. An estimated 2–4% have severe depression. The questions about whether we are doing enough to support people in their old age are not new, I think we just need some better answers.

Ready, steady,....BAKE!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


I put on at least 2 pounds last week baking and tasting cakes cooked by our staff (and colleagues from partner organisations) in our very own Comic Relief Bake off. We raise just over £150 for a great cause, which is fantastic.
Big thanks to Carly, from The Olde Young Tea Shop in Middlesbrough, for being our independent judge.
Although our staff seemed, at first, reluctant to join in, they were obviously just keeping their talents under wraps as we had 23 beautiful entries including cake, cookies and cup cakes.  The winning cake was banana, peanut butter and chocolate.
After the judging cakes were sold in our social centre and to staff, and given free as dessert in our Thursday lunch club.

Ask your PCC candidates about disability hate crime

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


It took me a while to catch up with the Police and Crime Commissioner agenda but now I'm seeing information about these important changes it in lots of places (and have my polling card at home).
I went to a husting this afternoon, organised by the voluntary sector, to find out what Cleveland candidates had to say. If you get chance to speak to any of the candidates, be sure you ask them about their commitment to tackling Disability Hate Crime. The Guardian reported recently on the rapid increase of reported disability hate crimes; this has to be a good thing - people speaking up about what's happening to them, expecting the Police to investigate and protect them. We have good support systems in place locally and Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind is a hate crime reporting centre,although not may people come forward through us.
Have a look at the Disability Hate Crime Manifesto written by 'The Hardest Hit' campaign group and make sure you ask local PCC candidates to commit to continuing to support this work.

Excitement and relief, in that order

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


This shiny new website isn't the only exciting thing to happen here in the last week. Last Friday we also started our new Mind Psychological Therapies service. Check out the details on our Mind Psychological Therapies page.
It's been in the making for more than 9 months. I remember thinking about how it could work out whilst on holiday in January, so it’s been a long process and in my head for a while. We've all put masses of work into the preparation (big thanks to Jane, Lucy and Anne); it's a relief that it’s finally time to start and it's going to be brilliant!
One of the challenges is a new contract with the NHS. It’s one of the new NHS 'Any Qualified Provider' contracts. This means any organisation that meets the qualifying criteria gets a contract. Previous arrangements meant one organisation held the contract. On Teesside now, 6 organisations will begin providing the service, so people have a choice of where they go. Choice is great, providing people have all the information they need, of course.
We will be competing for customers, and will have to improve our marketing and make sure people know about us. This beautiful new website will help! We are absolutely committed to delivering the best service we can, but there's a risk under these arrangements that some other services might go for quantity rather than quality. If you're thinking of using a service other than ours, watch out for this.
It's also risky for a small charity like us because we're employing staff and don't know how many people will come through our door, or how much income we'll generate. But we're all committed to making it work because but it's easily the best opportunity we’ve had to provide really high quality therapy and improve people's well-being and quality of life - and that's what we're about.
I answered the main phone line at our offices on Friday and spoke to someone who'd been given our leaflet by her GP. I felt sure we could help and that makes it all worthwhile.

What a day!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



On Wednesday Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, as part of our physical activity project #Get Set to Go, entered a team into MFC Foundation’s second annual Social Inclusion Football Tournament at the Herlingshaw Centre. Our players have all been attending weekly football sessions as part of MFC Foundation’s ‘Think with Your Feet’ social inclusion programme.
Teams at the tournament included Wrexham, Carlisle United and Lanchester, as well as Durham Dynamos, Sunderland and Hartlepool United from the North East. Local organisations, Lifeline, and Men Tell Health were also involved, as well as other sides representing MFC Foundation’s Think With Your Feet and Imagine Your Goals projects..
We were so proud of the players who represented Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, they had an amazing team spirt and conducted themselves fantastically well throughout the day. Special mention goes to Nathan who scored a ‘worldy’ in our second game and our goalkeeper Andy who made some fantastic saves. Thanks also to coach Chris, player coach Scott and the non playing ’Get Set to Go’ participants and volunteers who came along to cheer us on. As usual Adie kept us going with his bad jokes, although the other players will be pleased to know we may have negotiated him a free transfer to Everton.
Massive thanks also to MFC Foundation and in particular Claire Streeter Social Inclusion Co-ordinator who organised the event and even provided our players with MFC strips to wear. We all made new connections with other teams and organisations and had a brilliant day, we cant wait for next year!
The Active Choices team, representing Derby County Community Trust, were the overall winners, beating last year’s winners Everton FC Imagine Your Goals en route to a 1-0 victory over Rotherham United Community Sports Trust in the final. Meanwhile, Barnsley’s team prevailed in the second ‘League Cup’ strand of the competition. Well done to everyone who took part!

The way we talk.

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


The way we talk about mental health plays a huge part in shaping our attitudes towards it. Alongside providing support to any individual in need, here at Middlesbrough and Stockton mind it is incredibly important to us to continue to raise awareness of mental health and the increasing need for support. It is wonderful to think how far we have moved over the past twenty years. Attitudes have changed and opinions developed, however we are fully aware how far we have left to go.
This week we’ve been talking about the specific language we use to discuss mental health. Of course this is not to say we are policing what language we should use, we have simply noticed a delicate change over the past few years, a wonderful indication proving that attitudes are changing. An interesting turn of phrase we often used to hear went along the lines of, ‘are you suffering ‘with’ mental health?’. Of course, as a greater amount of people came to understand more about mental health, this phrasing has faded away. We do not suffer ‘with mental health’, as we would not state we suffer ‘with physical health’.
We all have mental and physical health in different states of well being. Mental health, just like physical health, needs to be cared for, looked after and treated when in need. There is no difference. It’s these changes in the way we talk about mental health that continue to demonstrate how attitudes, opinions and understandings are changing. It’s wonderful.
Of course we do not write this to discuss censorship issues, or in a hope of policing the language used when discussing mental health. Everyone is free to discuss mental health how they choose, but the discussions we see online and across the media have noticeably changed over the last twenty to thirty years.
The wide range of support available today is so pleasing to see. So today we are looking to the past, reflecting on how far we have come and to the future, to how far we can and need to go.

Ten simple ways to reduce stress

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


Dealing with stress is challenging and finding ways to combat stress is completely unique to everyone. Our bodies and minds are beautifully unique so it's important for you to find your perfect method, unique to your body. Here's ten ideas to help reduce stress -
1. Avoid caffine, alcohol and nicotine
Although you may feel you recieve a short term relief, that is the problem - it's only short term.
2. Indulge in physical activity
Proven time and time again, pysical activity releases those happy endorphins and you will feel better for it!
3. Get more sleep
You need to recharge so allow yourself the sleep your body needs.
4. Try relaxation techniques
There's so many out there we could write pages! Do a little research and find the method suited to you.
5. Talk to some one
Sometimes it's the last thing you want to do but sharing your thoughts with another can really release a lot of worry. If you don't feel like speaking to someone face to face pop them a message.
6. Write, draw or read
Allow your mind to be somewhere else for a few moments and immerse yourself.
7. Take control
This means something different to everyone. For some of us it could be writing a list, for others it could be taking on that task thats you've been putting off. Whatever it is, find it and take control.
8. Manage your time
Making sure you leave yourself enough time throughout your day wether it be for work or to put the washing on can make a huge difference.
9. learn to say no
Remember to look after yourself. If you need to say no, remember to.
10. Rest
Finally, make sure you rest. Giving your body the proper time to recharge is invaluable.

He decided to pick Mind for his chosen charity and explains that he fully agrees with our vision to not give up on anyone experiencing a mental health problem and give them the right support and respect.
We were really pleased Andrew decided to pick Mind as his charity and so we asked him a little bit more about how running has helped him personally and also some advice for anyone starting up running.
From a young age Andrew has always been a keen runner.
“My Dad encouraged me to get into running when I was younger. I went on to join a local running club and met new friends with similar interests.”
Andrew now runs in his spare time as a way of staying fit and healthy. The north east features a great mixture of places to run such as the country side, the city life or even the seaside so Andrew can always find a place to run.
“I love varying my routes when I run, the North East is perfect for this. I can go from hilly off road routes, to running miles along the beach. The beach is probably my favourite place to run, running on the sand takes away some of the strain from running on the pavement and it can also be quite relaxing running by the sea”.
Andrew believes that taking up running can definitely benefit and stimulate the mind. If anything is worrying him, a short run relieves his stresses and he can feel his mood is improved for the rest of the day. Not only does running help him mentally, he believes running always gives him more energy to do other activities.
“The feeling of improving and increasing your fitness is a constant result of running and this can also help the mind as you gain a sense of achievement.”
So we asked Drew any advice he’d give for anyone thinking of taking up running!
• I would definitely encourage people to join a local running club, it gives you the motivation to train harder and it also allows you to meet new friends.
• Another option is to take part in your local 5k park run, these are free events all over the country which start at 9am every Saturday. The park run is open to runners of all abilities and is a great way to track your progress with your results being posted online.
The Great North Run will welcome thousands of runners, joggers, walkers, elite athletes and fancy dress heroes.
On Sunday Andrew hopes to beat his best time which is currently 1hr 18mins 5 sec. We think it’s so inspirational to do running as a hobby but also compete in well-known marathons while fundraising.
“I would definitely like to raise money for Mind again in the future”
Andrew’s next aim is to take part in a marathon so he would definitely make an opportunity to raise even more for Mind! He agrees that next time he’d like to raise money for his local Mind charity which of course is Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.
We wish Andrew the best of luck on Sunday and you can watch the Great North Run on BBC One from 9.30am.
Andrew has beaten his target of £300 but if you would like to make a donation, click here!

Gary Rowlands raised £50 for us in his first ever race!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 
Caption: Thank you Gary for raising such a generous sum for us!



It’s always great to see people actively fundraising for our charity, so when Gary got in touch with us we just had to share his inspirational story.
On Sunday 4th September, Gary Rowlands participated in the Sabic 3K Fun Run and completed the race in just under 18 minutes. For such a great achievement, we felt it was only right to thank Gary. Gary raised an incredible £50 for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.
Gary was only recently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder in February and suffers with anxiety and depression. He felt this Fun Run was a way to help with his mental health and to keep himself fit and active.
Gary has achieved his target of £50, with the help of his family, and this event has given him the confidence to run longer distances. He even sees himself running in bigger races such as the Great North Run!
Gary said this about why he decided to raise money for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind:
“I feel I am giving something back to people who have helped me”.
Gary has always volunteered in charity events and other races but this Fun Run was his first ever race.
The fact he chose Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind for his first fundraising means a lot to us and we look forward to seeing Gary’s racing progression.

Rebecca Earl raised £450 for us in her first fundraising event!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 
Caption: Thank you Rebecca for fundriasing for us, it was great to meet you!



Last month, Rebecca Earl ran a fundraising night all in aid of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind!
Her first ever charity event and she raised £450. With such a generous amount, we wanted to show our appreciation and acknowledge the work she’s done for us.
Rebecca has suffered with panic attacks and anxiety for about 10 years. We really admire her for taking the courage to come in and hand the cheque in person along with her friend who also suffers from anxiety.
The Mind fundraising night was hosted on 19th August and the night included a DJ, singers, raffles and prizes. Rebecca’s friends helped her with prizes which included MFC signed gloves, scarf and even an hour limousine ride with free champagne.
“I know how hard it is for funds, people who I know can hopefully get help from this too”.
After such a successful night, Rebecca hopes the money donated to Middlesbrough and Stockton mind can give a benefit to someone in the local area.
“I just want to take control and give something back, if I can help one person I will”.
Rebecca feels really proud about doing the charity event and it give her something to focus on and keep her mind active. She was so enthusiastic about our work and we found it so inspirational to see someone raising money for us and stepping into a new place.
She describes mental health as a chemical imbalance and that we’re not robots, we can’t function perfectly 24/7. Rebecca really wants to end the stigma around Mental Health and hopes this donation can make a difference.
“Just because you can’t see it, doesn’t mean it’s not there”.
Rebecca couldn’t praise Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind enough about the work we do and we really are thankful for her donation and kind words.
“Their little godsends, they don’t realise the huge impact they have on our lives, I just want to thank you all for the work you do”.

Mental Health awareness comes to Town!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 
Caption: Alright Middlesbrough showcases what’s on offer locally, to help people achieve healthier, happier minds.



Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind are working in collaboration with the Middlesbrough Mental Health Partnership to bring Alright Middlesbrough to town, our very own annual celebration of World Mental Health Day.
The Alright Middlesbrough event takes place on Saturday 8th October between 10am and 3pm in Centre Square.
It aims to recognise the importance of mental health and wellbeing with 32 stalls featuring 45 local voluntary and non-profit organisations, together with a marquee housing lots of fun interactive events.
It promises to be the largest mental health event Middlesbrough has ever seen.
World Mental Health Day itself is on Monday 10th October and this year’s theme is Psychological First Aid. This empowers the idea of treating our mind with the same respect as a physical injury and to explore the countless ways for better mental health.
Kerry Robinson, Deputy Chief Executive of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind said “We’re really pleased to be a part of an event of this size, in the heart of Middlesbrough. It’s great to be working with so many other organisations to really raise the profile of mental health and wellbeing for all".
"Mental health issues impact on all of us from time to time".
"We can often shrug our emotions off by saying things like “that’s life”, “I’m just really busy” or “there are people with much more to worry about than me”. Feeling stressed, anxious or low don’t have to be ongoing and significant factors in your day to day life – you can often learn to understand and manage these kinds of issues with a bit of information and support.”
"If you do feel you’re struggling with your emotional wellbeing then come along on to Centre Square on Saturday and find out what’s out there. I’m sure you’ll be impressed at the range of support and services available and you might be surprised to learn that there are lots of other people having similar experiences to you."
Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind will have three stalls on the day that will include taster sessions of our many services.
Children. young people and family’s service will deliver emotional support to all children and young people in the marquee.In Middlesbrough, two in every five children will have some form of emotional difficulty whereas the national average is one in every ten.
This local event hopes to break the stigma and allow people to be open about their mental health difficulties and to seek information for anyone struggling.
Recovery College will also provide a short course to help people manage their mental health difficulties with relaxation and breathing techniques. Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind offer a great variety of mental health workshops and courses to suit all needs.
Ageing Better Middlesbrough will be promoting better mental health and wellbeing for people over 50 in the area. Ageing Better Middlesbrough is working to reduce loneliness and social isolation for people aged 50 and over by inspiring people to lead active, healthy and happy lives.
The Side By Side programme will be promoting peer groups and activities in the area for people to get involved with. Bringing individuals together with mental health experiences to support each other through friendship and shared interests.
Other activities on the day will include face painting, laughter yoga, balloon modelling, cake stalls, smoothie making and even a kick about session with MFC Foundation. There will also be a reading / A&A from award-winning author Sean Borodale, author of Bee Journal, which is one of the Reading Agency’s mood-boosting books.
Alright Middlesbrough will even be raffling a signed MFC football shirt on the day.
All the stalls will be located in the area in front of the Central Library. A huge thank you to the team at the Central Library for working with us and providing space for a lot of local workshops inside.
With so many organisations such as Age UK Teesside, Headstart, Healthwatch Middlesbrough, Men Tell Health and lots more participating, Alright Middlesbrough is looking forward to the community saying ‘alright’.
You can enrol for the sessions online, for a full list of times and activities check out the Alright Middlesbrough website here.

Middlesbrough hosted it’s very own celebration of World mental Health Day on Saturday 8th October.
The Alright Middlesbrough event powered by the Middlesbrough Mental Health partnership and Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, gathered people in centre square, with over 30 stalls and a marquee, enjoying laughter yoga and mocktails.
The all-day event included 45 local groups and charities to showcase information, advice and free taster sessions to help people, including local MP Andy McDonald achieve healthier, happier minds.
Alright Middlesbrough had a whole host of fun activities on the day including; face painting, laughter yoga, Zumba, cakes stalls, smoothie bike and even a kick about session with MFC Foundation.
Award winning author Sean Borodale of Bee Journal, which is one of the Reading Agency’s mood-boosting books did a Q&A as well as a book signing. There was also a signed MFC Football shirt on raffle.
The theme for this year’s World Mental Health Day on Monday 10th October, was ‘Psychological First Aid.’ This was about treating your mind’s wellbeing with the same respect as you would a physical injury and exploring the ways you can mentally ‘keep fit’ and look after yourself.
The event was such a success and tackled the stigma amongst people in the town. People were willing to be open about their mental health difficulties and seek information for themselves and anyone struggling.
Kerry Robinson, Deputy Chief Executive of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind said, “the event had a really positive atmosphere. There was a real buzz about it and it was great to see so many diverse organisations working with each other.”
“Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind won’t give up in our efforts to improve the mental health and wellbeing of local people. This event is just one example of how we can raise the profile of good mental health and tackle the stigma so often associated with it".
“We’re really pleased to have been involved”.
Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind had stalls at the event promoting the range of services available for people. ‘The children. young people and family service’ offered a 10minute workshop on children’s emotional wellbeing whereas ‘Recovery College’ offered a taster session into relaxation and breathing techniques.
‘Side By Side’ offered people information on what groups they may want to take part in such as Raindrops to Rainbows, a group who supports mums with Pre/Postnatal Depression.
With so many organisations such as Age UK Teesside, Headstart, Healthwatch Middlesbrough, Dietwise and lots more participating, the local community said ‘alright’ to mental health.
Andy McDonald, MP enjoyed his day meeting local services and part-taking in the activities. He even joined Ageing Better Middlesbrough along with 750 members from the local community.
Mr McDonald said, “I am delighted to sign up in support of the Ageing Better Middlesbrough project. Mental as well as physical well-being is so important and even small things can make such a difference to people’s lives. Tackling loneliness and isolation is a vital aspect of achieving better mental health and I encourage everyone to be mindful of those around us who might need our help”.
Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind would like to thank Central Library for working with us and providing space for all the workshops, also a huge thank you to the local services and everyone who attended.

Volunteering for us has kick-started Katie's career goals!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            ,

Volunteering for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind has helped Katie Cartwright to gain the confidence to work with offenders for her dissertation and achieve First Class Honours, earn a VolunTees Award as well as gain the right experience towards a Forensic Psychology career.
Katie, who is currently beginning her Masters at Teesside University, applied for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind as her first voluntary position, starting in March 2015. While having an interest in Forensic Psychology, she believed the Appropriate Adult programme was the best route to engage with offenders.
The Appropriate Adult service provides support to vulnerable individuals with mental health issues or learning difficulties, who are detained by the police. Volunteers like Katie are required to attend police stations to ensure that detained persons are treated fairly, their welfare needs are met and they understand the procedures.
This opportunity was the passageway Katie needed to see if she would enjoy the specific field of work.
“Volunteering for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind has given me the confidence to engage with offenders and I knew I wanted to do this as a career”.
During her time at Teesside University, Katie dedicated her interest for this field by submitting a qualitative dissertation in the area of forensic psychology, specifically domestic violence. She interviewed eight domestic violence perpetrators for her study obtained by another third party organisation which resulted in achieving a first class. She believes she wouldn’t have had the confidence to speak to these participants if it wasn’t for her volunteering position at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.
Volunteering for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind also gave Katie the recognition of ‘Volunteer of the year Award 2016’ at Teesside University’s VolunCheers Awards (VolunTees Service). She also won Platinum Plus for over 250 hours’ worth of volunteering and training, she currently holds 302 volunteering hours registered on VolunTees.
Hilary Homan, Diversion and Resettlement Lead was delighted when Katie won the volunteering award.
“Katie has been so flexible and generous in giving her time to the service. She has dealt with some very serious cases and she provides a very strong non-judgemental attitude to the criminal justice procedures.”
Katie has worked on a couple of high profile cases with local police and she believes the respect you get from Police, definitely makes it worthwhile.
“It’s such a good experience, it feels amazing to think of the opportunities I’d of never thought I would have done”.
Detective Constable Pete Addison stated his gratitude to Katie who nominated her with a high profile case.
“Katie’s professionalism was exemplary; it was clear that she understood fully her role as Appropriate Adult. She is an excellent ambassador for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind and would be an asset to any team.”
“She clearly cares about the role of Appropriate Adult and I wish her luck in the future with her chosen career”.
Katie enjoys the variety you get with cases, two are never the same and they are all so interesting and different. As Katie starts back at Teesside University to begin her masters, she is planning to concentrate on her degree but hopes to remain in close contact with Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind and help with encouraging prospective volunteers to become Appropriate Adults.
“I definitely recommend anyone to volunteer for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, it give me the boost I needed to fulfil my chosen career path”.
Darren Johnson, Senior Lecturer in Psychology expressed that, “Throughout the time I have known Katie as an Undergraduate student at Teesside University, I have found her to have been a conscientious and hard-working student. She has presented herself as being forward thinking and creative, demonstrating her motivation to progress through her academic studies”.
“Her voluntary work with Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind has provided her with an excellent learning opportunity allowing her to apply her theoretical understanding as developed through her academic studies into practice. This experience will be valuable to her in the future and I hope she maintains her drive and positive attitude towards her future career goal”.
Katie aims to become a chartered Forensic Psychologist in the prison service after her studies. It’s great to hear how volunteering for our organisation has helped a passionate young woman kick start her career.

Meet Graham our gardener!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 
Caption: Graham has done a great job at renovating the garden!

 
Caption: Look how great it looks now!

 
Caption: Graham says with gardening, you are left alone to use your imagination!

 
Caption: He hopes to add young hedgehogs to the garden and has even made the habitats ready for them.

 
Caption: We can’t thank Graham enough for his hard work and contribution to our move In, Move On service garden.



Three years ago, Graham Wilson began his volunteering role at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind as a Mental Health Mentor. Since then, Graham has now took on the role as our gardener for our Move in, Move on service.
Move in and Move on is a residential service which provides housing for seven people for up to twelve weeks. While you are with us we will provide you with intensive, recovery focused support.
Before Graham started, the garden was very basic with very little foliage. He wanted the garden to be an inviting place where the residents can enjoy the view and get themselves outside.
As well as maintaining his own allotment, Graham visits our residential service every Friday with more visits during the summer. It’s great to see how much he has improved the surroundings with a shed, greenhouse, seating areas and even a vegetable patch.
“With gardening you are left alone to use your imagination”.
Graham has done exactly that but he likes to encourage the residents to get involved by picking what flowers they would like and has even took them to garden centres for ideas.
“I enjoy what I’m doing, it’s definitely a self-accomplishment when you see your ideas in real life”.
Graham has planted a great range of fruit trees in the garden including plum, cherry, apple and pear. The garden is filled with home grown produce so aside from the trees, the vegetable patch has also contained cauliflower, potatoes, turnip, onions and he even has a couple of tomato trees.
It’s all home grown for the residents to use and help themselves.
A lot of the gardening essentials have been kindly donated from Middlesbrough Environment City such as composts, the shed, greenhouse and even flower buds.
“We couldn’t make the garden as it is without Middlesbrough Environmental City”.
In the future, Graham hopes to add young hedgehogs to the garden and has even made the habitats ready for them. He is currently putting bird houses around the trees to encourage more wildlife.
He has also started creating a rockery made out of stones and logs provided by the National Trust at Ormesby Hall.Graham believes that gardening is a good way to stay focused and would like to encourage the residents to get more involved.
“With the struggles and problems they may have, gardening is something for them to focus on and it’s something in life”.
Aside from volunteering at Middlesbrough and Stockton mind, he is also as a support worker for Teesside Stroke club. He works with stoke patients of all ages young and elderly along with other volunteers to help them exercise and stay safe.
We can’t thank Graham enough for his hard work and contribution to our Move In, Move On service. He really has made the garden somewhere everyone can enjoy all year round and it’s inspiring to see someone so enthusiastic to make a difference for the residents living there.

Stephen Gale raised £150 for us in memory of his brother!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


It’s always great to hear people actively fundraising for our charity, so when Stephen got in touch with us we just had to share his inspirational story.
Last week Stephen Gale kindly donated £150 to us after sadly losing his brother Gordon in March this year.
Gordon was a part of our charity for over 20 years. Gordon went to our Time Out service, a weekly place for people to attend to do activities like bingo, listen to music and chat to other people with refreshments.
Gordon had a real passion for music says his older brother Stephen.
“He was like a walking jukebox”.
Gordon was described by a lot of our staff, friends and family as a human charts archive. It was quite unbelievable how much he knew about music. Everyone is gifted in other ways and for Gordon it was his ability to remember music release dates, chart history and even naming the tune.
Stephen said Gordon definitely had a photographic memory when it came to music. This was put to good use every Thursday where Gordon and Stephen would go to a local pub to play in the pop quiz.
“9/10 times we would win. His knowledge was so vast, he would know all the number ones when they were out”.
Stephen says Gordon had a great circle of friends and family but at times it was very difficult for him. He adapted very quickly to the care system and started to attend Time Out as a change of scenery.
Stephen and Gordon had a great brotherly bond through music. Stephen would buy Gordon any Album he wanted with his pocket money and they’d even visit concerts together. They have seen a great vast of iconic pop stars over the years such as Tina turner, the Kinks, Police and even the Rolling Stones.
“We’ve had some great laughs over the years together”.
Gordon’s music collection was very varied but his favourite decade had to be the 80s. Stephen thinks his collection was definitely over 500 from CDs to Vinyl.
“There’s a fine line between Mental illness and Genius” and for Gordon it was his knowledge of music.
He loved a lot of pop icons but one of his all-time favourites were the Beatles.
In Gordon’s memory, Stephen and his family and friends decided to sell Gordon’s collection and donate to some good causes. They sold his music in car boots sales and all the proceeds are going to a couple of charities including Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.
“He was a good human being, he never had a bad bone in his body”.
Stephen also expressed that a tree has been planted in memory of Gordon but the most heartfelt story he mentioned is his trip to Cambodia next month.
Stephen has visited Cambodia on a number of occasions. He visits the place to take clothes for the orphanages around the area. He told us about one particular family he become really close with. When he arrives next month, he’s going to use the money from Gordon’s collection to buy the family a cow, for sustainability.
It was so inspiring to listen to Stephens’s story and the family have even decided to name the cow after Gordon, in the hope they can live more sustainably and make a living to provide the children with the right education.
A huge thank you to Stephen and his family for choosing Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind to donate and it’s very motivational to hear about all the thought gone into the donations. Our deepest condolences with his brother Gordon, he is missed by all.

Tussle on Teesside fundraising night!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            ,

It’s always great to see people actively fundraising for our charity, so when Ralph got in touch with us we just had to share his inspirational story.
On 29th October 2016, Ralph Jordinson along with his best friend James Kelly, will be competing in Caged Boxing for the first time to fundraise for Middlesbrough and Stockton mind.
As part of combat challenge UK, Ralph (Halph) and James (Jimbob) will be hijacking the show for half an hour to ‘even the score’ while fundraising for a good cause.
Ralph and James have both fought each other around half a dozen times in Brazilian Jiujitsu competitions, but never with boxing gloves.
“We are raising as much money as possible for the local Stockton and Middlesbrough Mind - the mental health charity who offer counselling and support services to anyone who experiences any mental health issues from anxiety/depressive disorders through to suicidal thoughts and self-harm”.
Over a year ago, Ralph suffered with clinical depression. His life spiralled under life circumstances and now he feels he wants to give something back. We offered Ralph one to one counselling and he said it has really helped him get his life back on track.
“I wasn’t able to cope at all.”
Ralph was a competitive athlete prior to his mental health and competed in a lot of competitions. Getting back into sport, allowed him to keep focused and given him a piece of normality again.
Keeping his mind healthy through sport.
Brazilian Jujitsu is about taking an opponent to the ground, it aims to stop the fight. It’s not just about physical endurance, it’s also about keeping your mind focused on what your opponent may do next.
Ralph describes it as human chess, your that emerged into the game, so for that couple of moments he didn’t have chance to think about his depression.
He’s always been super productive and while working at MyPlace Middlesbrough, he also runs a youth project and coaches children in Brazilian Jujitsu.
Ralph is now stable and like all of us, still has his good and bad days. James feels like he got his best friend back and like Ralph, wants to help raise a lot of money by doing something different.
The Jiujitsu community Ralph trains with, have done lots of things for charity but this event is the first time he will be fundraising for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.
“Mental health issues really are hidden killers and there is so much stigma attached to the topic, with many people suffering in silence for fear of being excluded or lack of support”.
Ralph asks that “all friends and anyone interested, please give all you can for this great charity and the work that they do for anyone who has mental health issues and also raising awareness of these issues”.
The event will take place in Hartlepool’s prestigious Borough Hall on the headland. Tickets can be purchased from Halph and Jimbob for £25.
The night will also be raffling a number of prizes such as signed Boxing gloves by Multiple time K1 Boxing Champion Ernesto Hoost and a free years gym membership with Evolution Gym.
You can find more information and to donate here.

Meeting Miss Teesside 2016!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            ,

Caption: Sarah Gething now has three titles under her name including Miss Teesside 2016, Miss Charity 2016 and also Miss Publicity 2016.



We all struggle to cope at some point in our lives and that even goes for Miss Teesside 2016.
Sarah Gething popped into our centre this week and we just had to share her inspirational journey.
Prior to entering Miss Teesside, Sarah suffered with depression after being made redundant from her job. She felt she had hit rock bottom and lost all of her confidence in the process.
Sarah came to Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind for help and support and we worked with her for over a year to get her back on track.
“Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind re-engaged me into chasing my dreams, I lost focus but my counsellor motivated me. The sessions give me the confidence boost I needed to get out of that dark patch”.
In her early years, Sarah had been bullied in school for being a sporty girl. She felt she was left out and didn’t have place in a friendship group.
Sarah kept her mind focused despite the bullying and it all paid off when she became a semi-professional Badminton player.
Now 26 years old, Sarah currently teaches at Sunderland University as a Sports and Public services lecturer.
It was Sarah’s boyfriend who encouraged her to apply for Miss Teesside and she decided to give it a chance and see what impact she could make.
“I stood out for being different and it definitely paid off in the end”.
Being crowned Miss Teesside 2016 was a way to challenge the stereotype that all women need to look a certain way, or have a certain body type to be beautiful and prove that anyone can win if they put their mind to it.
Sarah now hopes to raise awareness of bullying and how it can impact a person’s confidence. She hopes that winning this pageant inspire others to feel confident enough to be themselves and to not buy into the media portrayal of beauty, to just be yourself.
Sarah Gething now has three titles under her name including Miss Teesside 2016, Miss Charity 2016 and also Miss Publicity 2016.
“Always follow your dreams, because no dream is too big”. Sarah’s next ambition is to attend Miss Europe in May next year and she’s really looking forward to it.
It’s so amazing to hear Sarah’s journey but also for her kind words on how our charity has helped her restart her career and build the confidence she lost.
“If you put your mind to it, then you can be who you want to be”. Sarah Gething is exactly that.

Elizabeth raised £1000 for us in memory of her sister!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            ,

Caption: Elizabeth hopes by telling Jane’s story, other people who may also be struggling will ask for help.



It’s always great to hear people actively fundraising for our charity, so when Elizabeth got in touch with us we just had to share her inspirational story.
Elizabeth popped into Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind and kindly donated £1000 to us. With such a generous amount, we wanted to thank her and her family for thinking of our organisation.
Earlier last month, Elizabeth Doyle and her family hosted a Birthday Memorial Celebration for her younger sister Jane. Jane died nine years ago and this memorial night was a way to celebrate what would have been her 50th birthday.
With over 200 people attending, the night was a way of keeping Jane’s memory alive and to celebrate her life amongst her family and friends. The night included raffles, bingo and tombola’s with prizes ranging from free gym memberships, food and drink hampers and vouchers.
Family members travelled from as far away as Ireland to be together at the North Ormesby Workingmens Club.
Elizabeth described Jane as popular and loved. She was always smiling and loved shopping.
“Every pair of eyes you look at, you don’t know what pain they are hiding. You don’t realise what people are going through”.
Elizabeth believes Jane had suffered with depression since she was a younger girl. She and the family had no idea that Jane was struggling so much with her depression.
From the outside Jane appeared to be happy and confident. Elizabeth hopes by telling Jane’s story, other people who may also be struggling will ask for help.
“I wish people would speak out, they feel like they can’t speak to anybody but they shouldn’t keep it in”.
Elizabeth and her family decided to donate the money they have raised to Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind to give something back to people with mental health difficulties.
“With mental health, it affects people from different walks of life, no matter where you come from, it can affect anyone”.
As well as donating £1000 to our organisation, Elizabeth and her family also donated a sum to the British Heart Foundation and Cancer Research UK.
Elizabeth feels strongly that more could be done to help people who struggle with mental health difficulties and believes that “a problem shared is a problem halved”.
“I hope this donation can make a difference and go towards making sure that people can get help when they need it”.
Thank you Elizabeth and your family for your wonderful donation and for raising awareness around suicide.

Get Set to Box!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 



Our Get Set to Go physical activity project has been having boxing sessions at Natural Progression Boxing Academy with coach Imran for over a year.
Natural Progression Boxing Academy is an ABA registered boxing academy, situated in the heart of Stockton and last week saw Get Set to Go participants complete another fantastic taster session. The Academy has 17 years’ worth of training behind its belt and trains people from the ages of 5 up to professional athletes. Their current oldest member is 60 years old.
Our sessions with Coach Imran include warm ups, instruction on the correct stance, balanced movement, work with pads and gloves and punch bags. The sessions are varied and fun with both men and women attending, we don’t get in the ring and fight each other by the way! Last week’s session concluded with Imran telling us about some of the great fighters adorning the gym walls and how they had overcome adversity to be successful in boxing and their lives.
Boxing is a fun and enjoyable sport and is suitable people with different ability and fitness levels. Besides all the physical health benefits, boxing can also be great for your mental health, some of our service users have classed boxing as the ‘perfect workout’. When you box, your body releases phenylethylamine, a chemical which helps improve your mood.
Boxing keeps you balanced while releasing tension and stress in your body and if you have issues managing anger, boxing is a great way to get rid of any aggression you have built up. It allows you to release those energies by taking your anger and any stress out on the punch bag or pads during your workout.
Boxing can get you excited about learning something new and as you concentrate on throwing the perfect punch outside stresses are left behind. It’s great for increasing confidence, improving self-esteem and meeting other people.
We asked last week’s participants to complete a short questionnaire before and after the session, here is a sample of the responses….
What has stopped you from trying boxing previously?
‘Worried that everyone would be very experienced and not open to newcomers’‘I was embarrassed to walk in on my own’‘Not knowing what to expect’‘The gym being too busy with no other girls’‘Not being fit enough’‘It’s too competitive’‘Meeting new people, I get anxious in groups’
How are you feeling before the session today?
‘Apprehensive’‘Nervous’‘I’m feeling tired with low motivation’‘Anxious about the unknown, the people, the gym and the activity’‘Stressed with traffic and parking’‘Lacking motivation but hoping the session makes me feel better’
How did you find the session today and would you come back?
‘Excellent, yes I would come back’‘Yes definitely I really enjoyed it’‘Yes, Amazing’‘Brilliant’ yes’
What was the best thing about the session?
‘Learning about the positions and how to do the different punches’‘Everything was good, all of it’‘The punch bag and working with my partner’‘Informative and fun’‘Punching the bags’
Would you recommend boxing to people with mental health issues and why?
‘Yes, because it can help people to release pent up stress and help them to relax’‘Yes, it releases endorphins and has relieved my stress’‘Its good fun’‘It helps you get fit and meet more people’‘It’s an excellent way to exercise, I felt very energetic afterwards, and it’s been a good release of energy and stress
Our Get Set to Go programme aims to improve the quality of life of anyone with a mental health problem through access to sport and physical activity in the local community.

Our Christmas in Mind Campaign!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind are getting you thinking this Christmas…
Christmas can be an emotional and challenging time for many people but a new campaign is being launched to help people who struggle this time of year.
The ‘Christmas in Mind Campaign’ is the first of its kind and aims to raise awareness of the mental health struggles people can face during the festive period and hopes to give a helping hand to those who feel lonely over Christmas.
The campaign, created by volunteers from Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, runs every day counting down the 12 days of Christmas, from 12th December to 24th December.
The aim is to encourage people to do acts of kindness for friends, neighbours or loved ones and get people thinking about the small things they can do. Taking time out to speak to people, especially if they are on their own and asking them if they are okay can go a long way to help someone have a happier Christmas.
Each day of the Christmas countdown, Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind will release mental health stories, guidance and opportunities online and through social media for people who want to do something to help others, as well as for people who are struggling themselves.
People will also be asked to join in by sharing their own acts of kindness and tips on how to cope at this time of year.
Anti-Stigma volunteer, Bethany turner, said: “we’re looking forward to helping people over Christmas and we understand the struggles people can be facing. I try to be thoughtful all year round but in the run up to Christmas I've handed out warm soup to homeless people around Middlesbrough town centre and donated some warm winter coats.'
'It’s nice to make a little bit of difference to someone in that situation'.
Other local services and organisations will be also be encouraged to participate by spreading the message and promoting the help that’s available to people as well as raising awareness in the workplace.
Chief Executive of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, Emma Howitt, said: “This time of year, with the pressure and stress of Christmas and some people celebrating without loved ones, I think it’s really important to let people know that they’re not alone. Lots of people do struggle this time of year but help is out there.
“It’s also fantastic to see local people get into the festive spirit of giving and the little things, like popping along to visit a lonely neighbour, that can make a big difference to people.”
Join in on the Christmas campaign with the hashtag #ChristmasInMind and see what individuals and organisations are pledging.
If you or someone you know is struggling or feeling lonely this Christmas, Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind offer a range of services to suit individual needs from one-to-one therapy to workshops. One programme, Ageing Better Middlesbrough is working to reduce loneliness and isolation for people 50 and over.
There’s always someone on the end of the line at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind on 01642 257020.

Reablement Service Winter advice & tips

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Christmas is fast approaching and the Reablement Service at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind are as busy as ever helping people to manage their long-term condition over this festive period.
Our service aspires to help people living with long term health conditions such COPD, diabetes, chronic pain, mobility problems or neurological conditions to manage their condition independently with the aim that they can develop coping strategies that can improve health and wellbeing.
We offer two services – Mind Reablement Service operates in Middlesbrough and also Redcar and Cleveland, whilst the Close 2 Home service works with clients from the Stockton area.
We welcome self-referrals, as well as referrals from professionals and other services. Most of our clients are seen in their own home, (eliminating the worry of getting to appointments) offering up to eight one to one sessions focusing on areas such as pain and fatigue management, relaxation and emotional support alongside rebuilding confidence and self-esteem; in fact, we tailor the support to fit around the individual, with our purpose being to help clients cope with their condition positively.
Christmas is a wonderful time of the year, people come together, exchange gifts and overindulge with scrumptious food. However, for those with a long-term condition it can be a difficult, frustrating and stressful time of year.
If you are living with a long-term condition that effects your mobility, getting out in normal weather can be a challenge, so negotiating icy conditions with mobility aids can be an extremely frightening experience. This can result avoiding to visits to see family or attend festive activities such as nativities, Pantos or Christmas fares. It can quickly become a time of loneliness and isolation which can impact on your mental wellbeing, triggering depression and anxiety.
Also as temperatures drop, chronic pain can get worse. Joint and muscle pain often become unbearable in cold environments, physical conditions such as arthritis can be much more problematic during the damp, cold winter months.
Our Tips: 
• Choose good non slip footwear when walking outside and ask family members or friends to walk beside you, for extra support.• Try to save a little extra throughout the year for those winter bills so you can have the heating on without worry – remember to claim any discounts from your energy suppliers.• Have lots of cosy blankets at the ready to wrap up warm and watch those Christmas movies!• Explain your situation to family and friends and perhaps invite them to come to your home to enjoy some festive celebrations – although keep it simple and relaxed so you don’t burn yourself out entertaining!

Caption: Making a worry Monster



2016 has been a very busy year for the REACH Children and Young People’s Team. We have celebrated receiving our 1,000 referral and have also secured a further 2 years’ worth of funding with HeadStart.
But what is REACH and what can we offer to you and your family?
REACH supports school aged children and young people with low level emotional difficulties. We work with young people that attend Middlesbrough primary and secondary schools. The majority of work we do is on a 1-1 in their school, our aim is to help young people to develop more effective ways of coping with their problems, such as controlling their anger, dealing with anxiety, improving confidence and self-esteem, overcoming bullying, dealing with friendship issues and coping with difficulties at home or school. Sometimes a young person just needs someone that they can talk to, sharing their worries and frustrations.
Group activitiesWe also work with groups of young people, during the last year we have hosted a variety of activities over the school holidays such as First aid, Team building, Multi-sports and Circus skills with partner organisations such as the YMCA and Middlesbrough FC Foundation. 
We have also delivered transition activities for Y6 pupils preparing them for secondary school, by delivering workshops on friendships, team building, problem solving and coping strategies.
What we have planned for 2017• Continuing to support more young people across Middlesbrough that are struggling to deal with their emotional well-being• On-going work with school staff in all of the Middlesbrough schools• Sharing our completed self-help books with young people
Top tipsWhat can you do with your family over the Christmas period to fight off stress?
• Get wrapped up warm and go for a nice walk with the family to a local park or woods• Take time for yourself, read a book, listen to some relaxing music or have a soak in a bath• Have a movie night and watch a classic Christmas movie• Play a board game with the whole family to bring the family together• Eat some feel good food, take time out to relax with a hot drink away from the stresses• Bake some yummy biscuits or delicious cupcakes with your family• If it’s miserable outside why not be creative and do some arts and crafts as a family. Have a go at making your very own worry monster

Teesside University students help us with our Christmas campaign!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            ,

Caption: Thank you for supporting us on our first campaign!



A group of enterprising students from Teesside University are challenging the stigma attached to mental health issues.
‘Christmas in Mind’, launched by Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind have involved four Teesside university students to aid with filming and promoting the campaign.
The campaign is the first of its kind and aims to raise awareness of the mental health struggles people can face during the festive period and hopes to give a helping hand to those who feel lonely over Christmas.
Teesside University students: Kyle, James, Lucy and Natalie, have supported the campaign from the beginning and hopes that the videos they have created, will relate to people and help them with their difficulties.
The campaign kick started on Monday 12th December and will run every day counting down till Christmas Eve.
The aim is to encourage people to do acts of kindness for friends, neighbours or loved ones and get people thinking about the small things they can do. Taking time out to speak to people, especially if they are on their own and asking them if they are okay can go a long way to help someone have a happier Christmas.
Sports journalism student, Kyle Wilson, said: “We’re really pleased to be involved in the Christmas in Mind campaign as part of our assignment. We’ve really enjoyed it, and it’s been a great opportunity helping a local mental health charity.
‘We hope the video will help local people, even if it’s just one person”.
We would like to thank the students for supporting us with our first campaign and its great to get students involved as this campaign is for everyone! We have been releasing daily mental health stories, self-help guidance, opportunities and the video to support people who are struggling.
You can find the videos here or check out our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. 
There's only 3 days left of our #ChristmasinMind campaign but you can still join in by using the hashtag and see what individuals and organisations are pledging.
If you or someone you know is struggling or feeling lonely this Christmas, Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind offer a range of services to suit individual needs from one-to-one therapy to workshops. One programme, Ageing Better Middlesbrough is working to reduce loneliness and isolation for people 50 and over.
There’s always someone on the end of the line at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind on 01642 257020.

Reablement Service Christmas advice & tips

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Last week we featured some winter tips from our Reablement Service, today they are providing tips for around Christmas time! 
With Christmas only a couple of days away, we often find ourselves rushing about trying to do a million things at once!
There are tasks like Christmas shopping, the wrapping of gifts, the decorating of the tree, and the cooking of Christmas lunch to contend with long before the Queen’s Speech - these responsibilities take up a vast amount of energy.
When battling with a long-term health condition, energy is a precious and limited resource; you may struggle to get showered and dressed each morning, so the idea of spending the day Christmas shopping or cooking the Christmas lunch would be the equivalent of running a marathon for most of us. Struggling with pain and/or fatigue can often feel overwhelming at this time of year.
There are so many limitations that are apparent when suffering from chronic illness and negative thoughts and emotions can start to creep in. You may feel guilty that you can’t complete tasks and must ask for help, yet this can lead to you feeling like a burden.
There is often a feeling of frustration that you can no longer do activities that you used to enjoy and must now sit back and watch others; like decorate the tree or bake festive treats. Having young children or grandchildren to entertain can be a struggle. Keeping up with the Christmas activities or playing with the children over the holidays can be physically draining and can impact on your emotions again because you feel like you are not able to participate fully.
Once again loneliness and isolation can be felt, you may feel you miss out on enjoying the day with family because of the exhaustion. Worry and anxiety around the cost of Christmas is often experienced if relying on sick pay or benefits as your main income.
Our tips:• Rest as much as possible before Christmas Day. Pace activities – do a small task, then rest for 10 minutes. The idea is to conserve energy as much as possible, so you can use it on doing the activities you want to do.• Do your shopping online rather than wasting vital energy on the high-street. It’s much easier from a laptop on your sofa!• Delegate – Ask for help and share out tasks.• Make tasks easier – peel the Christmas veg sitting down.• Christmas doesn’t have to be expensive – small tokens of appreciation or kindness is just as special as any material gift.Of course, Christmas is about showing love, caring for each other and being grateful for all the good things in life. Even though uncomfortable symptoms will go on, with good planning and an open mind Christmas can still be an enjoyable experience. Here are our final essential tips for making Christmas with chronic illness merry and bright!• Get your repeat prescriptions in early. Don’t run out of medication over the holiday period!• Plan your Christmas tasks. Spread things out over several days so you don’t have to do everything at once. You can prepare veg and freeze it days before you need it. Wrap a few presents each day rather than causing more pain and discomfort from wrapping a huge pile of gifts.• Simplify your Christmas celebrations. Don’t feel that you must stick to all the traditions, mix things up where you can, perhaps presents could be opened after lunch rather than the early morning, or maybe you could wait until evening to have your Christmas meal – who says you have to indulge in a lavish dinner with all the trimmings? Stay relaxed and spontaneous!• Try to socially connect with people to keep your spirits up. Cancelling on invites sometimes seems like the easier option, but keeping connections with friends and loved ones often acts as a distraction from some of the symptoms and reduces depression.• If anyone is stuck on what to get you for Christmas maybe suggest some complimentary therapy. Perhaps an aromatherapy massage, reflexology or some healing reiki to kick start your new year.• Remember - there is no such thing as a perfect Christmas! All families disagree over the TV, a mess is always made, there is never enough batteries in the house and we all forget a vital ingredient…some even forget to buy the turkey!
From everyone at the Mind Reablement Service – We wish you a very happy Christmas!

Why does Blue Monday exist?

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 

 



It’s easy to understand why Blue Monday exists... Maybe but why? January can be the most miserable month of the year due to the comedown of celebrations for Christmas and New Year, our bank accounts are begging for pay day and it’s still cold and dark outside.
Today, 16th January is Blue Monday. This is arguably the most depressing day of the year due to reasons mentioned above.
What we need to realise is, some of us have these feelings all year round not necessarily in January or even on this day.
So we’ve decided, rather than explaining why it’s ‘depressing’ we want to promote ways in which to feel better and to help your mental health and wellbeing.
We asked our volunteers and staff members what activities they like to do this time of year to beat the winter ‘blues’ and Seasonal Affective disorder symptoms.
• I swear by my slow cooker in the winter – I can just throw some ingredients in on a morning before work and when I get home I have a nice, hot meal waiting.• Lighting a scented candle always makes me feel cosy on a night.• I visit my local library a lot in winter so I always have something good to read.• Planning is key for me – I write them all down in my calendar so it keeps me occupied and have things to look forward to, so I’m less likely to sit at home feeling lonely.• I find walking by the sea or surrounded by the trees and nature really helps lift my mood in winter.• I begin sowing seeds this time of year, it’s something to look forward to watching the progress every day as their usually ready by summer.• I try to go for a walk every day in winter before its dark, it’s good to notice how nature is changing especially when you can see buds starting to grow.• I try to stay active and alert by maintaining my daily mediation practices.• I like to capture photos on my camera throughout winter, especially changing aspects of nature to see how the seasons are continually shifting.• I like to treat myself for a good meal out somewhere to blow away the cobwebs of dark days of the cold and miserable weather.• It may seem an odd thing to do when you feel blue but I always try to smile. There is actually evidence to suggest that smiling can make you feel better.
These are only a few examples of things you can do daily to help with your wellbeing, it can be as little as lighting some candles to going for walks and making the most of the daylight. Exercise has been proven to improve mental health so if you can find something you enjoy from nature walks to attending the gym, there is something for everyone.There is a lot to enjoy about the winter months and we hope you can find your own remedies and self-help rituals.Throughout this day we will be sharing lots of blue Monday content from inspirational quotes, blog posts and lots more so do check out our social media.

Calamity Jane Dementia-Friendly Screening 

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 
Caption: Calamity Jane



DEMENTIA-FRIENDLY SCREENING
Cineworld MiddlesbroughMonday February 27that 11am.Doors open at 10,30
Cineworld Middlesbrough will be holding Dementia-Friendly screening on Monday February 27th. Dementia Friendly screenings enable people living with Dementia and their carers to attend the cinema in a safe and comfortable environment, giving them the chance to get out and socialise.
Screenings are OPEN TO EVERYONE, but are enhanced to suit the needs of people living with dementia: During the film low lights are left on inside the auditorium, the volume of the soundtrack is reduced and it’s fine for members of the audience to express themselves.
The staff on duty for these screenings have become Dementia Friends to help provide support before, during and after the screenings, as well as making our venue generally more Dementia Friendly.
BOOKING: In-person at Box Office or at www.cineworld.co.ukWheelchair spaces are limited so please book in advance.Flexible refund policy in place for these shows.

It's time to talk about mental health

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Today is a very important calendar event for mental health charities. Thursday 2nd February 2017 is Time to Talk day.
A national campaign forwarded by Time to Change to make awareness of mental health and for people to start the conversation.
"Conversations about mental health change lives".
Although mental health should be talked about all year round, for people who haven’t spoken out, make today that day.
Here at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, we don’t want anyone to suffer in silence so take today to ask someone if they are okay or tell someone how you are feeling.
In time, we will break the stigma attached to mental health so like today, it’s important to make your own mental health a priority.
At the moment, too many people with mental health problems are made to feel isolated, ashamed and worthless by other people’s reactions.
But talking about mental health doesn’t need to be difficult. It can be as simple as making time to have a cup of tea or go for a walk, and listening to someone talk about how they feel.
Whatever the hour, every conversation, every text, every share means more people are reached and more lives are changed.
You can be a part of it. Today we’ll be backing this campaign from our staff, volunteers and even two local footballers from Middlesbrough football Club.
Being open about mental health and ready to listen can make a positive difference to someone’s life...

Childrens Mental Health Week 2017

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Growing up can be a difficult time for many young people especially with the vast changes that occur in their emotional, physical and social development. As it's Childrens Mental Health Week from 6th - 12th February 2017, we thought its only right we raise awareness and together we can make a difference to the future of children & young people...
Among teenagers, rates of depression and anxiety have increased by 70% in the past 25 years, particularly since the mid 1980’s. National research highlighted that on average 3 pupils per classroom are affected by such issues, however statistics reveal that as many as 2 in 5 children in Middlesbrough suffer from poor emotional health and well-being, which is higher than the national average. 
Here at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind’s REACH Team, we offer emotional support to children and young people that attend a Middlesbrough Primary or Secondary School. We see young people that are struggling with anxieties, have poor confidence and self-esteem, have difficulty controlling their emotions specifically anger or are experiencing problems with their relationships, including friends and family. Our service has received close to 1200 referrals, so its clear children and young people are needing the support more than ever.
“I enjoyed having someone to talk to because at the time I felt as though no one listened” Pupil. 
"We will always be grateful for the way you gave us our daughter back” Parent.
Tips for improving your child’s emotional well-being:

Do things as a family, whether this is playing board games, going on family days out, going for a walk in the woods or local park, baking with your child, being creative or watching a DVD.
It is important to do things together, making sure that everyone feels included.
Try to focus on positive behaviour and achievements your child has made rather than the negative.
Praise your child when they have done something well.
Talk to your child about any worries that they may have.
Help your child reflect about their behaviour if they have done something wrong or if they have experienced a difficult situation.

This awareness week has been backed by Heads Together and other mental health charities such as Young minds and Place2Be. Even the royals Prince William and Catherine have got involved in highlgihting the importance of good mental health in children by attending schools and promoting acts of kindnesses.
All year round, make sure you look after your own mental health and let someone know how your feeling such as your parents, teacher or even your friends. 
The more mental health is talked about as we're younger, the more we can break the stigma attached so any individual won't be afraid to speak up and receive the help they deserve.

We won a Volunteers Award

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind has recently achieved the Investing in Volunteers Quality Standard award, recognising the excellent work it does with volunteers.
The local mental health charity currently has over 60 active volunteers and working to benefit people with mental health problems.
Paul Christon, Service Manager, said: ‘We believe that our volunteers provide added value to the work we do through their skills and qualities. A lot of our volunteers have lived experience of mental health and we believe volunteering can be a part of their recovery as well as a way of helping other people through their recovery’.
‘We are delighted to have achieved this award for the second time since 2013. Our volunteers are the heart of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind and we are thankful that our volunteers have been recognised for their contributions’.
Investing in Volunteers is the UK quality standard for all organisations involving volunteers and aims to improve the quality of the volunteering experiences. Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind was assessed against a range of best practice standards and proved to excel in all aspects of working with its volunteers.
Katie Cartwright, Teesside University Masters student, said “I definitely recommend anyone to volunteer for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, it gave me the boost I needed to fulfil my chosen career path”.
Volunteering for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind also gave Katie the recognition of ‘Volunteer of the year Award 2016’ at Teesside University’s VolunCheers Awards (VolunTees Service). She also won Platinum Plus for over 250 hours’ worth of volunteering and training.
Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind currently has four opportunities to become a volunteer at the charity and welcome people from all backgrounds.
Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind believes no one should suffer in silence and if you or someone you know is in need of help, the charity can provide support and guidance.

Swift-Tees fundraise for life-saving kit

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



ONE of the region’s most popular venues just got a little safer thanks to some fleet-footed fundraisers.
A brand new life-saving defibrillator has been unveiled at Stewart Park following a charitable drive by some of the venue’s Parkrunners.
It’s a timely new addition as a similar machine saved the life of a Parkrunner in Nottinghamshire only last month, and the new kit will be available for use by any visitor to the Park.
Swift-tees runner and our own peer Rosanne Lightfoot got the ball rolling last year after reading an inquest report which brought to mind the sudden death from cardiac arrest of one of her son’s friends.
The Defib Fund was born, and in early December Swift-tees took over all the roles at the Stewart Parkrun in a fundraising drive that netted nearly £500.
Former Boro star Gary Gill provided a signed Boro shirt to raffle with a further £400 raised at the group’s Christmas party.
In just a few weeks the fund had topped £1,700 – enough to buy a first defibrillator and start the drive for a second machine.
The group now have their sights set on a defibrillator at the Habinteg Community Centre in Hemlington, another area popular with runners, walkers and footballers.
The Stewart Park machine was officially launched outside the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum by Gary Gill, Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland MP Tom Blenkinsop and Friends of Stewart Park Chairman Tom Mawston.
The trio were joined by members of Swift-tees and fellow runners from local clubs including NYMAC, New Marske Harriers and Marsh House Harriers who all helped in the fundraising effort.
The new device is housed in a vandal-proof cabinet fitted with a combination lock with the code only issued when a 999 call is placed to North East Ambulance Service (NEAS).
NEAS has also held the first of a number of defibrillator and CPR training sessions for regular park users and Askham Bryan College staff based in the Park.
Rosanne said: “Cardiac arrest can strike anyone with an undetected heart condition, and a defibrillator can mean the difference between life and death.
“That was clearly demonstrated when a machine that had only been in place for two weeks saved the life of Parkrunner in Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire last month.
“We wanted to raise awareness of the need for defibrillators at public places like Stewart Park, not just for the runners but for all users from dog walkers and children in the playground to people visiting the Farmers’ market.
“I’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the fundraising drive, and I’d like to thank everyone who has contributed – they may just have helped to save a life.”
Councillor Lewis Young, Middlesbrough Council’s Executive Member for Culture, Leisure and Sport, said: “The Parkrun at Stewart Park is a hugely popular event and has played a key role in our objective of making more people more active.
“Unfortunately from time to time medical emergencies do arise, and that’s when equipment like this comes into its own.
“Congratulations to Swift-tees for a fantastic fundraising effort, and I’m delighted that they’ve chosen to continue supporting such a great cause.”

Ageing Better Middlesbrough has hit 1,000 members!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Our free membership now has over 1,000 members who receive free quarterly newsletters and ‘What’s On’ activity guides about what’s happening in our town. We also have over 150 local organisations and groups who have joined to help tackle loneliness and isolation in Middlesbrough.
We work with people aged 50 and over in Middlesbrough to help reduce loneliness and isolation by connecting them to the community.
Helena Gordon, 63, member and volunteer with Ageing Better Middlesbrough says: “We may only give an hour here or there but never underestimate the value of that time. I feel part of the community and it’s a reason to get up in the morning.”
Loneliness and social isolation is common in older people and the impact is severe – it can have a negative effect on blood pressure, mental health, mortality and is also linked to depression.
The number of centenarians in the UK has quadrupled in the past 30 years, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. In the past decade alone, the number of people reaching the age of 100 has increased by 71%. The number of people over 90 has nearly trebled over the past 30 years.
As well as working intensively with the most lonely and isolated people to help them tackle the different issues in their lives that may be contributing to their isolation and loneliness, the team at Ageing Better Middlesbrough also organise events for members. Also offering free taster sessions has helped people try out new activities and make new friends. One recent event was a free lunch on Christmas Day. The lunch at St Mary’s Cathedral, Coulby Newham, was cooked and served for members who would have otherwise been on their own.
Member quotes from Christmas Day meal: “I’m very grateful for this, Christmas is a tough time. Christmas lunch was probably the toughest, so I’m glad of this.”
“Ageing Better Middlesbrough has changed my life after my husband’s death.”
Another member, Mabel McGurk, 92, has just been awarded the British Empire Medal. She is still volunteering at James Cook University Hospital and attends lots of Ageing Better’s free taster sessions.
Some of the exciting future developments for Ageing Better Middlesbrough are the 50+ Sports Day on 25th March 10am-4pm at Middlesbrough Sports Village and the development of Middlesbrough’s very own Men’s Shed with Groundwork’s North East.
If you or someone you know ever feels lonely you can call our team now on 01642 257030 or join as a member at www.ageingbettermiddlesbrough.org.uk.

Ali Brownlee Riverside Run 2nd July

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 
Caption: Limbering up for the 5k on the hallowed turf at the Riverside



THE Voice of the Boro will be heard loud and clear when one of the region’s most popular events returns.
The Ali Brownlee Riverside Run was first renamed last year in honour of the local broadcasting legend who died last February after a short battle with cancer.
The new name for the Middlesbrough 5k Road Race and 2k Fun becomes a permanent fixture when the event returns on Sunday, July 2.
Middlesbrough Council and leisure services partner Everyone Active are hoping for another record turn-out for the run which takes in some of the town’s most striking landmarks including Temenos and the Transporter Bridge, before a memorable finish beside the hallowed turf inside the Riverside Stadium.
Commentary for this year’s race will be provided by Neil Green and Amy Oakden, current hosts of the BBC Tees Breakfast Show.
In addition to being the distinctive voice of countless Boro commentaries, Alastair was a passionate supporter of the local RunMiddlesbrough events, completing the Tees Pride 10k himself and acting as race commentator for many races.
His energy and enthusiasm helped many a runner over the finishing line, and his sudden passing was keenly felt by a great many people across Teesside and beyond.
Speaking ahead of the official launch of the 2017 event on Wednesday (March 1) Alastair’s widow Wendy said: “I am really honoured to have such a wonderful and prestigious event named after Ali - he would be so proud.
“I know what this event meant to him, he was always excited when he was leaving the house on the morning knowing he was going to meet so many people and to be able to cheer and encourage each and every one of them on.”
• To register for either the 5k or 2k please visit www.runmiddlesbrough.comEntries are also being taken for the 2017 Taylor Wimpey Tees Pride 10k and 3k Fun Run which takes place on Sunday, September 3.

Meet our London Marathon Runner!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Fundraising can give you a sense of purpose and something new to aim for. Well how about taking part in a marathon?
On the 23rd April 2017, David Henderson will be doing just that at the Virgin Money London Marathon, with all proceeds going to Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.
This running event is a very important date for mental health charities, as the leading charity this year is no other than Heads together. Supported by royals The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, the campaign aims to end stigma around mental health.
The charity is partnered with Mind, CALM and lots more national mental health charities, so for a local runner to be taking part in this run in aid of our organisation - means a lot.
Ahead of April, we are going to follow David’s training journey up until the day with running tips and how he’s preparing for the great cause.
“Mental health is very important, but there is a lack of awareness of these issues in general. I think it is excellent that mental health is the leading cause of the London Marathon and it is great to see the whole Heads Together campaign being backed by the Royal Family”.
Thousands of people from across the country will be stepping in front of the starting point, wearing bright coloured charity t-shirts and crazy costumes and David will be part of this achievement. Raising as much as possible for our charity.
After seeing mental health promoted in his workplace recently, David felt it was the right time to take part in actively raising awareness and making a difference to his local community.
“The atmosphere should be great, I have done the Great North Run a few times and this should be something else”.
If you were inspired by David’s fundraising story, please visit our fundraising page to see how you can support us. You can also sponsor David on his fundraising account here.

Art Students tackle loneliness

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 



PHOTOGRAPHY STUDENTS HELP TO BRIDGE THE GENERATION GAP WITH CAMPAIGN TO TACKLE LONELINESS IN MIDDLESBROUGH.
Photography students from Cleveland College of Art and Design (CCAD) have been inspired by a generation spanning 76 years to create a marketing campaign which helps reduce loneliness and social isolation in Middlesbrough.
We set the students a live brief as part of their second year BTEC Extended Diploma in Photography course and we’re so excited by the results!
The brief we set the students was to tackle the stigma attached to ‘older people’ and to send a message that older people still have skills, still have a life and are doing amazing things in our community!
The students undertook research to find out how life is different between the two generations – such as technology, work, college – and through shared experiences were able to explore values which older people bring to the community.
To help create the campaign, four members from ABM – Janet Pyle, 92, Araf Chohan, 65, Stuart Brown, 64 and Helena Gordon, 63 visited the specialist art and design college to talk at length about their lives, where the students enjoyed finding out more about the four clients from four diverse walks of life.
The students facilitated the visit with refreshments and enjoyed the conversations with the group, followed by a photo shoot in the studios in which the use of technology was highlighted and the positive impact it has on their lives.
On the day we assisted the students as a client would, to help them gain different perspectives and develop ideas, and they took it really well and valued the input. It was fantastic to see a relationship between the young and the old develop over a cup of tea and a chat. Part of our programme is reducing loneliness and isolation using technology, keeping in touch with family and friends, and the students really picked up on that.
Janet, 92 from Marton took part in the campaign and thoroughly enjoyed herself. As someone who swims five times a week and plays Scrabble on her iPad with her long distance family, she was an inspiration for the students.
Born in Trimdon in County Durham, Janet’s husband was coal miner for 22 years and having lived all over the country, she came home to retire and be with family. Janet said: “The photos are great and it was lovely to work with students, they were so interested in our lives. I wish I had the same chance as the students and go to college!
“Seeing the posters is overwhelming and it captured a moment in time which is very natural, with everyone enjoying themselves, especially Araf. I love my iPad and play scrabble with my two sons and daughter in America, and also use it for talking every day.”
18-year-old photography student Nina Gibson, 18 from Yarm, said: “I loved talking to the group from Ageing Better Middlesbrough and learning about their experiences from years ago and what they do now. I was brought up by my Nanna and my Mum, so have spent lots of time with older people and I think it is rubbing off on me a bit as I enjoy Coronation Street and drinking cups of tea!
“Janet gave me a good giggle and it is like she is still 21 in her head, which is great attitude to have. It was a lovely project to work on and shows that people don’t change just because they are getting older. It has also inspired me to volunteer at ABM so it has had a real impact.”
Fellow student Elliot Moor, 18, from Heighington in Co Durham, said: “I did wonder what kind of stories the clients would have to tell – as ABM wanted to show that older people don’t just stop being interesting when they turn 50 – and the brief has proved this to be true.
“Araf was great to talk with, because of his books and his travels. He told us the story when he was a flight attendant on a plane that took a nosedive as it went over an active volcano, which was amazing and therefore we featured the photo in the campaign. You really don’t know the life that that a person has had until you explore further and it has been a learning experience for everyone.”
Courteney Johnston, 19 from Park End in Middlesbrough, said: “I was a little bit surprised when talking to the group, as you sometimes forget that they have had a life. I think they did learn something from us too, as one of them said their perception of teenagers had changed. Helena told me a lot about her life, including how she knits for premature babies, so I am really happy with the work and proud.”
After the visit and photo shoot, We went back into the college to meet with each group and give feedback on the campaign, to help support our branding and messages.
We wanted the students to think creatively about this project and be inspired, and they really have delivered. What has come out was totally unexpected and we especially love the short statements about what people ‘used to do’ and ‘what they do now’.
The images speak for themselves – how much fun we had on the day, how much fun the students had and how much they learned from the older people coming in was amazing.
Tim Leah-Adams, Photography Lecturer at CCAD, said “The students really enjoyed the opportunity to work with ABM on this brief as it gave them a real sense of working with a client in a business environment. The preparations that need to happen so that a shoot can go well, and the collaborative nature of working with others are a much overlooked but essential aspect of creative industries. This live brief gave the students this insight, helped them with their communication skills and has given them confidence to use the knowledge gained in their project work.”
The imagery will be used as part of campaign by ABM to be launched this Spring.

New Middlesbrough ‘Men’s Shed’ is open for business!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Are you a Man living in Middlesbrough with time on your hands?
Then come and get your hands dirty at the brand new Middlesbrough Men’s Shed! The aim of the new ‘Shed’ is to provide a place and the support required for Middlesbrough men of all ages and backgrounds who wish to pursue practical interests, learn or share skills and support worthwhile local causes.
Middlesbrough Men’s Shed will meet on a Tuesday morning from 10am – 12pm at Berwick Hills Community Allotment site on Bradhope Road, Middlesbrough (TS3 7BG). The pilot is led by Groundwork North East and Cumbria, but was developed in partnership with Ageing Better Middlesbrough and Public Health Middlesbrough.
The outdoor activities that take place at the ‘Shed’ sessions will be led by the desires and skills of the participants, who will be encouraged to develop their own ideas for growing activities, construction or maintenance projects that can be undertaken on the community allotment site. Projects might enhance the allotment or the surrounding area, or may even bring a little money back into the coffers of the project through the sale of items made.
Participants are encouraged to bring their skills and knowledge to the table, sharing these with others and hopefully developing new friendships and new skills along the way. The sessions will however be facilitated by Groundwork staff members, who will be there to support and help secure the resources and tools needed to hopefully make the ‘Shedder’s’ project ideas a reality. In addition local experts may be brought in to demonstrate crafts such as green woodworking or metalworking using a mobile forge.
Sarah Marrison, Senior Project Officer at Groundwork said “We like to think of our Shed as an extension of a normal man’s shed at home. It can be a place of solace to pursue hobbies, but our Shed can also be a place of company; a place to meet like-minded people and do something constructive with your free time whilst getting out in the fresh air”.
The pilot project has been lucky to receive funding from a number of sources including Ageing Better Middlesbrough, Public Health Middlesbrough, Thirteen Group, Tesco ‘Bags of Help’, One Stop ‘Carriers for Causes’ and Northumbrian Water.
For more information about Middlesbrough Men’s Shed please contact Sarah Marrison at Groundwork on 01642 815663 or email sarah.marrison@groundwork.org.uk.

Make this week the time to talk.

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 
Caption: The Anti-Stigma group with News Reporter Rachel Bullock



Monday 8th May – 14th May is Mental Health Awareness week and our Anti-Stigma group want you to start the conversation.

The Anti-Stigma group is a volunteering opportunity we offer here at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind and the members meet often to discuss ideas on how we can raise awareness and campaign for mental health difficulties.
Each member has an understanding in mental health whether they have direct experience, a user of services, through personal self-management or as a carer. Their goal is to change the public attitude towards mental health and break the stigma attached so anyone can open up to how they are feeling.
This years topic ran by the Mental Health Foundation aims to look at why too few of us are thriving with good mental health and ways in which we can change this. 
So in the last year the volunteers have organised a Christmas campaign, spoken to local radio stations and this week have a slot on ITV!
The volunteers have teamed up with ITV Tyne Tees to talk about their personal experiences and coping mechanisms they have found aid their recovery or that help them maintain good mental wellbeing.
Mental health is a part of life, not a taboo subject. With the likes of the Royal trio – Prince William, Catherine and Prince Harry and not to mention the amount of celebrities such as Lady Gaga and Stephen Fry opening up about their issues – we are starting to see a real difference.
"For some of us with mental health problems, it can be incredibly difficult to start a conversation about our struggles without a prompt. Asking somebody how they are, or letting them know you’re there if they’re struggling, can make it much easier to get the discussion started." Anti-Stigma Volunteer
"The only difference between people that talk about mental and those that don't is honesty. Everyone you ever meet is affected by their state of mind at some point in their lives, they just don't talk about it." Anti-Stigma Volunteer.
Throughout Mental Health Awareness week we’ll be sharing stories and updating our social media channels with lots of useful information and support so please check out our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
You can see our Anti-Stigma group on ITV News this Thursday at 6pm. If you would like to know more about the volunteering group or would like to join, click here.

Fundraisers aim high for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



40 fundraisers from the TTE Technical Training group, have set the challenge of completing the Yorkshire Three Peaks in 12 hours for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind.
On 29th June, the group of staff and learners will set off for their route of 24 miles with the hope of raising thousands for the charity, which provides confidential services for people who are experiencing mental health struggles.
TTE Technical Training Group is the leading provider of training to the process, manufacturing and engineering sectors and the majority of the students and staff are male. The fundraisers are hoping to raise awareness of mental health in men; so they can start the conversation.
Rory McIntosh, Curriculum Improvement Coordinator at TTE and organiser, said "Acknowledging mental health with men is important. Ironically you don’t think about it as often as we should. Anyone can be affected.
"We decided to pick Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind because it’s about educating our students on what mental health is and what help is out there if they are struggling".
At the beginning of the year the organisation hosted a cake sale in aid of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind and raised just over £100, which then created the idea of the ‘Yorkshire Three Peaks’ challenge.
Bethany Dean, Communications Officer at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, said, "We’re honoured to be picked as TTE Technical Training Group’s charity of the year and its inspiring to hear about the organisation raising awareness of mental health to their colleagues and students".
In preparation for the fundraising event, the grouphave been practicing the walking challenge around the local countryside, such as the James Cook monument and Roseberry topping.
"Everyone has mental health, at any giving time it can effect anyone especially with life changes and events."
If you would like to donate to the Yorkshire Three Peaks challenge, you can visit the groups fundraising page here.

How volunteering helped Lee with his anxiety! 

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Volunteers are a huge part of our charity and we want to make this week the opportunity to thank them all for their hard work and dedication.
Today we spoke to Lee our Admin support volunteer, to ask what volunteering means to him.
Aside from volunteering at Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, Lee regularly attends the park run and feels running with a team improves his mental health.
Lee originally came to our organisation to receive support for his anxiety a few years ago but after a keen interest in mental health and helping others, he decided to join our team as a volunteer.
“I had made a connection with everyone, I appreciated the support and felt I wanted to give something back”.
Lee has been volunteering for just over two years now and helps admin with referrals to services and now has a paid role working with our Ageing Better programme.
“It feels great being part of the team, all the staff are lovely. I feel part of the furniture”.
Lee is still recovering from his anxiety but feels volunteering helps him to get out the house and build his confidence. He’s opened up more to the staff while also learning new skills.
“Volunteering takes my mind off other things, it keeps me occupied and it’s been a key part in my recovery”.
Over the two years Lee has gone onto doing admin training to build his CV whilst making friends. Last year he also won a volunteering award for his efforts.
“Even though I’m still anxious sometimes, I see volunteering as a positive because I feel like improving in my journey. I would 1000% recommend volunteering. It opened new doors and it’s nice to feel appreciated”.
Lee is very passionate about the work he does for our organisation and we thank him for all the hard work and enthusiasm he’s put in over the two years. He’s a great asset to the team.
If this has influenced you to find out more about volunteering, why not apply now?

Volunteers Week

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



1st – 7th June marks Volunteers Week.
A week to recognise and celebrate the hard work and dedication volunteers make to organisations like ours.
Each year over 100 people support us by volunteering and that also includes our trustees.
Our volunteers generously give their time to help people with mental health problems. They are valued and supported as a vital part of our organisation.
Throughout the years we’ve had volunteers help deliver lunch club, help with admin and most recently support people in police custody and destigmatising the taboo around mental health.
For Volunteers Week, we want to make time to appreciate all the work our volunteers have done in the last year and celebrate their achievements.

Our volunteers have won awards, gained employment and also improved their mental health through volunteering. We support them through training and gaining experience for their aspiring goals.
Earlier in the year, we achieved the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) Investing in Volunteers Quality Standard. This highlights the contribution and commitment that our volunteers give. The Volunteers Quality Standard award also shows we provide
the best standards of good practice and support for all our volunteers.
Throughout the next week, we’ll be sharing volunteers’ stories on why they volunteer and what impact it has made in their daily life. Get involved by following us on social media so you don’t miss out.

Let’s hear from a couple of Volunteers:
“Volunteering allows me to get a heap of experience that I would otherwise not be able to get. It is satisfying and is perfect for me to do whilst studying. I get to apply theoretical knowledge that I have studied whilst discovering what the practical scenario of a police station looks like. Mind provides amazing support and I always have access to my volunteer co-ordinator. If you are thinking of volunteering then take a leap, Mind will guide you and train you.” Yathavi, Appropriate Adult volunteer
"What I get from being a volunteer is the best thing ever, helping others who need it, meeting new pals and gaining loads of experience thanks to Mind" Steven, Appropriate Adult volunteer
"Mind does amazing work, and it's fantastic to be a part of such as great group of people, who understand and who have similar experiences. It's important to break down the walls of stigma and misunderstanding." Iona, Anti-Stigma volunteer
"I have always had a passion to help people and by volunteering I like to think I have done just that, not just with Mind but with other organisations I have worked with. It all depends on what you're interested in but I cannot emphasize enough how beneficial volunteering is, whether it be for your career, your studies or even just yourself as a person. There's something out there for everyone" Mollie, Appropriate Adult volunteer
If this has influenced you to find out more about volunteering, why not apply now?

Carers Week

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Carers Week is an annual campaign to raise awareness of caring, highlight the challenges carers face and recognise the contribution they make to families in the community.
Taking place Monday 12th – 18th June, we want to focus on supporting carers to look after their loved ones well, while recognising the needs of their own.
This week we want to recognise how important caring is. We think carers do amazing work every day in Middlesbrough for the people they care for and we’re here to support you.
We offer a Carers and Families Wellbeing service to give people the opportunity to talk about their concerns and to give them a space to focus on themselves rather than the person they care for.
Caring for someone with mental health difficulties can bring unique challenges.
We understand this and give you the right support and advice to help you in the important role you play in that person’s life.
As part of the service, there is also a ‘Me Time’ support group where carers come together to chat and take time out of their week to focus on themselves.
The Me Time group meets on the first and third Wednesday of every month.
It’s a chance to talk about any worries they have and enjoy group activities such as coffee mornings and arts and crafts.
We spoke to Margaret who helps run the group.
“It has made a difference to my life. It is ‘me time’ and we get each other. We all have similar problems and it’s nice to know we’re not alone”.
Margaret says the group has done a range of activities such as crocheting, cross stitch and even Christmas decorations.
“People have different skills to show or teach. It’s so rewarding to see something the other person has achieved”.
If you would like to find out more about our service or how to join the group please speak to Jackie at carers@middlesbroughandstocktonmind.org.uk or 01642 257020.

Kick about for Men's Health Week

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 



Yesterday our Get Set to Go sports project took part in a football tournament for Men’s Health Week.
The two teams played in the first Step Forward Tees Valley Inclusion Tournament alongside MFC Foundation.
This 5-a-side tournament was not only to promote Men's Health Week but also to raise money for Prostate Cancer UK.
The friendly tournament featured games of walking football with ‘power play’ music periods where everyone could run around as normal.
We are very proud to announce that one of our teams reached one of the finals and we managed to win our first ever football trophy. Not only that, Nathan from the team was voted ‘player of the tournament’ by other team managers.
The participants has a great day and a huge thank you to Les Curvis from MFC Foundation and Martin Jones from Step Forward Tees Valley for organising the event, also to MFC Foundation for hosting and providing the referees.
Our Get Set to Go programme aims to improve the quality of life of anyone with a mental health problem through sport and activities in the local community.
This project aims to overcome the barriers someone with a mental health issue, may face when wanting to become more physically active.

Men Tell Health have been shortlisted for the UKs Largest Diversity Awards

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



Men Tell Health, a local organisation devoted to men and mental health based in Teesside, have been shortlisted for the Community Organisation Award (Gender) at the National Diversity Awards 2017.
They run a number of men-only support groups in the Tees Valley in Stockton-on-Tees, Middlesbrough and Redcar, all designed to be very different from the typical ‘supportgroup’. They use venues that are conducive to talking and offer a relaxed, informal, yet supportive environment for men of all ages, backgrounds, cultures and experiences tocome together and help each other.
Their success in reaching this point comes from over 22,000 nominations and votes which were received this year, paying tribute to grass root communities nationwide.
The prestigious black tie event provides recognition for excellence regardless of race, faith, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability and culture.
Gary Pollard, Men Tell Health’s Chief Executive, said “We are absolutely delighted and honoured to have been shortlisted for this prestigious award. For a small organisation like ours, it’s incredibly humbling to have been recognised at a national level for the work we do across Tees Valley to reduce male suicide and help men talk about their own mental health.”
Men Tell Health joins fellow north-east nominees South Tyneside Against Bullying who are nominated in the Community Organisation (Age).
Their unique approach to engage with men means that the way they use humour to destigmatise mental ill-health is a fresh approach in an area that has regularly seen the highest suicide rates in the UK. For more information, head over to Mentellhealth.org.

Get Set to Go Celebration!

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 

 



On 5th July our Get Set to Go project hosted a celebration event at Tees Barrage International White Water Centre in conjunction with our colleagues at Tyneside Mind and Tees Active. The event, attended by 70 people, was held to celebrate the achievements of participants, volunteers and sports providers involved with Get Set to Go, a programme designed to support people experiencing mental health issues to become more active.
The morning session consisted of options to experience 'Airtrail' the UK's biggest high ropes adventure course, or for those who preferred to keep their feet on the ground, a nature walk around Portrack Marsh Nature Reserve, expertly led by staff from River Tees Rediscovered and Tees Valley Wildlife Trust.
After a spot of lunch and certificates presented to volunteers on the project it was back down to the River Tees for powerboat trips and another nature walk. An amazing day was had by everyone that attended including the Mayor and Mayoress of Stockton-on-Tees. Special thanks to Tees Active and Tees Barrage White Water Centre, RiverTees Rediscovered, Tees Valley Wildlife Trust and the Get Set to Go staff, participants and volunteers who came from Tyneside to attend.
You can find out more from our sports project here.

Charity Boxing Night

            By Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind
            , 


 



It’s always great to see people actively fundraising for our charity, so when Michael got in touch with us, we just had to share his inspirational story.
“By raising money for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind, I am hoping that it can raise awareness of mental health issues and help it to become a subject that people can talk about more instead of suffering in silence”.
On Saturday 2nd September, Michael Wright will be putting on his boxing gloves for charity, alongside 40 participants, raising awareness of mental health in men.
“People don’t understand that just because you look okay, doesn’t mean you aren’t struggling. Men find it really hard to open up about their emotions because they don’t want to be seen as weak”.
To get himself prepared for the boxing match, Michael is working with True White Collar Boxing with 8 weeks’ worth of training.
Michael decided to choose Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind as his charity sponsorship as he felt people need to know where to go for support.
“I’ve always said to myself whichever charity I pick, it needs to be somewhere I can use and know people will need their help at some point in their lives”.
Michaels works in a male-oriented workplace therefore he’s extremely passionate about raising awareness of mental health so men, like himself, feel okay to start the conversation.
While training for the event, Michael believes setting yourself a goal and taking part in physical activity, will help in his road to recovery.
Hoping to achieve £1000, we wish Michael the best of luck in his fundraising efforts and if you would like to donate, you can here.

The Team








Trustees











Geoff Baines


I was born in Middlesbrough in 1959 and lived in Nunthorpe for 23 years until recently moving to Hartburn. 
I joined the charity's subsidiary trading company as a Director in October 2010, and was appointed Chair of the Board of Trustees/Directors of the charity in December 2011. My interest in mental health has been long standing, largely because of the history of depression in my family and also I have witnessed the massive growth of mental distress in the workplace in the last 20 years, temporarily offering myself. 
I have worked as a Human Resources professional since 1986, and I am a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development. 
My interests include watching the Boro, sports, current affairs, chess, music, writing, gardening, reading and dog walking!














Marian Ramsey


I was born and brought up in Middlesbrough. My interest in mental health is routed in my personal experience in my adolescence.
I trained as a Probation Officer and worked as a probation officer for about 15 years, until I retired from this work in 2007. Since then I’ve worked as an independent Social Worker with an interest in safeguarding, adoption and mental health. Working in women’s prisons, supporting women with mental health difficulties, really increased my interest in empowering vulnerable women with enduring mental health problems and resettlement of women from prisons and hospitals into the community.
I have been a trustee for over 7 years. It’s a really committed team, including trustees, staff and volunteers, and it’s a privilege to be associated with and able to contribute to the Charity.








John Harrison


Becoming a Trustee of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind was an opportunity to be involved in something a little different, to try to use my knowledge and experience for the benefit of others and thereby ‘give something back’.
To date I am fortunate enough to have very little personal experience of mental health problems and at the time of joining had little knowledge of the implications of mental health issues and the impact they have. I am now aware how wide ranging these problems are and of the value of providing support to those directly and indirectly affected.
During my time as Trustee I have seen Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind grow significantly to become a large and well respected organisation and it is satisfying to be associated with it and to witness the fantastic support the staff and volunteers provide to the local community.
Apart from my three years at University, I have lived in Redcar all my life and have been a Boro season ticket holder for most of that time. I also enjoy most other sports and travelling with my wife Chris mostly to France and Spain. We have two adult children (Paul and Kristen).








Joanne Ramsay














Charlie Nettle


I have been a trustee of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind since January 2011. I have had limited personal experience of mental health issues but have always felt that mental health and well-being were insufficiently recognised or supported. I am therefore keen to support the worthwhile work of Mind.
I have worked in senior marketing roles since 2000. I am a member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing and achieved Chartered Marketer status in July 2011.
Since coming to the North East in 2002 and meeting my wife, I now class myself as an honorary Northerner. I enjoy spending time with my family but now and again indulge in my own hobbies including running, surfing, playing piano, guitar and drums and even a bit of plastering.














David King


I have been a trustee of Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind since November 2014 and come from a background of working in the public health and voluntary sector at a senior level.
My interest in getting involved with Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind comes from personal experience of a family suicide and the impact that had. I was therefore keen to support the work of Mind by becoming a trustee.
Being from the North-East, my interests obviously include football and in my case that involves following the fortunes of Sunderland AFC. I also enjoy horseracing and travelling.














Ruth Hicks


I've worked in the Adult Social Care sector for 15 years and worked with people suffering from severe mental illness, at very difficult times in their lives.
Throughout my professional career I was committed to working with people with mental health needs and their families in order to help them make meaningful change in their lives. For many years I was a Relate Counsellor.
Since retiring, I have worked with Charitable Trusts and Community Interest Companies such as Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind as a volunteer Trustee and/or Director.
I am also a committed member of the Anglican Church, and take my Christian faith very seriously. 
I've been married for 52 years, have four adult married sons, and seven grandchildren. My hobbies include gardening, reading, studying classical literature and social history and spending time in the countryside when time allows. Challenging trips abroad get fitted in as well!














Angela Halloway


I wanted to be a trustee for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind because as a local GP with over twenty years experience, I have a particular interest in mental health.
I was very aware that there are so many people who suffer with mental health problems. Their needs are not always met and the voluntary sector makes an important contribution to helping and supporting them in a variety of different ways. I am always impressed with the positive, creative and enthusiastic approach of the staff here at Mind.
I have two grown up sons and enjoy keeping fit by running and going for walks with my husband and our dog. I also like to garden and to travel.














Sue Cash


I joined the Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind trading company in October 2010, and then the board of trustees of the Charity in October 2011.
My interest in mental health stems from some personal experience of how the tragedy of suicide affects family and friends. From working in the NHS for most of my career, I know how poor mental health and mental illness affects so many people and has an impact on so many aspects of their lives.
I like being out on my bike, walking the dog and gardening despite keeping hens. I enjoy dressmaking, free machine sewing and textiles, and cryptic crosswords. Recently I have started and really enjoy painting in water colours.














Angie Papprill


I was delighted to have been invited to join as a trustee of Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind in 2016.
I am a qualified solicitor practicing dispute resolution at a local law firm. I grew up locally and returned to the area after university.
Mental Health awareness and support is so important and organisations like Mind are vital. I hope to be able to contribute to Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind so they are able to continue to provide these essential services for the benefit of the local community.














Jenny Morris


I joined the board of trustees as a member in 2016.
I have personal experiences of the way in which mental health problems can impact on the lives of the people with the difficulties and the wider network of people around them. I feel Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind is consistently operating for the service users and the community adapting to meet the increasing and varied needs of the people it serves. I am very privileged to be able to contribute to supporting such a worthwhile charity.
I am currently training a personal assistance dog and renovating a house, but in my spare time I enjoy board games, archery and sewing crafts.

Trustees








Trustees











Geoff Baines


I was born in Middlesbrough in 1959 and lived in Nunthorpe for 23 years until recently moving to Hartburn. 
I joined the charity's subsidiary trading company as a Director in October 2010, and was appointed Chair of the Board of Trustees/Directors of the charity in December 2011. My interest in mental health has been long standing, largely because of the history of depression in my family and also I have witnessed the massive growth of mental distress in the workplace in the last 20 years, temporarily offering myself. 
I have worked as a Human Resources professional since 1986, and I am a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development. 
My interests include watching the Boro, sports, current affairs, chess, music, writing, gardening, reading and dog walking!














Marian Ramsey


I was born and brought up in Middlesbrough. My interest in mental health is routed in my personal experience in my adolescence.
I trained as a Probation Officer and worked as a probation officer for about 15 years, until I retired from this work in 2007. Since then I’ve worked as an independent Social Worker with an interest in safeguarding, adoption and mental health. Working in women’s prisons, supporting women with mental health difficulties, really increased my interest in empowering vulnerable women with enduring mental health problems and resettlement of women from prisons and hospitals into the community.
I have been a trustee for over 7 years. It’s a really committed team, including trustees, staff and volunteers, and it’s a privilege to be associated with and able to contribute to the Charity.








John Harrison


Becoming a Trustee of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind was an opportunity to be involved in something a little different, to try to use my knowledge and experience for the benefit of others and thereby ‘give something back’.
To date I am fortunate enough to have very little personal experience of mental health problems and at the time of joining had little knowledge of the implications of mental health issues and the impact they have. I am now aware how wide ranging these problems are and of the value of providing support to those directly and indirectly affected.
During my time as Trustee I have seen Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind grow significantly to become a large and well respected organisation and it is satisfying to be associated with it and to witness the fantastic support the staff and volunteers provide to the local community.
Apart from my three years at University, I have lived in Redcar all my life and have been a Boro season ticket holder for most of that time. I also enjoy most other sports and travelling with my wife Chris mostly to France and Spain. We have two adult children (Paul and Kristen).








Joanne Ramsay














Charlie Nettle


I have been a trustee of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind since January 2011. I have had limited personal experience of mental health issues but have always felt that mental health and well-being were insufficiently recognised or supported. I am therefore keen to support the worthwhile work of Mind.
I have worked in senior marketing roles since 2000. I am a member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing and achieved Chartered Marketer status in July 2011.
Since coming to the North East in 2002 and meeting my wife, I now class myself as an honorary Northerner. I enjoy spending time with my family but now and again indulge in my own hobbies including running, surfing, playing piano, guitar and drums and even a bit of plastering.














David King


I have been a trustee of Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind since November 2014 and come from a background of working in the public health and voluntary sector at a senior level.
My interest in getting involved with Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind comes from personal experience of a family suicide and the impact that had. I was therefore keen to support the work of Mind by becoming a trustee.
Being from the North-East, my interests obviously include football and in my case that involves following the fortunes of Sunderland AFC. I also enjoy horseracing and travelling.














Ruth Hicks


I've worked in the Adult Social Care sector for 15 years and worked with people suffering from severe mental illness, at very difficult times in their lives.
Throughout my professional career I was committed to working with people with mental health needs and their families in order to help them make meaningful change in their lives. For many years I was a Relate Counsellor.
Since retiring, I have worked with Charitable Trusts and Community Interest Companies such as Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind as a volunteer Trustee and/or Director.
I am also a committed member of the Anglican Church, and take my Christian faith very seriously. 
I've been married for 52 years, have four adult married sons, and seven grandchildren. My hobbies include gardening, reading, studying classical literature and social history and spending time in the countryside when time allows. Challenging trips abroad get fitted in as well!














Angela Halloway


I wanted to be a trustee for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind because as a local GP with over twenty years experience, I have a particular interest in mental health.
I was very aware that there are so many people who suffer with mental health problems. Their needs are not always met and the voluntary sector makes an important contribution to helping and supporting them in a variety of different ways. I am always impressed with the positive, creative and enthusiastic approach of the staff here at Mind.
I have two grown up sons and enjoy keeping fit by running and going for walks with my husband and our dog. I also like to garden and to travel.














Sue Cash


I joined the Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind trading company in October 2010, and then the board of trustees of the Charity in October 2011.
My interest in mental health stems from some personal experience of how the tragedy of suicide affects family and friends. From working in the NHS for most of my career, I know how poor mental health and mental illness affects so many people and has an impact on so many aspects of their lives.
I like being out on my bike, walking the dog and gardening despite keeping hens. I enjoy dressmaking, free machine sewing and textiles, and cryptic crosswords. Recently I have started and really enjoy painting in water colours.














Angie Papprill


I was delighted to have been invited to join as a trustee of Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind in 2016.
I am a qualified solicitor practicing dispute resolution at a local law firm. I grew up locally and returned to the area after university.
Mental Health awareness and support is so important and organisations like Mind are vital. I hope to be able to contribute to Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind so they are able to continue to provide these essential services for the benefit of the local community.














Jenny Morris


I joined the board of trustees as a member in 2016.
I have personal experiences of the way in which mental health problems can impact on the lives of the people with the difficulties and the wider network of people around them. I feel Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind is consistently operating for the service users and the community adapting to meet the increasing and varied needs of the people it serves. I am very privileged to be able to contribute to supporting such a worthwhile charity.
I am currently training a personal assistance dog and renovating a house, but in my spare time I enjoy board games, archery and sewing crafts.

Trustees











Geoff Baines


I was born in Middlesbrough in 1959 and lived in Nunthorpe for 23 years until recently moving to Hartburn. 
I joined the charity's subsidiary trading company as a Director in October 2010, and was appointed Chair of the Board of Trustees/Directors of the charity in December 2011. My interest in mental health has been long standing, largely because of the history of depression in my family and also I have witnessed the massive growth of mental distress in the workplace in the last 20 years, temporarily offering myself. 
I have worked as a Human Resources professional since 1986, and I am a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development. 
My interests include watching the Boro, sports, current affairs, chess, music, writing, gardening, reading and dog walking!














Marian Ramsey


I was born and brought up in Middlesbrough. My interest in mental health is routed in my personal experience in my adolescence.
I trained as a Probation Officer and worked as a probation officer for about 15 years, until I retired from this work in 2007. Since then I’ve worked as an independent Social Worker with an interest in safeguarding, adoption and mental health. Working in women’s prisons, supporting women with mental health difficulties, really increased my interest in empowering vulnerable women with enduring mental health problems and resettlement of women from prisons and hospitals into the community.
I have been a trustee for over 7 years. It’s a really committed team, including trustees, staff and volunteers, and it’s a privilege to be associated with and able to contribute to the Charity.








John Harrison


Becoming a Trustee of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind was an opportunity to be involved in something a little different, to try to use my knowledge and experience for the benefit of others and thereby ‘give something back’.
To date I am fortunate enough to have very little personal experience of mental health problems and at the time of joining had little knowledge of the implications of mental health issues and the impact they have. I am now aware how wide ranging these problems are and of the value of providing support to those directly and indirectly affected.
During my time as Trustee I have seen Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind grow significantly to become a large and well respected organisation and it is satisfying to be associated with it and to witness the fantastic support the staff and volunteers provide to the local community.
Apart from my three years at University, I have lived in Redcar all my life and have been a Boro season ticket holder for most of that time. I also enjoy most other sports and travelling with my wife Chris mostly to France and Spain. We have two adult children (Paul and Kristen).








Joanne Ramsay














Charlie Nettle


I have been a trustee of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind since January 2011. I have had limited personal experience of mental health issues but have always felt that mental health and well-being were insufficiently recognised or supported. I am therefore keen to support the worthwhile work of Mind.
I have worked in senior marketing roles since 2000. I am a member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing and achieved Chartered Marketer status in July 2011.
Since coming to the North East in 2002 and meeting my wife, I now class myself as an honorary Northerner. I enjoy spending time with my family but now and again indulge in my own hobbies including running, surfing, playing piano, guitar and drums and even a bit of plastering.














David King


I have been a trustee of Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind since November 2014 and come from a background of working in the public health and voluntary sector at a senior level.
My interest in getting involved with Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind comes from personal experience of a family suicide and the impact that had. I was therefore keen to support the work of Mind by becoming a trustee.
Being from the North-East, my interests obviously include football and in my case that involves following the fortunes of Sunderland AFC. I also enjoy horseracing and travelling.














Ruth Hicks


I've worked in the Adult Social Care sector for 15 years and worked with people suffering from severe mental illness, at very difficult times in their lives.
Throughout my professional career I was committed to working with people with mental health needs and their families in order to help them make meaningful change in their lives. For many years I was a Relate Counsellor.
Since retiring, I have worked with Charitable Trusts and Community Interest Companies such as Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind as a volunteer Trustee and/or Director.
I am also a committed member of the Anglican Church, and take my Christian faith very seriously. 
I've been married for 52 years, have four adult married sons, and seven grandchildren. My hobbies include gardening, reading, studying classical literature and social history and spending time in the countryside when time allows. Challenging trips abroad get fitted in as well!














Angela Halloway


I wanted to be a trustee for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind because as a local GP with over twenty years experience, I have a particular interest in mental health.
I was very aware that there are so many people who suffer with mental health problems. Their needs are not always met and the voluntary sector makes an important contribution to helping and supporting them in a variety of different ways. I am always impressed with the positive, creative and enthusiastic approach of the staff here at Mind.
I have two grown up sons and enjoy keeping fit by running and going for walks with my husband and our dog. I also like to garden and to travel.














Sue Cash


I joined the Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind trading company in October 2010, and then the board of trustees of the Charity in October 2011.
My interest in mental health stems from some personal experience of how the tragedy of suicide affects family and friends. From working in the NHS for most of my career, I know how poor mental health and mental illness affects so many people and has an impact on so many aspects of their lives.
I like being out on my bike, walking the dog and gardening despite keeping hens. I enjoy dressmaking, free machine sewing and textiles, and cryptic crosswords. Recently I have started and really enjoy painting in water colours.














Angie Papprill


I was delighted to have been invited to join as a trustee of Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind in 2016.
I am a qualified solicitor practicing dispute resolution at a local law firm. I grew up locally and returned to the area after university.
Mental Health awareness and support is so important and organisations like Mind are vital. I hope to be able to contribute to Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind so they are able to continue to provide these essential services for the benefit of the local community.














Jenny Morris


I joined the board of trustees as a member in 2016.
I have personal experiences of the way in which mental health problems can impact on the lives of the people with the difficulties and the wider network of people around them. I feel Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind is consistently operating for the service users and the community adapting to meet the increasing and varied needs of the people it serves. I am very privileged to be able to contribute to supporting such a worthwhile charity.
I am currently training a personal assistance dog and renovating a house, but in my spare time I enjoy board games, archery and sewing crafts.

I have been a trustee for over 7 years. It’s a really committed team, including trustees, staff and volunteers, and it’s a privilege to be associated with and able to contribute to the Charity.








John Harrison


Becoming a Trustee of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind was an opportunity to be involved in something a little different, to try to use my knowledge and experience for the benefit of others and thereby ‘give something back’.
To date I am fortunate enough to have very little personal experience of mental health problems and at the time of joining had little knowledge of the implications of mental health issues and the impact they have. I am now aware how wide ranging these problems are and of the value of providing support to those directly and indirectly affected.
During my time as Trustee I have seen Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind grow significantly to become a large and well respected organisation and it is satisfying to be associated with it and to witness the fantastic support the staff and volunteers provide to the local community.
Apart from my three years at University, I have lived in Redcar all my life and have been a Boro season ticket holder for most of that time. I also enjoy most other sports and travelling with my wife Chris mostly to France and Spain. We have two adult children (Paul and Kristen).








Joanne Ramsay














Charlie Nettle


I have been a trustee of Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind since January 2011. I have had limited personal experience of mental health issues but have always felt that mental health and well-being were insufficiently recognised or supported. I am therefore keen to support the worthwhile work of Mind.
I have worked in senior marketing roles since 2000. I am a member of the Chartered Institute of Marketing and achieved Chartered Marketer status in July 2011.
Since coming to the North East in 2002 and meeting my wife, I now class myself as an honorary Northerner. I enjoy spending time with my family but now and again indulge in my own hobbies including running, surfing, playing piano, guitar and drums and even a bit of plastering.














David King


I have been a trustee of Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind since November 2014 and come from a background of working in the public health and voluntary sector at a senior level.
My interest in getting involved with Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind comes from personal experience of a family suicide and the impact that had. I was therefore keen to support the work of Mind by becoming a trustee.
Being from the North-East, my interests obviously include football and in my case that involves following the fortunes of Sunderland AFC. I also enjoy horseracing and travelling.














Ruth Hicks


I've worked in the Adult Social Care sector for 15 years and worked with people suffering from severe mental illness, at very difficult times in their lives.
Throughout my professional career I was committed to working with people with mental health needs and their families in order to help them make meaningful change in their lives. For many years I was a Relate Counsellor.
Since retiring, I have worked with Charitable Trusts and Community Interest Companies such as Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind as a volunteer Trustee and/or Director.
I am also a committed member of the Anglican Church, and take my Christian faith very seriously. 
I've been married for 52 years, have four adult married sons, and seven grandchildren. My hobbies include gardening, reading, studying classical literature and social history and spending time in the countryside when time allows. Challenging trips abroad get fitted in as well!














Angela Halloway


I wanted to be a trustee for Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind because as a local GP with over twenty years experience, I have a particular interest in mental health.
I was very aware that there are so many people who suffer with mental health problems. Their needs are not always met and the voluntary sector makes an important contribution to helping and supporting them in a variety of different ways. I am always impressed with the positive, creative and enthusiastic approach of the staff here at Mind.
I have two grown up sons and enjoy keeping fit by running and going for walks with my husband and our dog. I also like to garden and to travel.














Sue Cash


I joined the Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind trading company in October 2010, and then the board of trustees of the Charity in October 2011.
My interest in mental health stems from some personal experience of how the tragedy of suicide affects family and friends. From working in the NHS for most of my career, I know how poor mental health and mental illness affects so many people and has an impact on so many aspects of their lives.
I like being out on my bike, walking the dog and gardening despite keeping hens. I enjoy dressmaking, free machine sewing and textiles, and cryptic crosswords. Recently I have started and really enjoy painting in water colours.














Angie Papprill


I was delighted to have been invited to join as a trustee of Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind in 2016.
I am a qualified solicitor practicing dispute resolution at a local law firm. I grew up locally and returned to the area after university.
Mental Health awareness and support is so important and organisations like Mind are vital. I hope to be able to contribute to Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind so they are able to continue to provide these essential services for the benefit of the local community.














Jenny Morris


I joined the board of trustees as a member in 2016.
I have personal experiences of the way in which mental health problems can impact on the lives of the people with the difficulties and the wider network of people around them. I feel Middlesbrough and Stockton Mind is consistently operating for the service users and the community adapting to meet the increasing and varied needs of the people it serves. I am very privileged to be able to contribute to supporting such a worthwhile charity.
I am currently training a personal assistance dog and renovating a house, but in my spare time I enjoy board games, archery and sewing crafts.

Trustees











Geoff Baines


I was born in Middlesbrough in 1959 and lived in Nunthorpe for 23 years until recently moving to Hartburn. 
I joined the charity's subsidiary trading company as a Director in October 2010, and was appointed Chair of the Board of Trustees/Directors of the charity in December 2011. My interest in mental health has been long standing, largely because of the history of depression in my family and also I have witnessed the massive growth of mental distress in the workplace in the last 20 years, temporarily offering myself. 
I have worked as a Human Resources professional since 1986, and I am a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development. 
My interests include watching the Boro, sports, current affairs, chess, music, writing, gardening, reading and dog walking!














Marian Ramsey


I was born and brought up in Middlesbrough. My interest in mental health is routed in my personal experience in my adolescence.
I trained as a Probation Officer and worked as a probation officer for about 15 years, until I retired from this work in 2007. Since then I’ve worked as an independent Social Worker with an interest in safeguarding, adoption and mental health. Working in women’s prisons, supporting women with mental health difficulties, really increased my interest in empowering vulnerable women with enduring mental health problems and resettlement of women from prisons and hospitals into the community.
I have been a trustee for over 7 years. It’s a really committed team, including trustees, staff and volunteers, and it’s a privilege to be associated with and able to contribute to the Charity.
