“1NE is one of the best, if not the best, treatment programme in the country” Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith MP


Does any of this sound familiar? 
Are Drugs ruining your life?
Is Alcohol  controlling your life?
Are you sick of feeling sick?
Do you have bills left unopened?
Has the quality of your life deteriorated?
Are your relationships with your family strained or breaking down?
Are you having problems at work or have you lost your job?
Do your problems seem insurmountable?
Do you find it hard saying no to one more drink or drug?




Is alcohol controlling your life?
Are drugs ruining your life?
Are you sick of feeling sick?
Do you have bills unopened?
Do your problems seem insurmountable? 
Are your relationships with family breaking down?
Are you having problems at work?
Is your quality of life affected





One North East London (1NE) provides an abstinence based treatment programme for addicts wishing to maintain a sober lifestyle. We offer the only purely abstinence based treatment in the Woodbridge, Redbridge, Waltham Forest and Epping area and have clients from all over north east London.
We offer freedom through abstinence and freedom to achieve long term happiness.
1NE is aware of the devastation that addiction causes within a family (it is referred to as “the family illness”).

Day Programme


1NE offers a full time day programme consisting of group therapy based on abstinence, education and support.  Clients with drink/drug problems are required to attend full time for two weeks as an initial assessment period, after which we negotiate an individual programme.  The majority of clients continue attending for another six weeks and then begin to cut down the days they come to the Centre as their recovery strengthens.
The minimum age for the day programme is 18. We have no maximum age but the clients have to be able to travel to and from the centre on a daily basis and be able to attend all groups.
The service is suitable for people who are 24 hours or more away from their last drink of alcohol or drug.
Opening times:
Monday – Friday 9.00am – 4.30pm.
Evening Groups – Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 6.30pm  – 8.00pm
Not suitable for:



Clients with severe mental illness (details on request)
Clients unable or not prepared to be 24 hours dry (after detox)
Denial of any problem with alcohol and absence of any desire to look at the underlying issues associated with their addiction
Anyone with a history of chronic (multiple) relapse
Anyone convicted of arson
Anyone convicted of child abuse
Those individuals with a history of violence while NOT under the influence of alcohol
Family or close friends of existing clients or staff



The above exclusion clauses are guidelines only. Each client is assessed on his/her own needs.









Thank You Our services are funded by grants, charitable and personal donations. We thank you for all your generous donations to date which enable us to continue.

Testimonials


To all the 1NE Angels!
Just to say a HUGE THANK YOU!
 For helping me reach 10 years sobriety!
 Particularly for the past 18 months where you have gone over and above to help me.
 Thank you for your kindness, generosity, love and support.
 You’re all very special!
 Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
Anonymous

I am grateful for the mere fact that I exist, I have hands, fingers, feet and toes, sound knees, I do not walk with any impediment, and I do not need a wheel chair for me to get around. I can see, listen, think, taste and smell. I can breath, swim, jump for joy, cry when tears take me. And today I can be aware of all of this because I do not pick up a drink.
Bev

A year ago I walked into 1NE with a black cloud over me which had been with me for many years. I am pleased to say that with the help and understanding of the counsellors and the many friends that I have made, the cloud is beginning to become lighter. I know that I have a long way to go, but with the help of 1NE I will get there. Sobriety is something to be grateful for and that I truly am, I am beginning to enjoy life and my family for the first time in years. I now have a wonderful grandson and if it wasn’t for the help and understanding that I have had to become sober, I would not have been able to treasure all these wonderful moments with him. To live is a joy which was something I did not want. I will always be indebted to everybody at 1NE.
Susan

A Year Into Sobriety
Me again!! Our lovely Del Boy (Gerry) asked me if I would like to write a piece for this amazing newsletter for 1ne. Of course, I said yes – it’s a privilege – a year ago I could not have put pen to paper, I couldn’t stop my brain – going 100 mph!
WOW – 5th March came around and I was totally thrown. I’d got to one year and what a year it’s been. I forgot so quickly so to give this year putting pen to paper is truly mind blowing – so thank you Del Boy (Gerry).
When I came back t 1ne, I was truly broken being full of shame and guilt. I’d done a “cold turkey” (stopped all drugs) and I have to say it was horrific – 2 weeks of hell – dancing with the devil. After the physical withdrawals, my head was mental. As soon as I was able to go out, I was at the doors and 1ne.
My confusion came from wondering “how had this happened?” – I’d been clean (so I thought) for a few years but I’d got addicted to painkillers etc and it was downhill from there – hospitals, mental institutions, seizures, coma – and yet still used! 21/2 years of madness, insanity, putting my family through hell, losing friends, losing myself.
Thank God my husband made that call to 1ne because I was totally lost. I didn’t know who to turn to or go to at that time. I shook from head to toe – my mind was mashed.
I prayed for the wanting to want to live. I truly was broken but there was a light. I could just barely see and feel, that light we hope and that hope came in 1ne.
I thank God daily for 1ne and the amazing staff. They gave me courage to get myself back into living life not surviving. The staff have played a major part in my recovery. I class every one of them as a recovery tool in my life bag.
Fiona – your love, caring and hugs when I came back – I wasn’t loving me so to get a smile and a loving hug (honestly given) Got me in that door. Your dedication, understanding and time given is mind blowing. You truly are an amazing lady – a woman of courage – thank you.
Jo – Your warmth, love, knowledge, and understanding of this disease, your caring attitude and “approachability” gave me hope. I thank you.
Anita – your love for recovery and mindfulness – your frankness and knowledge, warmth and openness, honest – “this is life or death”, you’re no messing about policy! “This shit kills!” – I thank you.
Tom – our silver fox¬! I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your patience, your knowledge, openness, heartfelt compassion, honesty for re- instilling my faith. You listen and I thank you.
Vaughn – your insight! How you plug in and get us to open up and dig deep to see ourselves. Your compassion and sensitivity around painful past experiences – I thank you.
Our Jane – (“no pain no gain”) beautiful smile, big heart, your “approachability”, your compassion and ability to go where we don’t want to go to dig deep and when we do you’re there – I thank you.
Rev Ray – your insight and knowledge, your “TLC” approach, your wisdom and acknowledgement – I thank you.
Marlene – compassionate, sensitivity around painful experiences and her insight and wisdom – I thank you for that
And I thank all the clients who have come in and out of 1ne. They have played a major part in my recovery! Being in 1ne on an abstinence programme. We have together gone through some painful heart wrenching disturbing upsetting stuff! Thought feelings, life episodes – past and present. This stuff has been a lot to do with the feeding of our disease.
Together through abstinence and having staff who know what they’re talking about. We have felt each other’s pain, got the acknowledgement and understanding we have craved. We’ve gained strength, got stronger and have grown together!
Not only have I learned about this disease, I hagve learned new skills to live it with. I’m learning to do life and to feel part of. To be counted, to feel worth – a place in society.
I am truly grateful to 1neto all who have been around in my past year. 1 ne will always hae a place in my heart. A year ago, my heart was load with dark nasty stuff. My belief system which I carried around from childhood and past events fed by “stinking thinking”. What took me to dark places in my heard, my heart started emptying which then gave room to fill with compassion, love, choices, happiness, laughter, fun courage etc etc.
Today I’m still around 1ne. I do aftercare in the week, a group on Saturday mornings. I live a 12 step programme, I do to 3-5 meetings – which is a couples of hours out of my day.
What has recovery given me:
Apart from life, today I’ve got everything I need. Not what I want. What I want never gets me well – mentally or physically.
But getting what I need – Recovery – gets and keeps me well. Gives me peace of mind, instills hope, lets me live life – not just survive it.
And in Recovery, 1NE, AA, CA, NA, OA, 12 step programme, helping others, being of use, being in the circle of life – not on the outside looking in!

Today, God has me
My husband has his wife
My kids have a “present” mum
My grandchildren have a nan
My friends have a friend
Wow – miracles do happen

Sometimes we are just to clouded to see them and too numb to feel them. But not today

Today that light shines bright
Some days brighter than others!
Thank God for 1NE, 12 Step fellowships
Recovery for life

Fiona

Friends of 1NE


We know that weekends can be hard for people. So Friends of 1NE, set up by a client in 1998, organises social events and additional weekend support. Our quiz nights have become hugely popular, with up to 40 current and ex service users getting together.
Regular Friday night meditation and Saturday workshops are attended by up to 20 people. Our meditation days are very laid back, with a sociable lunch. At the end of the day, we’ll chat about anything that may have come up during the three meditations.
Friends of 1NE raises funds to help the service as well as social events for clients and their families.

Relatives Service


Addiction is a family condition which stresses the family to breaking point. It can impact the stability of the home, family unity, mental and physical health and overall family dynamics.
1NE offers a counselling service for anybody affected by somebody elses’ addiction. We offer individual and group therapy.
Experience shows that if family members engage in therapy and establish boundaries to enable them to detach from the addictive behaviour and focus on looking after themselves, the whole family will benefit.
Addiction is sometimes called a ‘family illness’, because the ripples of addiction affect so many people. It often passes down from generation to generation. With our relatives service programme we believe it is incredibly important to work with the adult children of addicts, to prevent patterns of addiction through successive generations. We look at issues of co-dependency and help families to understand that with addiction: they did not cause it, cannot control it and cannot cure it.
If you are affected by someone’s drinking or drug taking you can contact the Relatives Service on 020 8504 9174.

Our clients come from all areas of London and the South East, and all walks of life, to join our community.
Jacqui’s story

“For the first six weeks I came here, I didn’t talk. I was cut off from the world completely. I didn’t feel worth anything, or worthy or help. But the people here care, and I’ve now been coming for over two and a half years. They are compassionate and genuine, and 1NE has become like a family.
“I learnt here that everyone is worthwhile, just some have lost their way. I didn’t want to live when I first arrived, but through 1NE I had the opportunity to want to live again. Everyone helps everyone else, and with counselling and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy I learnt coping mechanisms for the future. It’s not all doom and gloom, and if you relapse you are welcomed back with open arms.
“1NE is helping my children too, the future generation. People think children are resilient, but every addict was someone’s child. Without this place, I wouldn’t be on the planet and I don’t know where my children would be.”
Gary’s story
“I’m an alcoholic, but haven’t had a drink for ten years, thanks to 1NE. I was in hospital on a life-support machine after my last drink. I worked as a publican, and would booze all day long. What started as a social drink with customers progressed to not wanting people to leave at closing time. In 2000, I lost my business and my house, my wife and my dog. I was made bankrupt, with nowhere to live, and had a suitcase with all my belongings: five shirts and two pairs of trousers. Alcohol is the great remover – it strips you of everything.
I was starting to have seizures, and woke up in hospital a couple of times, but I’d always justify it – wet leaves, tripping on the pavement, it was always somebody or someone else’s fault. I came to 1NE in 2005. The downside to recovery is there is no one else to blame.
From the moment I walked in I had a sense of belonging. I felt comfortable and supported as I was speaking to other people who understood what I was going through at that time. I was given the tools to maintain my sobriety, and I found that in group therapy I started looking at the similarities between me and others, rather than the differences. I began to see I had value, and wasn’t a pointless waste of space. Once I accepted the disease model of alcoholism, and could see it wasn’t a weakness, my recovery started. If it wasn’t for 1NE I’d probably be dead by now. Instead, I have a sense of purpose and sense of achievement. And I got my sense of humour back.

1NE Teens


1NE Teens offer free individual counselling to young people, aged between 12 and 21, whose parents or carers have an alcohol or addiction problem.
We provide a safe environment for you to share your fears and difficulties, and will help with your self-esteem, confidence, and goal setting. We will help you increase your awareness of addiction and learn new coping skills for living with an addict. We provide counselling in local schools in Redbridge and Waltham Forest and at our offices, for young people living with addiction.
The Lead Learning Mentor at one of the schools said:
“The fact that the students have had this support has been beneficial to their ability to learn. Without this support I do not believe that many of these students would have made the progress that they have. No one can perform miracles and as we all know the opportunity for students to be able to express their feelings and emotions in a safe a structured environment can only benefit their focus on learning.”

Success Rate


‘Just for today – one day at a time’ 
Our multi award-winning service offers one of the very few true community based abstinence treatment programmes. We offer an unrivalled success rate, while avoiding the high costs of residential care.
We believe addiction is an illness. We help you address any feelings of shame associated with addiction so you are able to heal.
Our results speak for themselves:
1NE clients experience a 70 per cent success rate in remaining sober and drug free one year after completing treatment.
Whilst it is difficult to obtain accurate success rates for moderation management therapies, we know that 30 per cent of users go on to try an abstinence-based program.
After one year, with methadone-based treatments not supported by 1NE, 50 per cent of people have relapsed.
Why it works:
We offer a compassionate service. We understand addiction: most of us have experienced addiction ourselves or within our families. It’s not like a broken arm – it isn’t going to just mend itself.
You may feel like the only person who has become an addict, but the 1NE family will help you address your problems and feel less cut off from the world.
We are Alcoholics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous friendly, and find that many people who we see will also go on to become part of these support groups. We see ourselves as a stepping stone in your network of recovery.
Our therapy and counselling is aligned with the 12 Steps programme, based on the belief that once you have a drink or drug in you, you are powerless. We believe addiction is a lifelong illness.

Family Forum


1NE Family Forum is a support group for the families of people affected by someone else’s addiction.
We are relatives of addicts, who have come together to share and support each other in our recovery from the effects of someone else’s addiction. We offer a safe, supportive environment in which to share our experiences, to organise social occasions and to provide workshops.
Anybody who comes to the Relatives’ Service can belong to the Forum. We meet about every six weeks to plan our activities, such as eating out, walks, coach and boat trips, craft nights and workshops. We also raise money and take part in events to raise the awareness of our Relatives’ Service and 1NE…
We also hope that everybody has some fun!

Services for Individuals


Clients start our programme when they are 24 hours away from their last drink or drug.
You will have an hour of individual counselling before being offered a place at 1NE. All clients attend the programme for a minimum of two weeks of full time therapy. Here, we combine individual counselling with group sessions, where clients offer each other support, and start the day with guided relaxation. Many clients continue on the programme for some further weeks.
If you are in full time work, we may be able to offer you a tailored service of individual counselling.
There is no cut off from 1NE – our door is always open to former clients and our Friends of 1NE social events help keep our community supportive and strong. We offer after-care and evening groups, and are always open to help you.
Individual Counselling

When you first come to 1NE you will have an initial assessment with one of our trained addiction counsellors.
.

While most of the therapy takes place in groups, there is always a chance to discuss any problems, feelings, thoughts or your progress with our counsellors, who are trained in Psychodynamic, Integrative, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and Person-Centred theories.
Group Sessions
Group Therapy
Most of your programme is made up of group therapy sessions. The support of the 1NE community will help in your journey to remain alcohol or drug free.
The group sessions help you to learn ways of coping with different challenges you may be facing, including issues around feelings, loss, change and relapse prevention.
Relaxation 
“Like pressing an imaginary pause button in your head”
Relaxation sessions are a big part of the recovery process for many of our clients, who often find it difficult to switch off. We will teach you techniques to help you to find calm in any circumstances.
In the early days of recovery, many clients experience getting their feelings – which may have been numbed – back in full force. Our relaxation sessions help thoughts and emotions come to the surface, so we can acknowledge and accept them, and find a sense of calm in the world.
We start our days at 1NE with a group relaxation session, and offer meditation days and evenings through our Friends of 1NE  programme.










Thank You Our services are funded by grants, charitable and personal donations. We thank you for all your generous donations to date which enable us to continue.

Coop Funding


Buy your Shopping at the Coop and help your favourite charity!

 “The Co-op Local Community Fund is our way of giving back to our millions of members and their communities – providing funding to local causes that our members care about.”
1NE was successful in being chosen by the Co-op Local Community Fund.  This means every time our (Co-op) members buy selected Co-op branded products and services, 1% of their spend goes to a local cause. The more members spend, the more money goes 1NE if they chose us as their charity.  Money from sales of our reusable carrier bags, and the 5 pence legal charge on carrier bags will also be used to kick start the funding for each cause. So that’ll mean even more for 1NE.
To swipe a marketing slogan from another well-known supermarket, “Every Little Helps” 
Pleased pick up a membership card whilst in store or register on line at:  http://www.coop.co.uk/membership/
Here are details of The Co-op Food stores and funeral homes that will be supporting your cause.
Co-Operative Food, 111-113 Fencepiece Road, Hainault IG6 2LD
Co-Operative Food, 686 Chigwell Road, Woodford Bridge IG8 8AQ
Co-Operative Food, 1134 Horns Road, Ilford IG6 1BE
We’re hoping to raise £25,000 which means customers spending £2,500,000 !!!
