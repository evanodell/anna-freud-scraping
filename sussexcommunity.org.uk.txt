Celebrating the launch of SCDA at Denton Island 
3rd October 2014
 


SCDA celebrated the change of name from NCDA on Friday 3rd October at Denton Island Community Centre with trustees, partners, friends, member groups, staff and dignitaries. We were proud to hear from the Lord Lieutenant of East Sussex, Peter Field, Norman Baker  MP and our Patron Caroline Mayhew who were kind enough to attend and say a few words.
 
Our new name reflects our growth in projects across East Sussex and we celebrate helping and supporting more people and projects in the community.

Sharing Memories for Black History Month 2014 
11th November 2014
 

Stories of new and old, far and wide were shared during a Black History Month celebration event organised by Sompriti  at the Hillcrest Centre, Newhaven. 
Members of the community from diverse backgrounds came together to record their journeys, experiences and memories. Some of them spoke of their fears and worries of coming to a new country and others about the excitement of joining family after long periods of separation. Many of the stories are coloured with a mixture of sadness, fond recollections and reflections on how they’re lives and identities are now rooted in East Sussex.
The event captured memories and thoughts of those who arrived in the 1950’s right up to the most recent arrivals in the 2000’s. Stories were unravelled and recorded using an arts and crafts approach. Sompriti hopes to build these resources into an exhibition giving exclusive insight into the personal lives of members of our communities.

2nd February 2015
 

Great to see our Progress clients enjoy our social cinema film Mona Lisa Smile on 28th January. Ten clients attended and as well as enjoying a film they took part in a group discussion aimed to increase critical thinking. We look forward to more next month with the Julia Roberts film Erin Brockovich.

Crowds out in force for Newhaven’s Fish Festival! 
18th June 2015
 

The sun shone last Saturday 13th June for the 12th Annual Fish Festival with more people attending than ever. Over 40 community groups attended together with art and craft activities, children’s rides and live entertainment provided by the Maestro Academy Players, Haven Harmonies, EarthQuake Drumming Band,  Queen Elsa from ‘Frozen’ and local celebrity Sam Jones performing a magic and ventriloquism show. Event Organiser Sally Foote said ‘This year’s event was particularly special as more people than ever attended.  There was a real sense of community pride as the crowd gathered together to enjoy the celebration.  My thanks to Veolia Environmental Services for their continued sponsorship of the event.’

Celebrating the Year of the Monkey! 
15th February 2016
 

Sompriti marked the Chinese New Year with an event in Seaford last week. Visitors enjoyed Chinese brush painting demonstrations, Chinese tea tasting and paper crafts along with delicious food and traditional Chinese sweets. Nearly 50 people packed St Leonard’s Church Hall. A great time was had by all. ‘I loved that the event taught us about Chinese culture as well as the fantastic food…let’s do more events like this!’

Bags of Help 
28th October 2016
 

Denton Island Community Centre has the chance to revamp their Community Garden but we need your help.
Please vote for our project at the Lewes Tesco store from 31st October until 13th November 2016.
Tesco has teamed up with Groundwork on its Bags of Help initiative in hundreds of regions across England and Wales. The scheme will see three community groups and projects in each of these regions awarded grants of £12,000, £10,000 and £8,000 – all raised from the 5p bag charge.
Bags of Help offers community groups and projects in each of Tesco’s 416 regions across the UK a share of revenue generated from the 5p charge levied on single-use carrier bags. The public will now vote in store from 31st October – 13th November on who should receive the £12,000, £10,000 and £8,000 awards. In total, there is over £12.5 million up for grabs.
For more information about the scheme visit www.tesco.com/bagsofhelp

Day Care Provision at Phoenix


Home > Phoenix Centre > Day Care Provision at Phoenix 




Are you or someone you know aged over 55 and living with Dementia, Alzheimers, the effects of a stroke or a learning disability, or perhaps have similar physical and or mental health needs to some of the above?
Are you a carer, who needs a break to manage and enjoy your own time, in the knowledge that a family member, friend or client, is being looked after in a safe, secure, welcoming and stimulating environment, by a fully trained care staff team?
The Phoenix Centre is open from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday and most Bank Holidays, with the exception of Christmas and New Years’ day.
How to access the service:
There are two routes to accessing care and support at the Phoenix Centre: one option is to contact and be assessed by East Sussex County Council Adult Social Care. If you meet the assessment criteria, which includes a financial assessment and are given funding, we will be informed and will agree a start date for you.
The second option, if you feel you would benefit from the service and meet the costs yourself, is to apply to us directly either by phone, email or in person by visiting the centre. We can also visit you in your home to carry out an assessment, at a time convenient to you.
Irrespective of which route is taken to access the day care, you can take up our free taster day offer, by coming along for part or all of the day, take part in the activities and have lunch. This may help you to decide if day care is a service you feel meets your needs and you would enjoy.
Each week, there is a wide variety of activities to join in, including pottery, dance and creative writing. See Activities for more details.
Our qualified chef and her team provide a freshly cooked two course lunch every day and a selection of homemade cakes, biscuits and refreshments, which are available all day. See Meals for more details.
We provide a flexible package of services, from an hourly rate, to a half or full day’ care, all of which include refreshments and activities, provided by an experienced and trained staff team and external facilitators. See pricing schedule and meet the team for more details
For further information call Andrea or Janet on 01273 472 005, or email us at:
Andrea.Januszewska@sussexcommunity.org.uk
Janet.Cogan@sussexcommunity.org.uk
Or visit us at

Phoenix Centre, Lewes
The Phoenix Centre is based in the centre of Lewes, providing day care to people over the age of 55, who need care and support due to living with Dementia, Alzheimers, effects of a stroke or a learning disability. The service also provides support and respite to families and carers of our clients. Our aim is to provide a day care service which encourages and enables clients to take part in a range of diverse activities, from puppetry to ballroom dancing and hand massage, which facilitates both physical and mental good health, maximising independence and preventing further ill health. 
Our kitchen serves freshly cooked lunches to both our clients and those living in the locally community, as well as providing homemade snacks and cakes for small events.
We work alongside other agencies to provide an in house range of health related services, such as counselling, a smoking cessation clinic and a foot care service, all of which are accessible to our day care clients. We also have a fully operational bathing suite, which can be hired out to carers or families of clients with limited mobility. 
There are rooms for hire in The Phoenix Centre, both small and large, accommodating between 1 to 40 people. The building and rooms are ideal for meetings, music, dancing and singing practice, art and creative workshops, language classes and even children’s parties. 
For more information or an informal chat please call 01273 472005 and speak with a member of our friendly team.

FAQ’s
 

Home > Denton Island Nursery > FAQ’s 




How do I start my child at Denton Island Nursery?

Firstly call us on 01273 515125 or pop down to Denton Island Nursery to arrange a show round the nursery.
Complete the Denton Island Nursery Application Form and return it as soon as possible. Nursery Application Form
Once a space has been allocated we will arrange settles for you and your child to spend time at nursery with their new key person.

We would advise to start settles at least 4 weeks before your child is due to start at Denton Island Nursery as we like to make sure that children are properly settled with us before they start.

Each child is different and will require different levels of support when settling. Arrangements can be made for ‘stay and play’ sessions where parents stay with children for short sessions, these sessions are helpful especially if your child becomes very unsettled and upset when left. Please see our settling and transition policy for more information on settling.
What should I provide for my child?
We ask parents/carers to provide the following items for their child:-

Nappies, wipes and a nappy cream (if applicable) – please ensure you provide one more nappy than you think you’ll need just in case.
Comforter – like a dummy, cuddly toy or blanket if your child has one
Pre measured Formula or made up milks (if applicable)
A change of old clothes – labelled please, if your child is potty training please include a good number of spare knickers/pants
Wellington boots and rain coats/waterproofs – in wet weather
Sun hats and a sun cream of SPF 15 or above – if possible a water resistant sun cream and a sunhat that shades your child’s face, ears and neck is best
Warm coat, scarf and gloves – in cold weather.

How do I contact Denton Island Nursery?
You can contact the nursery on 517250 or 515125 to come through to the reception who can transfer your call to us, our admin or finance teams. If you wish to call the nursery between the hours of 5pm and 6pm then please call 515125 as the other number will go straight to answer phone, this is also the number to call to leave a message for the nursery in the morning between 6am and 8am.
What do I do if my child is unwell?
From time to time children come down with coughs, colds or feel under the weather. While for the most part children are still well enough to attend nursery sometimes it is better for them to rest in the calm and familiar environment of home.
We do require all parents/carers to keep their children at home when they are unwell and may be infectious to others and a list of the common childhood illnesses, their incubation periods and the time children must be away from nursery for is included in the Welcome Pack.
We ask that children remain home for 24 hours after starting a course of medication to give them a chance to rest in a calm environment.
If your child is unwell please let us know by calling reception on 515125.
It is important for us to know if any child attending nursery has been unwell, even if it is just from teething, so that we can monitor the child during their day and provide appropriate care.
If your child becomes unwell at nursery we will make every effort to contact you and to care for your child in accordance with our sick child policy.
Can my child attend Denton Island Nursery after having an immunisation?
We ask all parents/carers to keep their child at home for the first 12 hours after having an immunisation, which can make a child feel unwell and a bit sore and sensitive, allowing them time to rest and recuperate.
Can the nursery give my child medication?
Denton Island Nursery will not administer medications unless they are needed to manage a child’s on-going or recurrent health care need (for example Inhalers, epipens, eczema creams) and our medicines policy and related procedures have been followed.
For children requiring short term medications for immediate health care, for example, antibiotics, cough medicine, ear drops, eye drops etc, we require parents/carer to administer these medicines themselves either before or after nursery sessions. If a dose is due whilst the child is at nursery we require parents/carers to return to nursery and administer such medications themselves.
Children must remain at home for 12 hours after starting any course of medication for their own health and wellbeing.
What should I do if I’m running late to collect my child?
Sometimes traffic or an unexpected delay can make any of us late. We ask all parents/carers to try their best to contact us and let us know if they are delayed, especially if you think you will be later than our closing time of 6 pm so we can reassure your child you are on your way.
If you are running very late and have organised for a friend or relative to collect your child it is especially important you let us know so we can follow our collection of children policy.
Lateness may result in a charge to cover the cost of staff working overtime and other additional costs the nursery may incur.
In the event a child is not collected from nursery on time and we have not heard from you staff will follow the non-collection of children procedure. 
Where can I get more information?

There is a parent notice board and home learning board in the nursery hallway giving you information on nursery events and plans, local events, local schools, upcoming course you may like to access, and ideas for play and activities for you to share with your child at home. We have a variety of support information on all kinds of subjects from potty training tips, to tips on how to help your child to eat more healthily.
The wellbeing board in the hallway has information on today’s lunch and tea menus, healthy foods ideas, and information about any illnesses in the nursery or local area and a copy of the information about incubation and exclusion periods for many childhood illnesses.
Our staff team will always try to make time to greet you and give you some information on your child’s day at collection times.

How can my child get the free nursery places for 2 years olds?
There is funding available for some families for 15 free hours for 2 year old to access our nursery. To find out if you are eligible, please check out ESCC website at eastsussex.gov.uk.
How can my child get the free nursery places for 3 years olds?
In the term after your child’s 3rd birthday we will give you the form you need to complete so your child can get their free nursery entitlement. If you have any other question please ask Sarah W, Sarah C, Marilyn or Emma at reception.
What should I do when my child is about to start school?
Keep an eye-out on our Parent Notice Board in the winter and spring time as your child approaches their fourth birthday for information about local school open days, details on how the process all works, where to go to get advice, and to get ideas to support your child through the transition.

Participants will also practice Goal Setting, Motivational Interviewing, Health Chats and Making a Plan for Behaviour Change. Handouts and Toolkits will be given on how to apply skills learnt to their work practice including details of healthy lifestyle support services in East Sussex.
Behaviour Change for Health 1-day training objectives:

Understand the background to Behaviour Change for Health.
Increase knowledge of health issues related to smoking, alcohol,   healthy eating and physical activity.
Understand how Brief Advice works.
Gain the skills and confidence to initiate a Health Chat.
Increase knowledge of lifestyle support services.

Public Health England:
“Making Every Contact Count is an approach to behaviour change that utilises the millions of day-to-day interactions organisations and individuals have with other people to support them in making positive changes to their physical and mental health and wellbeing. MECC enables the opportunistic delivery of consistent and concise healthy lifestyle information and enables individuals to engage in conversations about their health at scale across organisations and populations.
For organisations MECC means providing their staff with the leadership, environment, training and information they need to deliver the MECC approach.
For staff MECC means having the competence and confidence to deliver healthy lifestyle messages, to encourage people to change their behaviour, and to direct them to local services that can support them.
For individuals MECC means seeking support and taking action to improve their own lifestyle by eating well, maintaining a healthy weight, drinking alcohol sensibly, exercising regularly, not smoking and looking after their wellbeing and mental health.”
To arrange for Jazka to talk you through the knowledge you will need and issues that arise from dealing with the public health & well-being contact 01273 516032 or email us on healthylifestyles@sussexcomunity.org.uk for dates for the training programme.

At Denton Island Nursery we value parents/carers as the child’s first and most enduring educators. To make the most of your knowledge we seek to work in partnership with you by using the experiences your child has outside nursery to enrich their learning and development within the nursery and to feed back ideas to you that will offer exciting opportunities for home learning. We aim to involve you as much as possible in the life of the nursery.

We also offer a range of learning and training opportunities open to all parents/carers at Denton Island Community Centre.
There are lots of ways that we like to involve parents/carers as equal partners in their child’s learning and development.

Complete WOW vouchers sharing your child’s achievements, interests, family news or events with us
Free access to your child’s learning journey through a secure password system, so that you can share with your child or family and friends at home.

What we offer
 

Home > Denton Island Nursery > What we offer 




Sensory room
The sensory room at Denton Island Nursery provides a calm space for all our babies and children which we use every day. It helps us to enhance learning and development opportunities and is a fabulous space to help enrich story telling. We are able to provide multi-sensory play opportunities tailored to the individual needs of each child especially those who have specific or additional needs.
Language groups
We run weekly fun language sessions for children who have communication difficulties. Some of the children are already supported by speech and language therapists however the sessions are open to all nursery children to help support all areas of communication development. In our daily letters and sounds groups, children have opportunities to practise rhythm and rhymes, letter sounds and singing, all of which help support children develop their reading and writing skills.
Forest school
We are in the process of introducing simple forest school activities into the nursery sessions. Forest school enables children to access nature and the environment and explore taking risks while being safe and supported.
Learning journeys
Every child has a learning journey which tracks their unique progress and development which enables us to plan next steps based on what children already know and what they are interested in. We use the Tapestry online secure learning journey system. We encourage parents to contribute the learning journeys by adding comments and photos of family events.
Key person
Every child has a key person who will help support both you and your child in becoming familiar with the Nursery, meet your child’s personal care needs and provide rich learning experiences tailored to meet your child’s needs. Your child’s key person will also make observations and update learning journeys. Each child also has a secondary key person who will provide care for your child if their key person is on holiday or off sick.
Food and Drink
Denton Island Nursery recognises the importance of establishing healthy eating patterns during a child’s first years of life. With this in mind at snack and meal times we aim to provide healthy, balanced and nutritious food which meets the children’s individual needs.
We use ‘Little Tums’ who provide children with a hot and nutritious lunch catering to a range of dietary requirements or parent/carers can choose to provide their child with a packed lunch.
Water is offered to drink at all times of the day. Milk is offered at breakfast and snack times along with water and can be made available to children who will not drink water.
Fruit juices, squashes, smoothies and fizzy drinks are not permitted at nursery. Please be aware we cannot re-heat any pre-prepared foods and we ask all parent/carers not to include any peanut or peanut based products in their child’s lunchboxes.

Well-being and Safety
 

Home > Well-being and Safety 




SCDA and our partner organisations run a range of services to help and support people who are at a vulnerable point in their lives or who may feel unsafe.
Safe from Harm is a service that can support you if you have been the victim of anti-social behaviour. To access our service you will need to be referred by one of our partners including Sussex Police or your local housing provider. They will ask you some questions to decide if we are the best service to support you.
The service also supports individuals who have experienced a hate incident or a hate crime. This is when you feel you have been targeted because of your ethnicity, faith, disability status, sexuality, gender or gender identity. You can download our leaflet here Safe from Harm.
Top tips for keeping safe

Call 999 if you are in immediate danger
Report other incidents using the 101 Sussex Police phone number
Take your personal alarm when you leave your home
Think about varying your routines and having someone keep you company
Keep diary sheets and record anything that is happening

If you are in immediate danger call 999.

Community Development Hailsham
 

Home > Community Development Hailsham 




We support local residents to develop their neighbourhoods, improve facilities and build community resilience in Hailsham and surrounding areas. We do this by aiming to understand need, identify existing community resources, create relationships and help to facilitate development.
East Sussex Good Neighbour Scheme 

This pilot project aims to increase the range of informal support networks available to frail elderly and disabled people, through promoting active citizenship and volunteer participation in local community befriending.
Our befriending service in Hailsham, Herstmonceux and Polegate aims to support and benefit older people and those with disabilities. We offer long term support to local residents (over 18) who suffer from loneliness, isolation or a disability. The service provides regular home visits to befriend and support. This may be a cup of tea and a chat, support in finding social groups or luncheon clubs, transport to and from appointments, or help with other simple tasks.
Please note – while the pilot project has now come to an end and we seek further funding, the project will be run with reduced resources, supported by staff based at Prospects House. These reduced resources will be focused on supporting existing volunteers and clients but we will be unable to accept new referrals at this time.

Denton Island Nursery
 

Home > Denton Island Nursery 




We recently celebrated our 12 year anniversary and are proud to have a reputation for affordable high quality child care for children from 3 months old to 5 year olds. Our experienced team of staff, many of whom have worked at Denton Island Nursery for 10 years or more, are DBS checked and hold paediatric first aid training.
We are open 50 weeks of the year between 8am – 6pm with a range of start and collection times to coincide with finishing times of all local schools to help meet the needs of busy parents.

Denton Island Nursery is set in a tranquil island setting close to the town centre with its own ample parking. We have a lovely large rear garden with willow den, flower beds, sand pit, bike track, children’s planting area plus shaded decked area which the babies and children enjoy every day.
Ofsted 
We are proud that our most recent Ofsted report in May 2013 rated our overall quality of nursery provision as ‘outstanding’ and noted, among other things, that ‘ progress in all areas of children’s development is excellent’ and ‘staff create a warm, caring and supportive environment’. The full report is displayed in the nursery hallway and you are very welcome to request a copy.
We are committed to supporting every child to become confident, capable and to independently access all that our nursery provision has to offer, in preparation for becoming lifelong learners and towards achieving their full potential.
Denton Island Nursery Vision

Every child in our nursery has the right to:
Be themselves and be valued for who they are;
Be treated with respect and listened to;
Feel welcome and be safe, protected and cared for;
Make friends and be happy;
Learn how to make healthy choices and become independent;
Have adults who will give them encouragement, support and time to explore and learn through play;
Have fun discovering their world and getting messy;
Be stimulated to learn new skills and knowledge;
Feel secure to take risks and try out new challenges.

Our Nursery welcome letter gives more information to our parents/carers.
The local offer is the new term to describe the services available to children with SEND (special educational needs and disabilities). Our offer will give parents information about the services and support we can offer to children with SEND at our nursery and further information is available to download here Denton Island Nursery SEN and disability local offer.
For more specific information about other services please refer to the East Sussex County Council website.
 A useful link to Children’s Centres is here. They provide a range of services and activities to support the needs of families.

Newhaven Food Bank is now based at Denton Island Community Centre, Denton Island, Newhaven.

How to use the Food Bank:
Please go to the reception desk at Denton Island Community Centre with a copy of a referral form issued to you by the agency referring you (for example, Job Centre Plus, Social Services, Homeworks and so on). A member of staff at reception will call the Food Bank and a volunteer will take you there and give you the food parcel. Your referral form entitles you to a maximum of six food parcels. If you need further assistance our Food Bank team can review this with the referring agency and continued support is possible once a new referral form is issued to you. The Food Bank is open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursday mornings from 9am to 12pm. It will also be open from 10am-12pm each Friday from the beginning of February 2017.
Donations of non-perishable food are very welcome and can be left at several collection points including Sainsbury’s Newhaven, Newhaven Town Council Offices, Denton Island Community Centre and the Sacred Heart Church.
Volunteers are welcome – please contact the Healthy Living team on 01273 516032.

Home > Care & Support > Home cooked meals 




The menu for our day care changes weekly and we aim to use seasonal produce as much as possible.

We are passionate about providing healthy meals, there is always a second option on the menu, which if the main option is meat, will usually be vegetarian. All meals will be served with a generous helping of at least two seasonal vegetables. We of course cater for diabetics, vegans and anyone with gluten intolerance and any food allergies.
Our chefs are wonderful with pastry and desserts and there will also be generously portioned and healthy fresh fruit salads on offer too.

During the day clients are offered and can request unlimited hot and cold drinks, small snacks, biscuits and fresh fruit.
The cafes are open to the public and anyone can book a table for lunch, receiving a two course meal, with tea or coffee, for just £6.
At the Phoenix Centre and Charter Centre we are able to provide hot or cold buffets for any customers hiring our rooms – see room hire for more details.
Contact us now or pop in and have a chat with one of our friendly team!

We are proud that our day centres receive such good reviews on www.carehome.co.uk, some of which are below. Please check out our latest reviews here: https://www.carehome.co.uk/day_care_centre.cfm/id/65432215651#reviews and why not come and visit too? Taster Days are free!
Review: My husband suffers from Alzheimer’s and for him to use the Phoenix Centre five days a week is a great relief to me. As you will see in the boxes I have ticked below, I would recommend the Phoenix Centre to anybody who needs a few hours of me time! The staff and transport team are all so kind and supportive of my husband’s needs, I can’t fault them. I say a big thank you to all of them.

Review: Before Dad attended the centre, he was asked would he like to go and see if he liked it? This was really beneficial. He enjoys all the activities especially the music but he doesn’t always take part due to bad health but is never made to feel awkward. The food is of a good standard. The centre always makes good contact to advise me of anything I need to know. Dad really enjoys the days he attends.

Counselling
 

Home > Well-being and Safety > Counselling 




We provide safe and confidential counselling to people who are struggling with different issues, including support for survivors of suicide and those affected by sexual abuse. Counselling provides the opportunity to speak confidentially to an independent and non-judgemental person who will listen and work with you to improve your situation.
A counsellor will not tell you what to do but will help you gain a fuller understanding of the things that are on your mind, enabling you to identify options or alternative ways of looking at these issues. Our Accessibility Statement can be downloaded here Accessibility Statement
Sussex Community Counselling 
We offer counselling for anyone aged 16 years and above. We offer an initial introductory session where you can ask questions and tell us a bit about why you want to come for counselling. A self referral form can be downloaded here Self-referral form 2015
Sussex Community Counselling – a BACP accredited service
Our counselling service has just been awarded BACP Service Accreditation. This means that what we offer has been commended by the British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy as a well organised and professionally run therapeutic counselling provision. We are one of only a handful of services across Sussex to have achieved this.
In their report, the assessor said, “It is clear that Sussex Community Counselling has a range of good policies and procedures in place and that an invaluable service is being provided to the local community, all of which are to be commended.”
                                                                     
 
 
 
 
The Haven Project – for people who have been sexually abused or raped
The funding for the Haven Project has now come to an end. This means that unfortunately we are no longer able to offer this specialist service. Survivors of sexual abuse can still be seen in the low-cost service where they will work with an experienced counsellor who has additional training in this type of work.
If you have experienced rape, sexual assault, childhood sexual abuse, unwanted sexual contact or are confused about a sexual experience it may be helpful to talk about it to someone who understands.
To access the service either complete a self-referral form  Self-referral form or ring the counselling office on 01273 519108 and we will take the details over the phone. We will also arrange an appointment for an initial introductory session where you can find out more about the service and what we can offer you, and we can find out a bit more about you.
We ask for a contribution towards the cost of providing the service. This contribution will be talked about in your introductory session and will take into account your ability to pay.
 
Counselling Partnership – Support for Survivors of Suicide
Providing effective and timely support for anyone who is thinking about suicide or who is affected by suicide or attempted suicide (families and carers, friends and colleagues). This is a free service offering one to one and group support across East Sussex. As well as face to face counselling we offer telephone support where appropriate.
Support group for people bereaved by suicide is available on the 2nd Monday of the month at Matthew 25 Mission, Seaside, Eastbourne from 7pm to 8.30pm. Please just turn up or call 01273 519108 with any questions.
Are you feeling suicidal now or concerned about someone else? Please click on the following link to get help:
http://www.prevent-suicide.org.uk/find_help.html

For more information and an application form please contact the Counselling Coordinator, Sue Starnes on 01273 519108 or email sue.starnes@sussexcommunity.org.uk.
Feedback from our clients

The Gallery Community Café
 

Home > Healthy Living > The Gallery Community Café 




Welcome to the Gallery Community Café! 
Situated in the heart of Crowborough and sitting inside the modern and bright Crowborough Centre, the café opened for business in April 2016. We celebrated on 3rd October 2016 with a successful launch event – thank you to Councillor Ron Reed, Mayor of Crowborough who formally opened the cafe.
We are open from Monday to Friday from 9.30am to 3.30pm and Saturday 9.30am to 2.30pm.
Our friendly team serves the local community and various larger groups, from mothers and babies clubs, to the Women’s Institute and the local Bridge Club. There are home baked scones freshly cooked every morning and a range of snacks and hot meals each day, with a weekly changing menu. The café also caters for special events, which can be booked through the community centre management team.

All meals will be served with a generous helping of at least two seasonal vegetables. We of course cater for diabetics, vegans and anyone with gluten intolerance and any food allergies.
Our chefs are wonderful with pastry and desserts and there will also be generously portioned and healthy fresh fruit salads on offer too.
The cafes are open to the public and anyone can book a table for lunch, receiving a two course meal, with tea or coffee, for just £6.
