Welcome
1 in 4 people have some sort of mental health problem at some time in their lives. You are not alone!
This can include things like feeling stressed or worried, down or depressed, angry or overwhelmed. Sometimes these feelings can be a reaction to problems in your life like bullying or arguments at home. Sometimes the feelings can be a response to memories or problems from the past. And sometimes you just don't know why you feel the way you do.
Healthy Young Minds is here to help. This website gives you information on how to help yourself, where to go for more help and what we offer here.

I'm a young person...
Growing up isn't always easy and everyone has problems from time to time.
It's Good to Talk...
Sometimes all you need is to share how you feel with someone you can trust. Is there anyone you can talk to about how you are feeling?
Maybe:

Your parents or other relatives like Aunts, Uncles, Grandparents, close family friends?
Anyone at school – teachers, school counsellor, friends?
Anyone outside of school – sports coach, dance instructor, club leader, someone from within your faith community?

Self-help
There are also plenty of ways you can help yourself to feel better at home. Finding ways to relax and unwind such as listening to music; or writing down your thoughts and feelings to get them out of your head. There’s also loads of online support and advice and organisations that you can talk to for support – just choose where you live from the box at the bottom of the page and see what’s out there.
 














Need more help?
Sometimes problems are more serious or don't get better with support from schools or self-help. So you may need more specialist help. Healthy Young Minds can help!
We're an NHS Child & Adolescent Mental Health Service working across Stockport, Tameside, Glossop, Bury, Heywood, Middleton, Rochdale, Trafford and Oldham. Trained professionals can meet with you to talk about how you are feeling and the problems you are struggling with. ‘Mental health’ just means how you are feeling and coping.
If you feel that you need help from a specialist mental health service, talk to a teacher or your GP who can advise whether this is needed and help to get you an appointment.

Worried About Your Child?
Many children and young people experience emotional and behavioural problems from time to time. They may be stressed about exams, unhappy about friendship problems, confused about changes to their body, anxious about the future. They may experience worries and sadness. There is lots of advice and information online about how to help.
If you are worried about your child you can get excellent advice and support from YoungMinds.
They have a free helpline (0808 802 5544) staffed Monday to Friday.Â You can also find information on their website.
You can also get lots of information about how you can help using Mind-Ed.
Mind-Ed is an online e-portal offering free, simple advice to help adults identify, understand and support children and young people with mental health issues.
Sections about Talking to children and Is your child depressed? may be particularly helpful for parents.
There are also lot of local services which you can contact for help, support and advice before considering a specialist mental health service. Just choose your area from the drop-down box at the bottom of the page or visit our resources section for more information.














Need more help?
There is a difference between feeling worried and anxious from time to time and a serious emotional health problem. If your child's difficulties are not improving over time, or if the problems are having a significant impact on him or her, then it may be the time to get more professional help.
Any professional working with children and young people can help. If your child's problems seem centred round school then approaching a teacher or pastoral care staff member at school would be the best place to start. From there, your child might be referred for counselling.
Your GP is also well placed to discuss your concerns with you and direct you to local support such as perhaps a parenting support group.
If your child has more significant problems or if the problems not getting better, then a referral to Specialist CAMHS may be the next step.
What are Specialist CAMHS?
Specialist CAMHS are NHS mental health services that focus on the needs of children and young people with more significant mental health problems. They are multidisciplinary teams that include Psychiatrists, Psychologists, Mental Health Nurses, Mental Health Practitioners, CBT Therapists Family Therapists and Counsellors. More information can be found on the NHS website.
Healthy Young Minds is a specialist CAMH service with teams in Bury, Oldham, Heywood, Middleton & Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside & Glossop and Trafford.
My Child Is At Risk of Self-Harm or Suicide
Any self-harming or suicidal urges or behaviours need to be taken very seriously. Make an emergency appointment with your GP and seek help from Healthy Young Minds. If your child has self-harmed in any way or states that they are going to self-harm imminently, seek immediate support from A&E.

Frequently Asked Questions
Have any questions about what child and adolescent mental health services are or what we do here at Healthy Young Minds? Have a look through our FAQs to see if someone else has already asked us! If not, you can submit your question and we’ll add it to the list.


For Young People

What is CAMHS?

CAMHS is used as a term for all services that work with children and young people who have difficulties with their emotional or behavioural wellbeing. It stands for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




I don’t want to come to Healthy Young Minds, but others say I have to.

A lot of people are worried about going to a CAMH service like Healthy Young Minds and may not want to go. The reality is that no-one can make you go. And even if you get taken, no-one can make you work with a CAMHS worker. So going to CAMHS will always be your decision. On the other hand, lots of people who did not want to go at first end up being very glad they went because they got effective help. If others are worried about you, we would recommend that you go to the first appointment with an open mind and let the worker know exactly how you feel about going back. No-one will be angry and offended if you say you don’t like what CAMHS is offering. But unless you go once, it is hard to know what you are saying no to.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




I want help, but Healthy Young Minds says they can’t see me.

There are lots of services in the community and lots of people trained to offer support to young people without them needing to go to a specialist service.
If you have been seen by Healthy Young Minds for an assessment and they have asked you to go to a different service or have suggested other ways in which you can be helped, this will be because they don’t think they are the right service for you. If you do not understand why Healthy Young Minds think that, then you can ask your parent, carer or referrer to contact us again for a clear explanation of this decision. If Healthy Young Minds have said no to your referral without seeing you, then it is likely that there was not enough information in the referral. You can ask your parent, carer or referrer to contact us again with more information if you think the wrong decision was made.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




What sort of problems can Healthy Young Minds help with?

Healthy Young Minds works with children and young people with a range of emotional or behavioural problems such as anxiety, depression, OCD, trauma, eating disorders, self-harm, suicidal urges or challenging behaviours.
Healthy Young Minds also helps diagnose and then support young people with neuro-developmental disorders such as ADHD, ASD and Tic Disorders.
Healthy Young Minds does not usually work with problems like grief, anger, stress or unhappiness as these problems are usually best addressed through schools and through friends and family. Everyone has times in their life when they feel very sad and things are very difficult. It is not always helpful to see these times as being signs of mental health problems needing ‘treatment’ but as a natural part of life and living where support from friends and family and other trusted adults is the best way to move forward.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




What is it like at Healthy Young Minds?

Healthy Young Minds services try to be child-friendly and comfortable. You will be seen in a normal room not a ‘clinic’ room with a bed/sink etc. like at other hospital appointments. No-one will give you any injections or tell you off. The person or people meeting with you want to understand what you are finding hard and want to find ways of helping you. You will be listened to respectfully. You will not have to talk about anything you don’t want to talk about. You will be able to make choices about the length of the appointments and the ways in which you can be helped. You will be asked for feedback regularly and services will be as flexible as possible to offer you the treatment you find most helpful, with a person you feel comfortable with.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




How can Healthy Young Minds help?

There are different ways in which Healthy Young Minds can help. Some people find 1:1 sessions best. Others are seen with their parents or families. Sometimes parents come without young people. Sessions also vary: some treatments like CBT are structured and you will learn new behaviours and skills that you can practice at home in between sessions. Other treatments involve sand, play or art. Other treatments like counselling involve more talking and reflecting on feelings and are less structured.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




I don’t like my Healthy Young Minds worker. Can I change?

It is important that you are working with someone you feel safe and comfortable with. We would always encourage you to be honest if you do not feel your therapist is right for you. It is usually possible to change therapists unless we feel that changing is not going to help you, and may get in the way of effective treatment.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




Can I make sure I see a man or a woman if I have a preference?

Yes. Please let us know as soon as possible if this is the case, otherwise your treatment may be delayed.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




Can I bring a friend to my appointments?

You can bring anyone you trust to your first appointment. After that, you can discuss who you might like to have with you at future appointments with your Healthy Young Minds worker.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




Do my parents have to know I am coming to see you?

At Healthy Young Minds, we need parental consent to see you if you are under 16. So this means they need to know you are coming. There are other community and on-line resources that you can contact without your parents knowing. Go to our resource section for more information.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




I am being discharged but I don’t feel ready.

It can be very hard to let go of important relationships and to cope without the support of Healthy Young Minds if they have been helping you. Healthy Young Minds aims to help people develop the skills they need to cope with their own problems so discharge normally happens when a person has the ability to cope with their problems not when the problems have totally gone away. If you don’t agree that you can cope, please discuss this with your case manager as there are various ways of offering a ‘safety net’ and some on-going support even if you no longer have regular appointments.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        





General Questions about CAMHS

Is what I say confidential?

We are very keen to keep what you say confidential however there is always a limit to confidentiality.  If we are concerned about your safety or the safety of other we have a responsibility to break confidentiality. In situations when we need to share information with others we would discuss this with you and explain the reasons.


                                            If this answer hasn't helped you, you can help improve it by telling us why.
                                        




How can I complain about my treatment?

We would always encourage you to discuss concerns with your Healthy Young Minds worker in the first instance but if you don’t feel comfortable doing this, or you do not feel that your concerns have been dealt with effectively we have a complaints policy. If you use this policy it means that an independent professional will review your case thoroughly and answer all the concerns in your complaint.

About Us
One in ten children and young people have a diagnosable mental health condition, while similar numbers with less serious mental health problems will need help at some point during their development (Audit Commission 1999).
Pennine Care’s Healthy Young Minds services (previously known as CAMHS) are committed to providing a comprehensive and targeted intervention service, delivered in the heart of our communities, which positively aims to promote the emotional and psychological wellbeing of our children and young people.
The CAMHS directorate, including Healthy Young Minds community services and our Hope and Horizon inpatient units, is committed to developing our connections with other local services such as social care, paediatrics, education, health and the voluntary sector.

#Thrive
Are you feeling worried, angry or upset? Struggling to cope? Stressed about school or exams? Feeling bad about yourself? Experiencing bullying or relationship worries? Or are you just feeling a bit low and not enjoying things?
Lots of young people feel this way. 
We are #Thrive and we can help!
This page provides everything you need to know about the service.  You can also download and print off our service leaflet.
Who is the service for?
#Thrive is for children and young people aged up to 19 years.
You must live, or be registered with a GP practice (doctor), in Heywood, Middleton or Rochdale.
#Thrive can also provide advice and support to parents, carers and anyone that works with a child or young person.
Where is the service based?
You can contact us by telephone (details below) and we will arrange a time and place for you to come in and speak to us.
You can also call into our new central hub based at 48-50 Drake Street, Rochdale, OL16 1NT.  Some young people we have worked with have named this Around the Corner and it's open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 5pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays 11-6 and on Saturdays from 11 until 4. 
Around the Corner is friendly, informal and welcoming.  There is a café, where you can pop in to have a chat with our staff. You will be able to find out lots of information about the ways we can support you.
If you are unable to travel to Around the Corner, we do offer appointments at some local venues across Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale.
What support is available?
We have lots of different types of support to help you. We can also offer advice to improve your general lifestyle, including exercise, diet and many other things.
We can provide this support in lots of different ways. We will always talk to you about what support will best meet your needs.
We can offer more traditional types of support, such as one-to-one or group counselling sessions, or online courses. 
We can also signpost and help you access other types of support, such as sport, drama, music or art.  
If we aren’t able to offer the right support, we can decide together what other options are available.
It is important to have a good support network around you, so we will always try to involve those who love and care for you (or who work with you) in any support we provide. This does not necessarily need to be your parents or siblings - it can be anyone who you trust, who provides support and care to you.
Confidentiality and sharing information
We are very keen to keep what you say confidential - however there is always a limit to confidentiality.
If we are concerned about your safety, or the safety of other people, we have a responsibility to break confidentiality.  In situations where we need to share information with others, we will discuss it with you and explain the reasons.
Who runs the service?
The service is run by Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, Youth in Mind and the borough’s leisure provider Link4Life.
To make sure the service meets your needs, we are working with young people, parents, carers and professionals.  The service is funded by NHS Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale Clinical Commissioning Group and Rochdale Borough Council.
How to contact #Thrive
You can get in contact with us yourself, or ask someone you trust to contact us for you.  At the moment we're available Monday to Friday, from 9am to 5pm.  
Drop-in sessions are offered across the borough until 8pm on some days. Contact us for more information.

Eating Disorders Service
An exciting new Community Eating Disorders Service (CEDS) for children and young people launched in July 2016.
Here you can find out more about the service, including who it is for and how to get an appointment.
The service is part of Pennine Care’s Healthy Young Minds Service (formerly known as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service - CAMHS). 
It provides dedicated care and support to children and young people with an eating disorder.  It also offers advice and support to families, carers and those who work with, or support, a child or young person. 
About the service
Previously, most children and young people with an eating disorder were seen within our community Healthy Young Minds Service.
However, research has shown that dedicated community-based services for eating disorders achieve better outcomes.
This research, along with guidance from NHS England (Access and Waiting Times Standard for Children and Young People with an Eating Disorder), has seen clinical commissioning groups across the Pennine Care footprint (*) fund this new service. 
(*) The Pennine Care footprint includes:  Bury; Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale (HMR); Oldham; Stockport; Tameside and Glossop; and Trafford.
The new Community Eating Disorders Service is part of our existing community-based Healthy Young Mind Service.  It aims to enhance the care and treatment that has previously been available by offering the following benefits:
• Earlier identification and support• Intensive community-based treatment• Co-management of inpatient admissions (working with hospital-based child and adolescent mental health staff)• Extending care and treatment to young people aged up to 18 years across all boroughs (was previously only available up to 16 years in some boroughs)
What does the service provide?
The service offers children and young people a full assessment and NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) approved care, advice and treatment.  The service is being rolled out in a phased approach - and phase two is now live.  
During this phase the service will: 

Continue to provide urgent home-based treatment for young people aged under 16 years. This includes interventions such as meal time support.
Begin to offer enhanced planned home-based treatment for young people aged under 16 years.
Begin to take over the care of young people aged 17 years from the core Healthy Young Minds Service. Significant planning will go into the transition of their care, to ensure it is smooth, joined up and does not have a negative impact on young people’s progress. The process will be undertaken in partnership with young people, along with their families or carers where appropriate.
Begin to deliver support sessions and workshops to young people aged 14 years and above – along with their families and carers, where appropriate. This will focus on topics such as body image, self-esteem, parental support, mindfulness and relaxation.
Offer bespoke training to those who work with or care for young people. This will be done in partnership with national charity B-eat
Establish an eating disorders champion in each borough’s core Healthy Young Minds (HYM) Service. This will enable the HYM and CEDS staff to better work together to support the different needs of young people.
Continue to develop a central hub for the North Team and the South Team (see below for details). 

Where is the service based?
The new service is delivered by two teams:• North Team: covering Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale, Bury and Oldham• South Team:  covering Stockport, Tameside and Glossop and Trafford
Currently the service is provided in a range of community-based venues across each borough.
In the near future, the North Team and South Team will be based in a central hub, which will offer drop-in support sessions, as well as appointments. 
To ensure you don’t always have to travel to the hub, a number of ‘spoke clinics’ will also be offered across each borough.  
We are aiming to open the new hubs in the next few months.  Look out for further details.
What next for the service?
The third phase will launch in January 2017. In addition to the care and treatment detailed above, the service will also begin to:

Take over the care of young people aged 16 years from the core Healthy Young Minds Service
Offer seven day triage of new referrals for 16 to 18 year olds
Launch the new hubs for the north and south teams (it is hoped that the south hub will be ready to open in the next couple of months)
Further develop close working arrangements with a range of support services from the third sector in each borough and further afield

Hope and Horizon Units
There are times when young people need to come into hospital and your community worker may speak with you about making a referral to the inpatient units at Pennine Care. We have two units, the Hope and the Horizon Units, which are situated within Fairfield Hospital in Bury and provide treatment and support, in a safe and caring environment, to young people aged between 13 and 18 years old who are suffering from a range of mental health difficulties.
Coming into hospital can sometimes feel like a scary thing especially if you have never been away from home before. Some young people may find it difficult living on a ward with others but it’s important to remember that everyone comes into hospital because of some kind of difficulty they’re experiencing and everyone has different needs. The staff will do all they can to help you settle in onto the ward and all the team are very friendly. If you find any part of being in hospital difficult, staff are always around for you to speak to.
To make you feel more at home during your stay, you're able to personalise your own modern and comfortable room, which comes with an en-suite bathroom and shower.
And as well as a number of living areas you'll share with the other young people on the ward, there are also communal games areas where you can relax, have fun and interact with the other young people on the unit.
There's also a unique outdoor tree house-style facility called the Woodland Retreat, with a decked area, barbeque and an allotment, which is a great place for you to take time to de-stress and enjoy some fresh air in a peaceful and relaxing environment.
