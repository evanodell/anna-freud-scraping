A Little Bit About Us





Crisis Pregnancy Care is a charity established in 2007 to help women in crisis due to pregnancy or pregnancy loss. We are from all kinds of backgrounds with the single aim of being there to support people whatever the need may be. 
	

We offer both professional counselling and practical support. We rely heavily on unpaid volunteers and the support of many people around Calderdale to be able to make a difference to those in need.
	

We are open Mondays 12-2pm and Thursdays 2-4pm for anyone to drop in and talk to us or request help. Counselling clients usually make appointments to see us at other times, depending on when the room is available. If you have clothes or baby equipment to donate, please email us or call our mobile. If you need to talk to us, we are available on the mobile for free confidential support.

As we are a small charity, we struggle for income and rely heavily on volunteers, who are amazing by the way. We are always on the lookout for more ways to raise funds so that we can keep going. 



You can now help us by registering at Give as You Live, so that every time you make a purchase online, a fraction is donated to us for free! We know you'd love to sign up for that so here's the link:  https://www.giveasyoulive.com/charity/crisis-pregnancy-care







May 2016




We have been granted £1,000 for running costs by Locala. Thank you so much! Two of us went to Holmfirth to meet them and we had a really lovely time. You can find out more about locala here

November 2015




We registered at Give As You Live, every time somebody makes an online purchase they donate a fraction of the spend to charity. Our supporters can register here at http://give.as/charity/crisis-pregnancy-care

We also signed up to everyclick.com who donate funds for free whenever our supporters browse the internet. And we also signed up to the Sainsbury's card. This was a prepaid card that donated 4% to charity. This has finished but it meant that every time £50 was added Sainsbury's automatically sent us £2! There will be new card coming soon to replace it. We'll add the details when they are released.





May 2015




Child Poverty Trust - donated £9,000 to us, this means we can expand into Ovenden, an area with a lot of low income familes





January 2015




We now have three regular supporters who make a monthly payment by standing order! They are amazing. Maybe you could join them? The more the merrier





November 2014




Surveys! Lots of them. We were part of a scheme to get the views of local people and were rewarded for each one our contacts returned. This raised £120 for CPC. Previous surveys have raised £262 for us.  If you have any more - you know where to send them! 





October 2013





We received a grant from the NHS for £6,000 to help pay for running costs 
Leeds Building Society donated £500 for second-hand baby equipment 
The Rotary Club donated £500 for us to "do good" - we did!






July 2013




We held our first ever Tea Party and we raised £372! It wasn't perfect but we had a lot of fun! It was at the King's Church Cafe and lots of lovely people donated food, including The Merrie England Cafe in Halifax (thank you) and a local youth group helped out as waitresses

What's This About Counselling?




The thought of seeing a counsellor can be a little scary to some people: talking about feelings is not something we are always comfortable with. Especially in the case of an unplanned pregnancy or a pregnancy loss. Some people can feel guilty or fearful or even stupid for wanting to talk about it. 

The main emphasis of our charity is ordinary women who have themselves suffered these situations (not all of them at once!) but between us we have all been in the same situations. By the way we have trained a few men and we will always see men as well as women, it's just the vast majority of our clients tend to be female. 

While the person you talk to may not have been in the exact same position, each one of us is trained to listen. We will not label you or dismiss how you are feeling. We aim to support you as best as we can. 

We can support clients experiencing a crisis pregnancy, and afterwards; clients who have suffered miscarriage, stillbirth and abortion; clients who are new parents. Basically if you've had a baby in the last year you can come to see us and also if you've experienced any kind of pregnancy loss - and for that there is no time limit.





What To Expect




It may be that all you need is to talk on the phone but we think making an appointment to see us is better as there are no distractions. 

It's fine if you only need to come the once, many do that. Others need to see us four to six times or more and that's also fine. The first time you call in, we go through it all with you.

We prefer to see counselling clients outside of the drop-in but we can be flexible so let us know what times work best for you. Our counsellors have both crisis counselling training and grief/loss training, accredited with the ACC and we work according to both the ACC and BACP Codes of Ethics as well as ongoing regular supervision. One of us is also a Registered Member of the BACP. If you need to know anything else about our counselling, please don't hesitate to email us at info@cpchalifax.org.uk
