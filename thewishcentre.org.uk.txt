Safe 2 Speak Counselling



Are you are you between 10 and 19 years old?
Do you feel like you have nowhere to turn and no one to trust?
Maybe you are self-harming or experiencing violence at home?
You could be being neglected or being abused?
We are here to offer you confidential support.
Safe2Speak is a free and confidential counselling and support service for 10 – 19 year olds, where you can talk to somebody about it. It is for young people who self harm, feel suicidal, or have experienced domestic or sexual violence, abuse or neglect.  Everything you tell us is in confidence. We won’t tell your parents, teachers or anyone else without your agreement.
If you tell us something that makes us feel you are not safe we may need to discuss this with other professionals, but will explain this to you in more detail at your first session.
We can see you  every week either in school or at our centre in Harrow or Merton. If you for any reason you cant see us face to face we can offer you online counselling.
Get confidential support:

Sexual Violence & Abuse



Sexual violence and abuse is any behaviour perceived to be of a sexual nature which is unwanted and takes place without consent or understanding. It is a crime and can happen to anyone, men and women, young people and children, but it is never their fault. It has a devastating impact on victims, their families and friends and wider society, and the impact on individuals is likely to affect mental, physical and sexual health.
It can range from flashing and unwanted touching (groping) to sexual abuse and rape. No matter what a person was doing, where they were, what they were wearing or if they’d been drinking or were under the influence of drugs, they were not ‘asking for it’ or allowing themselves to be raped or sexually assaulted. No one deserves to be sexually violated!
Types of sexual violence include – but are not limited to:
• Rape
• Sexual assault or threats
• Hate crime
• Sexual exploitation
• Unwanted or inappropriate sexual contact or touching
• Sexual harassment – including demanding sex in return for favours
• Exposure or flashing
• Ritual abuse
• Domestic violence
• Forced participation in / watching of pornography
• Threats
• Sexting
• Stalking or cyberstalking
• Exposing young people to sexual activities
• Forced prostitution
• Trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation
• Peeping
• Female genital mutilation (FGM)
• Incest
If you have experienced physical or sexual abuse – contact us.

Self harm support group



Girls Xpress! is an award winning peer support group for girls and female to male transgender young people who self harm and who are between the  ages 13-18.
“We are a self-help, peer support and counselling group who also campaign to improve awareness of and services to support young women who self harm. We are young women aged 13 -19 and are a mixture of girls in school, in care, and excluded. Many of us have been referred by agencies or schools; some are self-referred. Everything we do is in total confidence. We believe that through our activities and befriending support we are happier. We also provide text and msn support, and a crisis programme.” – The Girls Xpress! Group
Girls Xpress! meets every week for a mix of peer support and help with managing self harming and other things going on. Everyone stays in touch  during the week and you will have text and online support when you most need it. If you feel alone, like you don’t fit in and no one understands then be brave enough to give group a try, You will never regret it!
“WISH and Girls Xpress have helped me so much over the last couple of years, and even now when I’m away from the group they keep me a part of something that has really become a big part of my life. All of the employees and girls alike keep a very welcoming environment for everybody. It’s a place to go and not be judged but be helped. WISH gave me somewhere to go when I was at my lowest point, and something to be proud of now that I am at my highest. It is somewhere I will always call home, and a place where hopes and dreams are made.” – Sian

Rape & Consent




Rape is an act of sexual violence which involves forcing someone to engage in sexual acts involving penetration against her/his will.
This includes non-consensual vaginal, oral and/or anal penetration, however slight, with any object.
The law
The law states that rape happens when one person intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person without their consent i.e in the knowledge that the person is not agreeing to this.
According to the law, the person who commits the offence of rape must be a man (as the penetration has to be with a penis). If non-consensual penetration is with something other than a penis, then the offence is assault by penetration. A woman or a man might also be charged with or convicted of ‘rape as a secondary party’ where she or he has assisted a man in the rape of another person.
Consent
A person consents if they agree to sex by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice.
The type of circumstances where consent might be deemed NOT to be given includes:
• Use of violence, threats or unlawful detention
• When the victim is intoxicated, drugged, asleep, unconscious, or below the age of consent (age 16).
• When the victim is unable to communicate their consent because of a disability
If you think you have been raped or sexually assaulted – contact us.

Stay Safe



Sexual violence includes any sexual act without a person’s consent – it can even happen by someone you know well e.g. boyfriend, husband, friend and family member.
Here are some ideas and tips to help you stay safe:
• Don’t leave your drink unattended
• Never get into an unlicensed cab
• If someone pressures you to do something and it feels weird – trust your instincts – don’t go along with it. Tell someone you trust.
• Don’t share personal info (address, phone number and name) with someone in chatrooms/online.
• Think Twice – Don’t send nude or semi-nude photos to anyone online/via your phone – these images could be sent around and seen by friends, family, a future employer or even an offender.
• Use your privacy settings on the internet where you can control who can message you and who can see your personal information.
• Don’t give too much information away on blog e.g. information about where you live.
• Trust your instincts
If you need to talk about any of these issues and would like advice or support here are some useful contact numbers.
In an emergency or danger always call 999 
In non-emergency or to report a crime or speak to a police officer call 101

The Internet & Social Media



Internet safety is a growing issue as more and more young people have access to online services.
WISH are committed to protecting young people from sexual exploitation, online grooming and cyber bullying. We have seen a steady increase in reported sexual abuse which has started online through social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter), mobiles, gaming, chat rooms (Omegle), IM or other e-messaging services.
Online protection is now a global challenge! The effects of sharing personal information or indecent pictures online can be long-term.
Watch our 2 minute film about sexual exploitation:

If you are feeling pressured to do things online you don’t want to or are being harassed online – contact us.
Need advice on how to use social media sites safely visit ThinkYouKnow.
For more information on safety using social networking sites visit their safety pages – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Ask.FM.

Self Harm Support



The WISH Centre supports young people who self harm through a combination of peer support programmes, counselling, youth projects and individual support plans and campaigning. The work we do has been developed with young people who self harm and we understand that part of a healing journey involves finding a voice in the public domain which is why we also have a focus on media and awareness raising projects.
Frequently Asked Question’s
What is self harm?Who self harms?Why self harm?How to stop self harming?

Self harm is when somebody intentionally damages or injures their body. Whilst normally associated with cutting, self harm can take many forms:
• Self-Injury – Cutting, swallowing objects, insertion of foreign objects into body, burning, stabbing.
• Self-Poisoning – Overdosing with medicines, swallowing poisonous substance.


Research suggests that over 1 in 9 teenagers are self harming (Nat Inquiry 2006), and some recent reports suggest the figure is as high as 1 in 5 (Affinity for NHS 2008). As nearly 50% of self harmers do so secretly, this is clearly the tip of the iceberg.
7 out of 10 self harmers in the UK are female. However, evidence suggests that the rates of boys who are self harming has doubled in the past decade and is on the increase.
There is no typical self harmer. The only commonality is the level of personal distress they are facing and the need for a coping or survival strategy in the face of terrible secrets or pain that cannot be spoken.
Common reasons for a young person self harming include family breakdown, experiencing family violence or sexual violence, child abuse, teenage pregnancy, entering or leaving care, living with some form of oppression. There are many other reasons, and triggers such as bullying or difficult relationships, gender and sexuality issues, identity problems may lead to self harm or an increase in using self harm as a way of coping.


In the States, most young people who self harm are assumed to be victims of child abuse. While there are very strong links between self harm and child sexual, emotional or physical abuse in the UK, we have seen that other causes may be family attachments or displacements, one or a series of traumatic incidents, difficulties with self-esteem, identity and relationships.
Self harm may be triggered under stressful circumstances such as being bullied, peer or school pressure, family divorce etc.
Self harm is not attention seeking. It is drawing attention to the pain inside.
It is a presenting symptom that needs to be supported but the causes should be uncovered.
Self harm is a way of coping. Any attempts to coerce a young person to stop self harming, and therefore take away their means of coping without appropriate support in place, may lead to an increase in any suicide ideation.


Self Harm is not attempted suicide although there are links – over 50% of suicides of young people last year were shown to have self harmed in the previous year.
Self Harm is a coping or survival strategy. Some people self harm to calm themselves when distressed – a release where physical pain blocks the emotional pain. Others self harm to stop themselves from disassociating or feeling numb – its helps them to feel again and when they see blood it affirms they are alive.
Self harm serves it purpose and as a result is highly addictive both physically, psychologically and behaviourally. It is now recognised that classic mental health, medical or alternative treatments do not impact effectively on self harm.
The evidence base suggests that a combination of young person focused environments with a mix of peer mentoring and support, person centred therapy and support plans have the greatest impact. This is how we work at WISH and are also able to offer opportunities for talent and skills development.
We believe that self harmers need an integrated approach to support and recovery, working with the whole person to build confidence, control, self esteem, new skills and understanding. Self harmers tell us they also need something to replace their self harm. This is an individual journey.

Schools & EducationFamilies & CarersResourcesTraining

WISH are working with local schools to develop guidelines for dealing with self harm in the school setting. We are able to provide tailored training and awareness sessions for teachers and pupils, including PSHE.


WISH is exploring funding to develop a support programme for families and carers that is focused both on awareness of and prevention of self harm and on supporting the young self harmer in their recovery.
