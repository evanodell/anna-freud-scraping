Double Donation from DoubleTree

We had a wonderful surprise last week when a team from Double Tree by Hilton Newbury North arrived to present us with a cheque.


We received an amazing donation of £1,474 which was the money raised from the past two quiz evenings – both of which were great fun and a huge success.
Watch this space for another quiz later this year.

			Tor Sandars, 6 June 2017		












THE OFFICIAL OPENING

On Friday 19th May we officially opened our play facility for families with special needs children at A Place to Play, Lower Way Thatcham. The opening event was attended by many long-standing supporters as well as representatives from local businesses, a lot of whom gave up their time free of charge to help us with our move.


Sian Cook said: “We had begun to outgrow the Phoenix Resource Centre and needed more space including outdoor and to be able to increase our opening times. Our potential demand is increasing year on year and the Lower Way building offers a good, secure outdoor space. It’s very important for the children who come to us to be able to enjoy outside play so the new base is perfect for us. Our thanks go to all those companies and individuals who helped us with the move.”
Companies who helped with the move include:
A Brush Above The Rest; Arena Security; Buildbase; Bonkers Play;  Calco; David Wilson Homes; Floorcraft; The Freemasons; Grundon; ITQ; Mercedes; Marshalls Chartered Surveyors; MFG;  Moore Blatch Solicitor;  Opemed; Rapid Clean; Russell Evans Chartered Surveyors; Scofell; Service Master; SpaceKraft; Westronics;
Following the Open Evening, there was a weekend of action-packed fun. Saturday afternoon saw Swings & Smiles host a Harry Potter Themed Grand Opening for all its families with 106 people attending.

MAY FAIR SUCCESS

On 30th April the Royal Oak in Ecchinswell hosted the village May Fair for the 4th consecutive year. The event was a great success and drew in crowds from far and wide. There was a host of different activities on offer and everyone had a fantastic time. Fortunately, the rain held off all day.


The event raised an amazing £2,500 for us and we are extremely grateful to Chris and Laura from the Royal Oak, along with all the Committee members, who worked so hard to make this such a success. It is thanks to support like this that we can continue to provide our invaluable service for families with special needs children. Thank You.

			Tor Sandars, 5 June 2017		












Curry & Quiz Success

The Hilton Newbury North hosted yet another wonderful quiz night


The team at The Hilton did us proud yet again and raised over £950 in the process. We are delighted that Roland Gardner and his team came away with the honours of winning as well having the fewest team members on the night – no mean feat! Thank you to everyone at The Hilton for making it such a success and to all those of you who came along on the evening and supported the event. 

			Tor Sandars, 21 February 2017		












Candlelight Carols

Swings & Smiles’ annual Candlelight Carol Service took place at St Mark’s Church in Englefield on Thursday 8th December.
 


The event was attended by patrons Chris Tarrant OBE, Mary Cameron and Richard Benyon MP. Victoria Fishburn, High Sheriff of Berkshire and Allen Sinclair from the BBC were also in attendance and gave readings.
It was a wonderful occasion with Swings & Smiles children providing some of the music as well as Englefield Primary School Choir.

			Tor Sandars, 12 December 2016		












A Golfing Triumph

Donnington Valley Golf Club Host our Annual Golf Day


A huge thanks must go to The Vineyard Group and Donnington Valley Golf Club for hosting our Annual Golf Day on 30th September. 14 teams took to the greens on a beautiful sunny day and fun was had by all. Thanks to the generosity of The Vineyard Group and the participants an amazing £2,500 was raised which will go towards our permanent site for which we are busy fundraising. 

			Tor Sandars, 4 October 2016		












The Power of Pavlova

Cote Restaurants donate an amazing £65,759 through sales of pavlova


Throughout September, all the proceeds from the sale of Cote’s monthly special dessert of seasonal Pavlova have been donated to Swings & Smiles, A staggering total of £65,759 has been raised through this initiative. Sian Cook, Founder of Swings & Smiles was thrilled when Alex Scrimgeour, CEO of Cote Restaurants, suggested the promotion after hearing about the charity’s need to fund the build of its new facility. At least £450k needs to be raised and so the incredible £65,759 raised throughout all 80 Cote Restaurants will make a significant contribution towards reaching this target. She said: ‘We are overwhelmed by Cote’s generosity. It has been an incredible fundraising initiative and we are so grateful to everyone at Cote and their customers for their kindness and generosity in getting us well and truly on our way to reaching our goal and establishing our long term future.’

			Tor Sandars, 4 October 2016		












Quiztastic

The Hilton Newbury North came up trumps yet again with the hosting of a fantastic quiz night.


It was the first time The Hilton have hosted a quiz at their Newbury North hotel. Sam Farmer, Manager, did a sterling job as compere and the questions were just the right balance for most people on the night!
Our very own Laura Lewis and Sara East and their team members named the ‘Quiztina Aguilera Team’ came first for the second time running.
A total of more than £525 was raised which will go towards equipping our new sensory room at our new site once this is finalised.
Thank You to everyone at The Hilton who made it such a fun evening – yet again! Not to mention the delicious curry and chocolate brownies.

			Tor Sandars, 19 September 2016		












Super Summer

The six week holidays have flown past at Swings & Smiles with us offering short breaks, outreach sessions and lots of family play at the centre.


We’ve had a great time travelling about in our van, kindly funded by Global Make Some Noise. Swings & Smiles – Out & About has seen us travel around the South of England delivering sensory play sessions in Witney, RAF Benson and Bushey in Hertfordshire.
Our short break sessions have also been popular, we have provided 26 hours of support for families at this sometimes stressful time of year. Children that attended these sessions did so without their parents or siblings and took part in cooking, art and lots of playing.
For the team at Swings & Smiles the summer holidays has been full of super families (new and old), masses of fun and some fabulous memories. We’re already looking forward to next year!

			Laura Lewis, 2 September 2016		












RUNNING FOR SWINGS & SMILES

Last month, Daniel Reeves, took part in a gruelling challenge to raise money for Swings & Smiles. He undertook the ultimate test of stamina by competing in the Marathon Des Sables. In total, he ran 4 marathons and one ultra marathon in six days in the blistering heat of the Sahara Desert.
 


Sian commented: “Dan raised a staggering £7,422 and the money he raised will help us continue to support the families who come to Swings & Smiles and also give us the opportunity to reach out and support many more families who benefit from what we can offer. We receive no funding from our local authority and are totally reliant on the generosity of people like Dan. Well done and thank you Dan!”

Amy’s Cupcake

Posted on April 23, 2014May 13, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


Towards the end of last year Hetherton’s teamed up with The Newbury Weekly News to invite youngsters to design ‘Amy’s Cupcake’. The prize was that the winning cupcake would then be baked and sold in-store to raise money for Swings & Smiles.
Hetherton’s arranged a wonderful tea party to mark the launch of the cupcake and, at the same time, presented us with a cheque for over £500. This was as a result of proceeds from the sales of Amy’s Loaf.
We can’t begin to thank Hetherton’s for their on-going wonderful support for us it really is amazing and we thoroughly enjoy working alongside them.

They clearly have a talent for this because they managed to raise a staggering £178 in just a few hours.

Grand Opening

Posted on June 30, 2014October 2, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


This means that we can now offer families with special needs children in and around West Berkshire a play facility where the whole family can play together – something most families take for granted. We offer wonderful facilities which include a soft play room; sensory room; optimusic room; art room and state of the art personal care rooms.
We would like to thank our patrons Mary Cameron, Graeme Murty and Richard Benyon MP for hosting the launch event with us and to Clare Balding for producing a video for the evening. And we hope that Peter Baker, another of our patrons, gets better soon as we unable to join us.
Please do come and visit us and see for yourselves the fantastic facilities that we can offer to you as a family.

The Big Wheel Bike Ride

Posted on June 29, 2014October 2, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


The sun shone throughout and everyone from the keen cyclists to the young families had an amazing day out. The bike ride starts at Hungerford Common and makes its way through stunning countryside to the Savernake Forest where a BBQ is laid on for all participants and their supporters. Once refuelled, everyone sets off for the final 10 mile to the finish line. The Savernake Forest is also where the cycle route for families with younger children starts. All three cycle routes were a great success and over 160 cyclists took part.

Big Thanks To Vodafone

Posted on June 4, 2014October 2, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


All the walls have been painted, shelving and drying racks installed, blackboard paint put on one wall so that children can write and draw on this wall. A huge thank you to all those of you who came to help and were so cheerful in the process.
But that is not all, the Vodafone Foundation also donated in the region of £1,000 for our new Art Room so that all this was possible. A big thank you to Vodafone and The Vodafone Foundation from all of us at Swings & Smiles.

Downe House Do It Again!

Posted on June 19, 2014October 2, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


They spent all morning cutting, pasting and sticking to provide us with enough templates for our themed activities in the months to come – from cut out elephants, to designing flags, to cutting out fabric to resemble jellyfish tentacles!
We really do appreciate their help – many hands made light work and it was lovely that they all joined in with such enthusiasm and good humour – thank you to you all.

Cycling for Swings & Smiles

Posted on October 7, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


Martin Graham, his two sons Harry and Jack and his two nephews Joseph and Oliver decided to embark upon a challenge to cycle 1000 miles over 12 days in the middle of summer from London to North West Italy. They followed an old pilgrim’s trail scaling numerous peaks including the Alps and went through a total of seven different countries.
In total, they raised a staggering £12,977 which they split between Swings & Smiles and Cystic Fibrosis. Pippa Graham, daughter of Martin Graham, is one of the play leaders at Swings & Smiles.

Family Fun Day

Posted on September 27, 2014October 7, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


There was a raft of activities on offer to suit all ages including Art and Music Workshops; Penalty Shoot-Outs with Thatcham Tornadoes; Face Painting; a Silent Auction and lots more.
The Family Fun Day was an enormous success with families clearly having a wonderful time. The attendance was fantastic and it was lovely to see so many people able to enjoy the facilities we have on offer.

Rain Stopped Play!

Posted on October 10, 2014October 13, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


Due to thunder and lightning play ceased after 14 holes. However, this did not dampen the spirits of all the competitors.
The winning team, Greatworth, with a score of 67 was captained by Charlie Woodhead who was accompanied by Peter Horton, Ker Gilchrist and Richard Prosser. The second team, Norfolk & Chance B, was only one point behind with a score of 67. This team was captained by Mark Dillon and comprised of Jock Douglas, Chris Terrett and Mark Sims. Two points behind the second tea, was Scofell, captained by Simon Walker, and accompanied by Angus Breton, Peter Benson and Roderick Grafton.
Other winners on the day was Johnnie Green who won the longest drive, Charles Dixon, who won the straightest drive and the winner of the nearest the pin was Shaun Hawkins.
But the main winner of the day was Swings & Smiles who benefitted from just over £3k raised from the generous support of all the competitors via a raffle and auction.
Special thanks goes to Jock Harmer of W.W.Giles (Smithfields) Ltd, who sponsored the day for the second year running.

Make Some Noise

Posted on October 13, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


Fundraising has begun and grants are being awarded to projects across the country that help children and young people affected by illness, disability, bereavement or lack of opportunity.
Global is a Media & Entertainment Company which is home to the famous brands Heart FM, Classic FM, Smooth, Capital FM and others reaching a combined 23.2 million people every week. These stations all joined forces to unite behind this one cause of making a difference to young people’s lives.
The first ‘Make Some Noise’ charity appeal culminated in ‘Make Some Noise Day’ on Thursday 9th October. This saw Sian and Tor head to Leicester Square in London to help the ‘Make Some Noise Cycling Challenge’ to cycle the distance between John O’Groats and Land’s End in a day. The cycling took place on the roof of Global FM’s offices and the full distance was achieved with the help of well-known celebrities including Emma Bunton, Jenni Falconer, Christopher Dean and Jayne Torvill and Olly Murs, to name but a few!

Thatcham Tornadoes Strike Again

Posted on October 22, 2014November 20, 2014 by Laura Lewis 


The Scouts put on a BBQ despite the rather damp conditions and, all in all, everyone had a thoroughly enjoyable morning. As part of the event the SPX Thatcham Tornadoes put on the speedshot with children seeing just how fast they could kick the ball into the goal. The fastest time was the winner and all the proceeds from this will be donated to Swings & Smiles. A huge thank you to the organisers for supporting Swings & Smiles for the second year running.

Candlelight Carol Service

Posted on December 8, 2014December 9, 2014 by Tor Sandars 


This took place at St Mark’s Church, Englefield. Almost 200 people attended the service which was a very special evening set in a beautiful church which looked stunning in the candlelight. There were four readings which were kindly read by The Hon Mrs Bayliss JP – Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire, Richard Benyon MP and Patron of Swings & Smiles, Mary Cameron, Patron of Swings & Smiles and Chris Tarrant OBE.
Other performances included a solo of ‘The Candle Song’ by Sayer Willett, ‘Midwinter’ and ‘Ding Dong Merrily On High’ by St Gabriel’s School Choir and ‘The Little Matchgirl’ by pupils from Brookfields School.
Chris Tarrant rounded off the service with an appeal on behalf of Swings & Smiles.
We are very grateful to our three key sponsors: Haslams; Ntegra and Donnington New Homes and to all our friends, families and supporters who came along to make the event such a success. The event raised £3,000 which will be put towards the running of our service at The Phoenix Resource Centre which is helping so many families with special needs children in and around West Berkshire. Thank you to all those of you who generously gave donations on the evening.
It was lovely to see you all and we wish you all a very Happy Christmas.

Goodbye and Thank You

Posted on March 4, 2015March 4, 2015 by Tor Sandars 


We are very sad to announce that one of our longest standing Trustees, Mike Reynolds CBE, has retired from being a Trustee. Mike has been with us from the start and helped us with our set up in 2007. Since then he has provided invaluable support  and advice along the way and we wouldn’t have got to where we are today without his unwavering support.
We would like to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to Mike and to say that he will be sorely missed. We wish him all the best and know that we will see him at forthcoming Swings & Smiles events.

We did it!

Posted on March 24, 2015March 24, 2015 by Tor Sandars 


It was a beautiful sunny day and the atmosphere was fantastic. Our fastest runner, Jamie Tardi, finished in 1 hour and 37 minutes which is no mean feat. We are all so pleased to have finished the event despite our sore legs and even a bit of sunburn! Thank you to everyone who took part to raise money for us and to everyone who so generously sponsored us – we wouldn’t be where we are today without your fantastic support.

The Big Wheel Bike Ride

Posted on June 22, 2015June 22, 2015 by Tor Sandars 


Over 150 cyclists turned up on what was a beautiful sunny day to take part in one of the three three cycle rides on offer – these ranged from a 33 mile off road; 26 mile family route or 12 mile cycle ride for those with younger children. Everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves and, having completed the ride, tucked into a delicious BBQ at Hungerford Rugby Club at the end.  A huge thank you to everyone who took part but also to W.W. Giles for providing all the meat for the BBQ and to Scofell Landscaping who helped us strim all the cycle paths in preparation for the day.

Thank You Atkinson Keene

Posted on June 22, 2015 by Tor Sandars 


18th and 19th June saw a wonderful photo exhibition at Newbury Town Hall. Local photographer and keen cyclist, Tony Silver, donated some of his favourite pictures taken whilst out cycling, to create a wonderful exhibition. Thanks to the help of Atkinson Keene, the photographs were mounted onto canvas and sold to members of the public. Tony Silver very kindly donated all the proceeds to Swings & Smiles and Dementia UK.

Every year, the Hilton Foundation worldwide, embarks on a virtual ‘Cycle Around the World in a Day’ challenge. This took place on Saturday 20th June in Northbrook Street. A huge thank you to all our volunteers and Trustees who took to the bicycles to help The Hilton Foundation achieve this at the same time as helping to raise money for us.

Downe House Buskers

Posted on July 3, 2015July 3, 2015 by Tor Sandars 


They were given a very warm welcome and managed to double the amount of money raised for us when compared with last year – donating a fantastic £470 to us. Downe House girls are regular volunteers for us at The Phoenix Resource Centre and are often found in the Art Room getting their hands dirty, providing us with wonderful much needed help. Thank you very much to everyone at Downe House who has continued to support us for many years we really do appreciate your help.

Thank You to Wolseley

Posted on July 7, 2015July 7, 2015 by Tor Sandars 


In the space of just one day, a team of people from Wolseley came to The Phoenix Resource Centre where they transformed rooms and the outside area for us. The sensory room and snack bar are now both newly painted giving both rooms a fresh and welcoming feel.
What is more, they completely transformed our outside area. Hazel wood panels were put up along the length of the garden area making it completely safe for our families and their children. Raised beds and flower beds were completely rid of all their weeds and new plants were bought to put in place of the weeds! The whole area was pressure hosed and then new toys and play equipment were installed – all very generously purchased for us by Wolseley. The children now have their very own giant Connect4 and basketball hoop as well as a water tray for muddy and wet play!
Thank you very much to everyone who came along on the day and worked incredibly hard to make this all possible for us – we really do appreciate you giving up your valuable time and doing it all so cheerfully – it was a pleasure to have you around! Thank You!

Golfing Glory

Posted on October 7, 2015October 7, 2015 by Tor Sandars 


A total of 14 teams braved not only the fairways but also the weather at times! Donnington Valley Golf Club provided the perfect setting for this wonderful day out and fun was had by all. DHL were the winning team and Swings & Smiles were also winners because, thanks to everyone’s wonderful generosity, around £2,400 was raised. A huge thank you must go to Donnington Valley Golf Club for providing us with the venue and Donnington Valley Hotel for the most delicious food and wine. A big thank you also goes to Infiniti who were  sponsors of the day.
We are already looking forward to next year!

Dress Loud in Style

Posted on October 9, 2015 by Tor Sandars 


Global’s Make Some Noise is a national charity, established in 2014, that helps disadvantaged children and young people across the UK –   funding projects which support youngsters who may have been affected by illness, disability, bereavement or lack of opportunity.
A group of families who use Swings & Smiles helped launch the day with their ‘Dress Loud‘ campaign. Costa Coffee in Parkway Shopping Centre invited Swings & Smiles to promote this campaign at their store.
A huge thank you to Kellie and Julie for organising such a great event and helping us to continue to raise our profile.

Awesome Aerobathon!

Posted on November 3, 2015November 3, 2015 by Laura Lewis 


Fitness instructors Suzi Moores and Sam Gromett put thirty-five of us through our paces for over 2 hours at Park House school to raise funds for Swings & Smiles.  Suzi’s daughter Lexie attends Swings & Smiles and along with brother Maxwell they always have a great time at the centre which inspired Suzi to want to lead this super event.
Fancy lycra and tutus were the order of the day and a very healthy £350 was raised.  We ended the morning with a pasta lunch and a mountain of cupcakes that had been kindly baked by volunteers from Downe House School.
Even though there were a lot of achy limbs the next day watch this space as we’ll be doing it all over again in 2016!!

Spooky Spectacular

Posted on November 3, 2015 by Laura Lewis 


The rooms and halls of the Phoenix Resource Centre were given a ghostly makeover on Friday 30th October when we held our annual Halloween celebration.
Children, parents and staff all got into the spirit and dressed up in their finest scary outfits to enjoy this special evening.
Alongside all the usual fun in the softplay room there were arts and crafts, jelly dipping, an amazing buffet and a rather noisy disco.  We all finished the evening off with a trip around the centre corridors knocking on doors and seeing if we would get a trick or a treat!
All money raised from the party will go towards the resources required to keep running play sessions at the Phoenix Resource Centre throughout the year.  A huge thanks to the Hilton for their support at this event.

Christmas is Coming

Posted on November 3, 2015 by Tor Sandars 


Sarah, Pam and Lynn had worked incredibly hard to create a fabulous festive occasion with about a dozen stalls selling beautiful jewellery, handmade chocolates,, candles, stylish clothing and many more. The entry price of £3 included delicious homemade cakes. Everyone was incredibly generous with £600 being raised. We are incredibly grateful to all who were so generous and to Sarah, Pam and Lynn for choosing Swings & Smiles to benefit.

Substantial support from the Big Lottery Fund

Posted on January 15, 2016February 3, 2016 by Tor Sandars 


We now have more than 230 families registered – no mean feat considering we only opened our doors in June 2014. The grant will go towards the running costs of the facility to ensure the continuation of our incredibly valuable service.
Sian Cook comments: “I can’t describe the pleasure we have seeing families visit us on a regular basis and watching the children and their parents benefit from their time with us. This is what I set out to achieve in 2007 and it is wonderful to see it come to fruition and to know we are helping to enrich their lives. Thanks to the Big Lottery Fund we now know we are able to continue to offer this essential service for years to come. Their endorsement gives us tremendous credibility and provides us with a secure platform on which to build for the future.”
Swings & Smiles has, as yet, not achieved its long-term goal of having its own dedicated site. Significant effort is being put into finding a suitable site and any future fundraising will be targeted toward achieving this.

Quiz Tarrant Success

Posted on March 22, 2016March 22, 2016 by Tor Sandars 


Held at the stunning Englefield House, home to Richard Benyon MP also patron of Swings & Smiles, guests enjoyed a three course dinner during which they took part in a light hearted general knowledge and pop quiz which saw many guests dancing to the music clues!  
The money raised will go towards setting up our own dedicated centre for our families and a potential new site of the Lower Way pavilion in Thatcham has been identified with a building that would meet our requirements along with outdoor space and in a very accessible location. This represents a significant undertaking and one for which funds raised will help us establish our long term future.

Point of Light Award for Sian Cook

Posted on March 22, 2016March 22, 2016 by Tor Sandars 


Sian is the latest recipient of this award, which recognises outstanding individual volunteers, people who are making a change in their community and inspiring others. Prime Minister David Cameron said: “With Swings & Smiles, Sian has created a fantastic place where families with disabled children can play together in a supported environment. Thanks to her tireless fundraising and commitment, hundreds of families now have indoor and outdoor recreational facilities they can enjoy with other families who understand the additional challenges they face.  To those families, Sian is truly a Point of Light.”

MORE THAN WE BARGAINED FOR!

Posted on April 22, 2016April 22, 2016 by Tor Sandars 


Global FM very generously agreed to donate £24,000 to us so that we can run a separate Outreach programme which means that we can now take our sensory experience to families who can’t get to us. A van and specialist sensory equipment have been bought and additional staff brought in to help carry out the outreach programme which will really help benefit families who need it the most.
What happened next was incredible. Rather than donating £24,000 Global FM gave us a cheque for more than £36,000. We have already agreed to spend the money on the same Outreach programme meaning that we can run it for two years now rather than just one.
We can’t begin to thank Global FM for their wonderful on-going support to us.

Sian commented: “Dan raised a staggering £7,422 and the money he raised will help us continue to support the families who come to Swings & Smiles and also give us the opportunity to reach out and support many more families who benefit from what we can offer. We receive no funding from our local authority and are totally reliant on the generosity of people like Dan. Well done and thank you Dan!”

Super Summer

Posted on September 2, 2016 by Laura Lewis 


We’ve had a great time travelling about in our van, kindly funded by Global Make Some Noise. Swings & Smiles – Out & About has seen us travel around the South of England delivering sensory play sessions in Witney, RAF Benson and Bushey in Hertfordshire.
Our short break sessions have also been popular, we have provided 26 hours of support for families at this sometimes stressful time of year. Children that attended these sessions did so without their parents or siblings and took part in cooking, art and lots of playing.
For the team at Swings & Smiles the summer holidays has been full of super families (new and old), masses of fun and some fabulous memories. We’re already looking forward to next year!

Quiztastic

Posted on September 19, 2016 by Tor Sandars 


It was the first time The Hilton have hosted a quiz at their Newbury North hotel. Sam Farmer, Manager, did a sterling job as compere and the questions were just the right balance for most people on the night!
Our very own Laura Lewis and Sara East and their team members named the ‘Quiztina Aguilera Team’ came first for the second time running.
A total of more than £525 was raised which will go towards equipping our new sensory room at our new site once this is finalised.
Thank You to everyone at The Hilton who made it such a fun evening – yet again! Not to mention the delicious curry and chocolate brownies.

The Power of Pavlova

Posted on October 4, 2016October 4, 2016 by Tor Sandars 


Throughout September, all the proceeds from the sale of Cote’s monthly special dessert of seasonal Pavlova have been donated to Swings & Smiles, A staggering total of £65,759 has been raised through this initiative. Sian Cook, Founder of Swings & Smiles was thrilled when Alex Scrimgeour, CEO of Cote Restaurants, suggested the promotion after hearing about the charity’s need to fund the build of its new facility. At least £450k needs to be raised and so the incredible £65,759 raised throughout all 80 Cote Restaurants will make a significant contribution towards reaching this target. She said: ‘We are overwhelmed by Cote’s generosity. It has been an incredible fundraising initiative and we are so grateful to everyone at Cote and their customers for their kindness and generosity in getting us well and truly on our way to reaching our goal and establishing our long term future.’

A Golfing Triumph

Posted on October 4, 2016 by Tor Sandars 


A huge thanks must go to The Vineyard Group and Donnington Valley Golf Club for hosting our Annual Golf Day on 30th September. 14 teams took to the greens on a beautiful sunny day and fun was had by all. Thanks to the generosity of The Vineyard Group and the participants an amazing £2,500 was raised which will go towards our permanent site for which we are busy fundraising.

The team at The Hilton did us proud yet again and raised over £950 in the process. We are delighted that Roland Gardner and his team came away with the honours of winning as well having the fewest team members on the night – no mean feat! Thank you to everyone at The Hilton for making it such a success and to all those of you who came along on the evening and supported the event.

THE OFFICIAL OPENING

Posted on June 5, 2017June 20, 2017 by Tor Sandars 


Sian Cook said: “We had begun to outgrow the Phoenix Resource Centre and needed more space including outdoor and to be able to increase our opening times. Our potential demand is increasing year on year and the Lower Way building offers a good, secure outdoor space. It’s very important for the children who come to us to be able to enjoy outside play so the new base is perfect for us. Our thanks go to all those companies and individuals who helped us with the move.”
Companies who helped with the move include:
A Brush Above The Rest; Arena Security; Buildbase; Bonkers Play;  Calco; David Wilson Homes; Floorcraft; The Freemasons; Grundon; ITQ; Mercedes; Marshalls Chartered Surveyors; MFG;  Moore Blatch Solicitor;  Opemed; Rapid Clean; Russell Evans Chartered Surveyors; Scofell; Service Master; SpaceKraft; Westronics;
Following the Open Evening, there was a weekend of action-packed fun. Saturday afternoon saw Swings & Smiles host a Harry Potter Themed Grand Opening for all its families with 106 people attending.

We Have Moved House!

We have completed a lease agreement with West Berkshire Council to take over the former Children’s Centre in Lower Way, Thatcham, RG19 3RR.

Founded in 2007, we initially opened at the council’s Phoenix Centre in Newbury in the summer of 2014 to provide a specialist, fully resourced recreational facility for families of children with learning difficulties and disabilities. Since then, over 350 families have registered to play there.  
Sian Cook, Founder of Swings & Smiles said: “This is great news. We had begun to outgrow the Phoenix Resource Centre and needed more space including outdoors and to be able to increase our opening times. Our potential demand is increasing year on year and our longer term aim is to construct and equip a purpose-built facility which meets a much wider need. The A Place To Play building on Lower Way offers a good, secure outdoor space. It’s very important for the children who come to us to be able to enjoy outside play so the new base is perfect for us.”
Lynne Doherty, West Berkshire’s Executive Member for Children and Young People said: “I’m delighted that Swings & Smiles are able to make good use of this building. We are pleased to be able to support this important local charity and that they will be able to continue to progress and grow in their new home.”

Our Vision

Our current facilities and services are available at the times shown on the appropriate page of this site. Operating since the summer of 2014, we are already meeting the needs of a number of families.


We provide an environment where people with special needs and their carers, siblings or the whole family can play together without the pressures often experienced in wider community settings.
Sessions are designed to meet the needs of particular disability groups and age ranges. Provision covers day-time, after-school, weekends and holiday periods.
A range of play settings is available with appropriate equipment, toys and opportunities to try new experiences. We meet a wide range of access and handling requirements and emphasis is placed on the sensory needs of users.
We also welcome adults with disabilities who may benefit and also visits from community groups and respite providers.
Indoors
We include the following facilities:

Sensory room
Soft play area
Arts and crafts
Cookery

As well as toilets with changing facilities.
Outdoors

Open space for play
Garden areas designed for sensory exploration
Inclusive sports and recreation

This area is currently under development and we hope to have more accessible outdoor facilities coming soon. Watch this space.
All these facilities contribute to a range of experiences which can be stimulating or restful as required. They create an environment in which those with special needs and their families can be themselves and grow together.

Our People

Since our foundation and charity registration in 2005, Swings & Smiles has relied on a wealth of voluntary talent – people whose dedication and commitment have seen us to the point we are at today, open for business and meeting an immediate need yet positioned to build on this foundation to meet our longer-term aims. Our ‘volunteer army’ is led by the following:

Patrons






Peter Baker

Peter Baker has already established his own charitable foundation which has the welfare of children in West Berkshire at heart. 'I have been very interested in Swings & Smiles since it was created as its aim is to improve the quality of the lives of families who have a child with special needs. There is no doubt that this comprehensive play facility will benefit many children in the area and I am greatly honoured to be a patron.'







Richard Benyon MP

Richard Benyon has been Member of Parliament for Newbury since 2005. Prior to that, he managed his family business in West Berkshire at Englefield. A former soldier, Richard later became a Chartered Surveyor and was a member of Newbury District Council in the 1990s. He has been active in support of a number of local organisations, including the Citizens Advice Bureau. He was one of the founding Trustees of Help for Heroes.







Mary Cameron

Mary Cameron has been a patron of Swings & Smiles for 6 years. Mary is well respected locally having lived in Peasemore since 1968 with her husband Ian and 4 children: Alex, Tania, David (formerly Prime Minister) and Claire. Sadly, Ian passed away a few years ago. She also has 10 grandchildren who keep her very busy. Mary has led a very full and varied life having been a Justice of the Peace for 30 years, a Church Warden, on the committee of the Newbury Spring Festival since its inception and Deputy Lieutenant of Berkshire. Her main hobby is gardening. She is passionate about Swings & Smiles and understands why it’s so important as her late grandson, Ivan, was born profoundly disabled.







Graeme Murty

Graeme, the former Reading, Southampton and Scotland full back, who is now Head Development Squad Coach at Rangers, is well known for his sense of the importance of community involvement and is actively involved in promoting Swings & Smiles through the local media.

'That Swings & Smiles is going to impact upon the Thames Valley area in such a positive manner reflects fantastically upon those people whose dedication and vision are bringing the dream to fruition. To be asked to be a patron of such a wonderful charity is a source of great pride to me. It is also a reminder that sometimes needing something and campaigning for it is not enough, there are times when direct action is essential. That is why working with Swings & Smiles is so gratifying as those people who saw the need for our facility got up and are making it happen. To work alongside such a focused team is a humbling yet empowering sensation as they strive towards our goal. That is why I could not ignore Swings & Smiles when they asked me to help, I hope they get the same response from thousands more people. They truly deserve huge support and praise.'







Chris Tarrant

Chris Tarrant became a Patron in January 2015 and commented; 'As a Berkshire boy raised and still living in this lovely part of the country, I'm really thrilled to have to become a patron of Swings and Smiles. I think the work they do for kids with special needs and their families in this area is really impressive and I'm looking forward to helping in any way I can.'









Trustees






Sian Cook

Sian has considerable experience of working with local charities and has led several successful campaigns to maintain and improve local provision for disabled children. Sian is a cookery writer and tutor. Her youngest daughter Amy, who is profoundly disabled, was her inspiration for creating Swings & Smiles.







Luisa Godfrey

Luisa is an experienced business leader whose career spans the Defence, Security, Public and Not-for-Profit Sectors. She has held a number of senior management positions and led large multi-disciplinary teams in both the UK and the USA. She is incredibly passionate about helping people to achieve their full potential, and is currently a performance coach with K2. She became involved with Swings and Smiles in the Autumn 2010 and has taken part in a number of fundraising activities for the charity such as the Reading Half Marathon and most recently the Cotswolds Way 100 mile challenge. She became a Trustee at the start of 2015 and volunteers as a play helper at the centre once a month. 







Andrew McKenzie

Andrew is the Managing Director of The Vineyard at Stockcross, Donnington Valley Hotel and Spa, Donnington Valley Golf Club and the independent wine merchant, The Vineyard Cellars. He also oversees the company’s managed hotel business which currently looks after six provincial 4 star hotels under the Sonoma Hotel banner. He is very active in the local community – a former director of West Berkshire Mencap and Corn Exchange Theatre, and is currently a committee member of Newbury Spring Festival fund raising committee and a member of Newbury’s Wharf steering group.







Graham Page

I’m lucky. I don’t have the problems of looking after a family and a SEN child. That’s driven me to support Swings & Smiles and now we are off and running with a great team and some pretty special facilities at The Phoenix Resource Centre. A new purpose-built facility is still our goal and we will make this happen; trust us. Our SEN children and families are special to us – please help if you can.







Helen Waring

Helen has worked in the design industry for over 30 years and is a director of Cream Design who specialise in corporate identity, literature and digital design for large and small businesses, charities and organisations.







Julie Whittington

Julie has over 10 years IT experience in the Telecommunications industry, and more recently became a self-employed IT Project Manager. She has managed and led a number of key initiatives, projects and teams to deliver company’s objectives. Julie has two young children and during her ‘time off’ from full-time working she is very involved with Swings & Smiles. She became a trustee in May 2012.

Tom Searby

Tom is a design consultant and qualified Architect at Sutton Griffin Architects, with a broad range of experience in both commercial and private residential projects.

Be part of an environment where the self esteem, health, confidence and social skills of children with special needs (0-19yrs) and their siblings can be increased through accessible play and recreation.
Be part of a service that provides parents with an opportunity to meet others who have children with special needs, to lessen their isolation and to increase their ability to support their children through play.

Welcome

Everyone at Swings & Smiles understands just how different life is when you are living in a family where a brother or sister has a disability or special needs.


We appreciate how Siblings like yourselves are often known to be caring, sympathetic to others, and mature for your age. We also know that you are likely to be affected in a number of ways by your brother’s or sister’s disability or special needs. For instance, you may feel you receive less attention from your parents or maybe you are bullied at school because of your particular situation.
At Swings & Smiles we understand the emotions you may struggle with and want you to know that you are important too.

Some Facts And Figures
In the UK, there are 770,000 disabled children under the age of 16. That equates to one child in 20.
Only 16% of mothers with disabled children work, compared to 61% of other mothers.
It costs up to three times as much to raise a disabled child, as it does to raise a child without disabilities.
Caring for a disabled child can cause relationship problems. According to one study, 31% of couples report some problems, 13% cite major problems and 9% actually separate. Stress, depression and lack of sleep are other commonly experienced problems.

Double Donation from DoubleTree

We had a wonderful surprise last week when a team from Double Tree by Hilton Newbury North arrived to present us with a cheque.


We received an amazing donation of £1,474 which was the money raised from the past two quiz evenings – both of which were great fun and a huge success.
Watch this space for another quiz later this year.

			Tor Sandars, 6 June 2017		












THE OFFICIAL OPENING

On Friday 19th May we officially opened our play facility for families with special needs children at A Place to Play, Lower Way Thatcham. The opening event was attended by many long-standing supporters as well as representatives from local businesses, a lot of whom gave up their time free of charge to help us with our move.


Sian Cook said: “We had begun to outgrow the Phoenix Resource Centre and needed more space including outdoor and to be able to increase our opening times. Our potential demand is increasing year on year and the Lower Way building offers a good, secure outdoor space. It’s very important for the children who come to us to be able to enjoy outside play so the new base is perfect for us. Our thanks go to all those companies and individuals who helped us with the move.”
Companies who helped with the move include:
A Brush Above The Rest; Arena Security; Buildbase; Bonkers Play;  Calco; David Wilson Homes; Floorcraft; The Freemasons; Grundon; ITQ; Mercedes; Marshalls Chartered Surveyors; MFG;  Moore Blatch Solicitor;  Opemed; Rapid Clean; Russell Evans Chartered Surveyors; Scofell; Service Master; SpaceKraft; Westronics;
Following the Open Evening, there was a weekend of action-packed fun. Saturday afternoon saw Swings & Smiles host a Harry Potter Themed Grand Opening for all its families with 106 people attending. 

			Tor Sandars, 5 June 2017		












MAY FAIR SUCCESS

On 30th April the Royal Oak in Ecchinswell hosted the village May Fair for the 4th consecutive year. The event was a great success and drew in crowds from far and wide. There was a host of different activities on offer and everyone had a fantastic time. Fortunately, the rain held off all day.


The event raised an amazing £2,500 for us and we are extremely grateful to Chris and Laura from the Royal Oak, along with all the Committee members, who worked so hard to make this such a success. It is thanks to support like this that we can continue to provide our invaluable service for families with special needs children. Thank You.

			Tor Sandars, 5 June 2017		












Curry & Quiz Success

The Hilton Newbury North hosted yet another wonderful quiz night


The team at The Hilton did us proud yet again and raised over £950 in the process. We are delighted that Roland Gardner and his team came away with the honours of winning as well having the fewest team members on the night – no mean feat! Thank you to everyone at The Hilton for making it such a success and to all those of you who came along on the evening and supported the event. 

			Tor Sandars, 21 February 2017		












Candlelight Carols

Swings & Smiles’ annual Candlelight Carol Service took place at St Mark’s Church in Englefield on Thursday 8th December.
 


The event was attended by patrons Chris Tarrant OBE, Mary Cameron and Richard Benyon MP. Victoria Fishburn, High Sheriff of Berkshire and Allen Sinclair from the BBC were also in attendance and gave readings.
It was a wonderful occasion with Swings & Smiles children providing some of the music as well as Englefield Primary School Choir.

			Tor Sandars, 12 December 2016		












A Golfing Triumph

Donnington Valley Golf Club Host our Annual Golf Day


A huge thanks must go to The Vineyard Group and Donnington Valley Golf Club for hosting our Annual Golf Day on 30th September. 14 teams took to the greens on a beautiful sunny day and fun was had by all. Thanks to the generosity of The Vineyard Group and the participants an amazing £2,500 was raised which will go towards our permanent site for which we are busy fundraising. 

			Tor Sandars, 4 October 2016		












The Power of Pavlova

Cote Restaurants donate an amazing £65,759 through sales of pavlova


Throughout September, all the proceeds from the sale of Cote’s monthly special dessert of seasonal Pavlova have been donated to Swings & Smiles, A staggering total of £65,759 has been raised through this initiative. Sian Cook, Founder of Swings & Smiles was thrilled when Alex Scrimgeour, CEO of Cote Restaurants, suggested the promotion after hearing about the charity’s need to fund the build of its new facility. At least £450k needs to be raised and so the incredible £65,759 raised throughout all 80 Cote Restaurants will make a significant contribution towards reaching this target. She said: ‘We are overwhelmed by Cote’s generosity. It has been an incredible fundraising initiative and we are so grateful to everyone at Cote and their customers for their kindness and generosity in getting us well and truly on our way to reaching our goal and establishing our long term future.’

			Tor Sandars, 4 October 2016		












Quiztastic

The Hilton Newbury North came up trumps yet again with the hosting of a fantastic quiz night.


It was the first time The Hilton have hosted a quiz at their Newbury North hotel. Sam Farmer, Manager, did a sterling job as compere and the questions were just the right balance for most people on the night!
Our very own Laura Lewis and Sara East and their team members named the ‘Quiztina Aguilera Team’ came first for the second time running.
A total of more than £525 was raised which will go towards equipping our new sensory room at our new site once this is finalised.
Thank You to everyone at The Hilton who made it such a fun evening – yet again! Not to mention the delicious curry and chocolate brownies.

			Tor Sandars, 19 September 2016		












Super Summer

The six week holidays have flown past at Swings & Smiles with us offering short breaks, outreach sessions and lots of family play at the centre.


We’ve had a great time travelling about in our van, kindly funded by Global Make Some Noise. Swings & Smiles – Out & About has seen us travel around the South of England delivering sensory play sessions in Witney, RAF Benson and Bushey in Hertfordshire.
Our short break sessions have also been popular, we have provided 26 hours of support for families at this sometimes stressful time of year. Children that attended these sessions did so without their parents or siblings and took part in cooking, art and lots of playing.
For the team at Swings & Smiles the summer holidays has been full of super families (new and old), masses of fun and some fabulous memories. We’re already looking forward to next year!

			Laura Lewis, 2 September 2016		












RUNNING FOR SWINGS & SMILES

Last month, Daniel Reeves, took part in a gruelling challenge to raise money for Swings & Smiles. He undertook the ultimate test of stamina by competing in the Marathon Des Sables. In total, he ran 4 marathons and one ultra marathon in six days in the blistering heat of the Sahara Desert.
 


Sian commented: “Dan raised a staggering £7,422 and the money he raised will help us continue to support the families who come to Swings & Smiles and also give us the opportunity to reach out and support many more families who benefit from what we can offer. We receive no funding from our local authority and are totally reliant on the generosity of people like Dan. Well done and thank you Dan!”

			Tor Sandars, 3 May 2016

Overview

Swings & Smiles have been working tirelessly for the past few years to bring families with special needs children an environment where they can all play together – something most families take for granted.


Based at Lower Way in Thatcham we are delighted to bring you this opportunity and we do hope that your experience with us meets all your expectations.
With our own purpose built soft play room and other exclusive activities we are now able to provide you with much needed recreational facilities and services of a kind which aren’t currently available within 40 miles of Newbury.

What’s On Offer

We are able to offer specialist play resources to enable children with a wide range of disabilities to play with siblings and other family members in a secure and safe environment with appropriate services and equipment available.



Sensory Room
This room offers vital sensory equipment to alert movement, sight, sound and smell – critical senses when communication is poor. The room can be used as a quiet contemplative area, with opportunities for siblings and parents to create sensory experiences.







Activity Area
The activity area offers opportunities for themed art, cooking or sensory based play. These sessions are planned with the specific needs of the children attending in mind so are adapted on a session by session basis.







Soft Play
These areas offer an exciting range of play activities including a soft play area with a soft play den; balance beam; interactive ballpool and a musical piano keyboard floor mat to name but a few. Throughout this room there are a wide range of activities on offer that are suitable for both special needs children and their siblings.







Play Zone
This space is full of toys and fun activities to take part in.  As with the activity area, we adapt the toys and equipment that we have available to suit the age and developmental needs of the children attending and their siblings.







Outdoors
We have a large outdoor area available which comprises a large playground for letting off steam as well as a smaller quiet garden with slide, bike track and gardening area. You will find messy play out here as well as other themed outdoor fun and games. This area is still under development and we are soon hoping to have swings to suit all abilities as well as other accessible equipment.

Meet The Team

Swings & Smiles has a fantastic and experienced team who are here to ensure that when you visit us you have a really great time. Once you have been welcomed by the reception team, the play leaders have planned some super activities. The play leaders are trained to help you use our equipment and are also on hand to provide support, however it is needed, so that the whole family can enjoy playing at Swings & Smiles. We are really looking forward to meeting you.

 
Meet The Team






Laura Lewis
Manager
Laura has worked for over 10 years supporting families and children in the Newbury area and has set up many services where playing as a family together is the priority. As the manager of Swings & Smiles at the Phoenix Resource Centre Laura is passionate that all children and families who walk through the doors have a fun and fulfilling experience in a warm and welcoming environment. Laura has 4 children and in her spare time goes running and then eats biscuits. When at work she can be found relaxing in the Sensory Room.







Sara East

Sara is both a receptionist and finance officer for Swings & Smiles and really enjoys meeting the many lovely children and families who come and play.  Sara has previously worked in the travel industry and now works with her husband for their decorating business.  Sara has 2 children and has recently learnt all of the words to the film Frozen.  She loves nights at the theatre and sunny holidays.  If she’s not at the reception desk you may find Sara drumming away in the Music Room.







Jeannie Garrett

As one of the play leaders Jeannie is always ready to support children and families to get the most out of their visit at Swings & Smiles and is also part of our sibling support team. Jeannie has previously supported adults with disabilities to live in their own homes and is now a learning support assistant at a local primary school. In her spare time Jeannie is a keen tennis player and Disney fanatic. Jeannie is most likely to be found on the Tracked Slide.







Pippa Graham

Pippa has worked with children with special needs for a number of years and is currently working at the Castle school.  Pippa is a play leader with Swings & Smiles and is responsible for all of the wonderful cookery activities that take place.  Away from work Pippa spends a lot of time outdoors with her two horses and Harvey the dog. Pippa is quite accident prone, enjoys early mornings and trips to the seaside with her horse. If you ever lose Pippa you are most likely to find her at the bottom of the ball pool in the Soft Play Room.







Adele Udry

Adele is one of our play leaders and has worked for many years in various care settings, including supporting adults with learning disabilities to live in the community.  Adele will mainly be found working at Lego Club and at all of our weekend sessions, she is a fantastic bacon roll maker so be sure to pop in one Sunday morning to see for yourself.  Outside of work Adele enjoys trips to the gym, spending time with her family and walking her bouncy dog.  If Adele goes missing whilst at work check out the Den where she'll probably be playing Minecraft on the Xbox.

Our Families

Since opening our doors for the first time in June 2014 we have gone from strength to strength. Over 350 families have registered to play at our facility at Swings & Smiles. We are delighted to be able to provide a specialist, fully resourced recreational play facility for families of children with learning difficulties and disabilities.


Meet Katie
When Katie was born in the summer of 2006 we had a diagnosis regarding her visual impairment within 2 weeks. She had a diagnosis of micropthalmia (small eyes), retinal coloboma (a wedge of retina is missing from both eyes) and rotational nystagmus.
Over the next year it was obvious that Katie did in fact have more far significant problems than at first thought. We entered into an unknown world of hospital tests and investigations to try and determine what was wrong and whether there was a diagnosis. Eventually, after a lot of time and effort, Katie was diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome. This means that Katie has both physical and cognitive difficulties making everyday life a real challenge for her and the rest of the family.
However, since visiting Swings & Smiles we have seen Katie explore and develop more and more independence. Apart from at home and school, this is the only place that she can do this. Katie started off coming in her walker and needing a lot of assistance to move around the building. Now she free walks and is so speedy she disappears down the corridors and knows how to use the lift! She climbs into the ball pit on her own and takes herself off to the slide.
What is just as important for us is that her older brother William, aged 9, has also got to know people and make friends at Swings & Smiles. He and Katie both get equal attention and he knows that everyone wants to be his friend too which is really important to him. As a family of six, Katie and William have an older brother and sister too, we all enjoy coming to Swings & Smiles for family play but also special events such as Katie’s birthday, Halloween and regular music therapy sessions.
Meeting other parents is great fun as well as getting to know the lovely, fun Swings & Smiles team – being here is like a breath of fresh air and I don’t know what we would do without it.
Rhonda Nicklin,

Meet Eddie
When I fell pregnant for the third time we were extremely excited about the new arrival. Everything had gone smoothly
during my pregnancy and, with a healthy boy and girl in the family, we had no reason to think that Eddie would be any different.
However, the delivery proved very tricky and Eddie was born traumatised and taken immediately to special care where he stayed for a month. We were then told that, as a result of the problems during the delivery, Eddie was showing signs of having been affected by this. He was born with very low muscle tone, poor kidneys and unable to feed, meaning he had to be fed by tube for quite some time.
Eddie is now 16 years old and we really have had to take each day at a time. The tiredness takes over along with the lack of having any control over your own life – there is no such thing as a straightforward day. The most difficult things I have had to
deal with have been the numerous hospital operations Eddie has had to have and we’ve found that the only way to cope is to depersonalise it when it comes to decision making to make sure we do what’s best for him. Our two older children have found it very difficult to deal with and although they were old enough to understand what was going on they didn’t appreciate the complexities.
Eddie loves coming to Swings & Smiles and gets very excited about going on the slide and in the ball pit. He really enjoys being with both older and younger people and gets real benefits from the social interaction.  As a mum with an older child with special needs I have got real pleasure from having the knowledge to pass onto other parents who have younger children and I feel like I have achieved something by being able to offer them advice and help. They then hopefully feel that they are not on their own.
Everyone loves the quirks of the children who come to Swings & Smiles – it’s a real family with no segregation and we know that we are all in this together.

Meet Georgia
When Georgia was born in 2011, I had 30 blissful worry free minutes as I cradled my perfect baby daughter in my arms before I entered a world of huge uncertainty and anxiety. With a larger than average head, Georgia was immediately taken for tests and so we entered a world of regular hospital visits.
Over the next couple of years more and more problems became apparent as she was diagnosed with a very rare problem with her eyes and a kidney condition. An MRI scan detected brain abnormalities and, on top of these, it was clear that her development was delayed.
Within a very short period of time we had to come to terms with the fact that Georgia clearly had significant problems and we found ourselves in a position that we were completely unprepared for. With no specific diagnosis, there were no support groups available to us. So, as her mother and being with her 24 hours a day, I found myself increasingly shutting myself at home with Georgia not wanting to face the outside world. On occasion, I did brave the local mother and baby groups but found myself
wanting to just run away from them and burst into tears. The stark contrast between Georgia and the other children was very apparent and other parents were staring and, without meaning to, passing judgement. I just couldn’t find anywhere where we felt comfortable as a family.
When we heard about Swings & Smiles we were one of the first families to visit them when they opened at The Phoenix Resource Centre. It was such a relief to be able to take Georgia and her 8 year old half sister, Issy, somewhere they could play together in an environment that was suitable for both of them. We found ourselves able to be a ‘normal’ family without worrying about what other people were thinking and being self conscious – which is how we had always felt previously. We have got to meet families who are in similar situations to us and, as a result, feel less isolated.
We are now regular visitors to Swings & Smiles and it has transformed our ability to play as a family. Georgia, Issy and their new friends enjoy all of what’s on offer at Swings & Smiles and, in particular, the messy play sessions!

Meet Olivia
My husband Lucio and I were delighted when we discovered that I was pregnant with our first child. However, during the pregnancy it became apparent that there were problems and we were then given the shattering news that our unborn baby had
a chromosome abnormality.
There could be no certainty of what would be wrong and to what degree but we
decided to go-ahead with the pregnancy and just prayed that we would be able to give our child a good quality of life.
Olivia was born in July 2001 and it was soon apparent that she had global developmental delay. She took her first steps at the age of six and spoke her first word aged 6½ years. She has a sensory fear of the unknown and has fixations rather than an interest in typical play. It has been a long journey for us. We have two other children, Gianni (aged 10) and Santino (aged 9), both of whom love their sister.
One of the hardest things for us has been the inability to let Olivia go anywhere. She has no sense of danger, her balance
is poor and despite trying numerous social activities none of them have worked. We even found ourselves taking Olivia to a Car Wash as an activity because she really enjoys watching the car being washed – not a typical play activity for a 13 year old girl! When you don’t have a special needs child one of the things you probably don’t appreciate is that special needs children often have no friends, they are not invited to birthday parties and it is a heartbreaking journey seeing your child in this position.
We were very concerned about bringing Olivia to Swings & Smiles for the first time as we were afraid that another social
opportunity for her would end in failure and more despair for us as a family. The first time Olivia visited Swings & Smiles she was incredibly nervous of her surroundings. However, as time went on she became more and more at ease. Swings & Smiles has proved to be a completely new experience for us as a family. Olivia has flourished since coming to play here and often the first thing she says when she gets back from school is ‘I want to go to Swings & Smiles,’ – a first for us and a happy one!
After 13 long years we have finally found somewhere we can play as a whole family. I can take Olivia’s food for her as she needs specially prepared food and there is a kitchen we can use. It isn’t too noisy for her, there is no staring and we all feel very comfortable as soon as we walk through the doors.
Her brothers love it at Swings & Smiles – there is no DS or Minecraft just good old-fashioned play where they can all just mess around together with none of us worrying about what other people think or say because everyone is in a similar position to us.
Kim Falino,
 mother to Olivia

Double Donation from DoubleTree

We had a wonderful surprise last week when a team from Double Tree by Hilton Newbury North arrived to present us with a cheque.


We received an amazing donation of £1,474 which was the money raised from the past two quiz evenings – both of which were great fun and a huge success.
Watch this space for another quiz later this year.

THE OFFICIAL OPENING

On Friday 19th May we officially opened our play facility for families with special needs children at A Place to Play, Lower Way Thatcham. The opening event was attended by many long-standing supporters as well as representatives from local businesses, a lot of whom gave up their time free of charge to help us with our move.


Sian Cook said: “We had begun to outgrow the Phoenix Resource Centre and needed more space including outdoor and to be able to increase our opening times. Our potential demand is increasing year on year and the Lower Way building offers a good, secure outdoor space. It’s very important for the children who come to us to be able to enjoy outside play so the new base is perfect for us. Our thanks go to all those companies and individuals who helped us with the move.”
Companies who helped with the move include:
A Brush Above The Rest; Arena Security; Buildbase; Bonkers Play;  Calco; David Wilson Homes; Floorcraft; The Freemasons; Grundon; ITQ; Mercedes; Marshalls Chartered Surveyors; MFG;  Moore Blatch Solicitor;  Opemed; Rapid Clean; Russell Evans Chartered Surveyors; Scofell; Service Master; SpaceKraft; Westronics;
Following the Open Evening, there was a weekend of action-packed fun. Saturday afternoon saw Swings & Smiles host a Harry Potter Themed Grand Opening for all its families with 106 people attending.

MAY FAIR SUCCESS

On 30th April the Royal Oak in Ecchinswell hosted the village May Fair for the 4th consecutive year. The event was a great success and drew in crowds from far and wide. There was a host of different activities on offer and everyone had a fantastic time. Fortunately, the rain held off all day.


The event raised an amazing £2,500 for us and we are extremely grateful to Chris and Laura from the Royal Oak, along with all the Committee members, who worked so hard to make this such a success. It is thanks to support like this that we can continue to provide our invaluable service for families with special needs children. Thank You.

Curry & Quiz Success

The Hilton Newbury North hosted yet another wonderful quiz night


The team at The Hilton did us proud yet again and raised over £950 in the process. We are delighted that Roland Gardner and his team came away with the honours of winning as well having the fewest team members on the night – no mean feat! Thank you to everyone at The Hilton for making it such a success and to all those of you who came along on the evening and supported the event.

Candlelight Carols

Swings & Smiles’ annual Candlelight Carol Service took place at St Mark’s Church in Englefield on Thursday 8th December.
 


The event was attended by patrons Chris Tarrant OBE, Mary Cameron and Richard Benyon MP. Victoria Fishburn, High Sheriff of Berkshire and Allen Sinclair from the BBC were also in attendance and gave readings.
It was a wonderful occasion with Swings & Smiles children providing some of the music as well as Englefield Primary School Choir.

A Golfing Triumph

Donnington Valley Golf Club Host our Annual Golf Day


A huge thanks must go to The Vineyard Group and Donnington Valley Golf Club for hosting our Annual Golf Day on 30th September. 14 teams took to the greens on a beautiful sunny day and fun was had by all. Thanks to the generosity of The Vineyard Group and the participants an amazing £2,500 was raised which will go towards our permanent site for which we are busy fundraising.

The Power of Pavlova

Cote Restaurants donate an amazing £65,759 through sales of pavlova


Throughout September, all the proceeds from the sale of Cote’s monthly special dessert of seasonal Pavlova have been donated to Swings & Smiles, A staggering total of £65,759 has been raised through this initiative. Sian Cook, Founder of Swings & Smiles was thrilled when Alex Scrimgeour, CEO of Cote Restaurants, suggested the promotion after hearing about the charity’s need to fund the build of its new facility. At least £450k needs to be raised and so the incredible £65,759 raised throughout all 80 Cote Restaurants will make a significant contribution towards reaching this target. She said: ‘We are overwhelmed by Cote’s generosity. It has been an incredible fundraising initiative and we are so grateful to everyone at Cote and their customers for their kindness and generosity in getting us well and truly on our way to reaching our goal and establishing our long term future.’

Quiztastic

The Hilton Newbury North came up trumps yet again with the hosting of a fantastic quiz night.


It was the first time The Hilton have hosted a quiz at their Newbury North hotel. Sam Farmer, Manager, did a sterling job as compere and the questions were just the right balance for most people on the night!
Our very own Laura Lewis and Sara East and their team members named the ‘Quiztina Aguilera Team’ came first for the second time running.
A total of more than £525 was raised which will go towards equipping our new sensory room at our new site once this is finalised.
Thank You to everyone at The Hilton who made it such a fun evening – yet again! Not to mention the delicious curry and chocolate brownies.

Super Summer

The six week holidays have flown past at Swings & Smiles with us offering short breaks, outreach sessions and lots of family play at the centre.


We’ve had a great time travelling about in our van, kindly funded by Global Make Some Noise. Swings & Smiles – Out & About has seen us travel around the South of England delivering sensory play sessions in Witney, RAF Benson and Bushey in Hertfordshire.
Our short break sessions have also been popular, we have provided 26 hours of support for families at this sometimes stressful time of year. Children that attended these sessions did so without their parents or siblings and took part in cooking, art and lots of playing.
For the team at Swings & Smiles the summer holidays has been full of super families (new and old), masses of fun and some fabulous memories. We’re already looking forward to next year!

RUNNING FOR SWINGS & SMILES

Last month, Daniel Reeves, took part in a gruelling challenge to raise money for Swings & Smiles. He undertook the ultimate test of stamina by competing in the Marathon Des Sables. In total, he ran 4 marathons and one ultra marathon in six days in the blistering heat of the Sahara Desert.
 


Sian commented: “Dan raised a staggering £7,422 and the money he raised will help us continue to support the families who come to Swings & Smiles and also give us the opportunity to reach out and support many more families who benefit from what we can offer. We receive no funding from our local authority and are totally reliant on the generosity of people like Dan. Well done and thank you Dan!”
