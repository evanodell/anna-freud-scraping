404 - PAGE NOT FOUND











ERROR 404 - PAGE NOT FOUND



Why am I seeing this page?

404 means the file is not found. If you have already uploaded the file then the name may be misspelled or it is in a different folder.
Other Possible Causes
You may get a 404 error for images because you have Hot Link Protection turned on and the domain is not on the list of authorized domains.
If you go to your temporary url (http://ip/~username/) and get this error, there maybe a problem with the rule set stored in an .htaccess file. You can try renaming that file to .htaccess-backup and refreshing the site to see if that resolves the issue.
It is also possible that you have inadvertently deleted your document root or the your account may need to be recreated. Either way, please contact your web host immediately.
Are you using WordPress? See the Section on 404 errors after clicking a link in WordPress.



How to find the correct spelling and folder

Missing or Broken Files
When you get a 404 error be sure to check the URL that you are attempting to use in your browser.This tells the server what resource it should attempt to request.
http://example.com/example/Example/help.html
In this example the file must be in public_html/example/Example/
Notice that the CaSe is important in this example. On platforms that enforce case-sensitivity example and Example are not the same locations.
For addon domains, the file must be in public_html/addondomain.com/example/Example/ and the names are case-sensitive.
Broken Image
When you have a missing image on your site you may see a box on your page with with a red X where the image is missing. Right click on the X and choose Properties. The properties will tell you the path and file name that cannot be found.
This varies by browser, if you do not see a box on your page with a red X try right clicking on the page, then select View Page Info, and goto the Media Tab.
http://example.com/cgi-sys/images/banner.PNG
In this example the image file must be in public_html/cgi-sys/images/
Notice that the CaSe is important in this example. On platforms that enforce case-sensitivity PNG and png are not the same locations.



404 Errors After Clicking WordPress Links

When working with WordPress, 404 Page Not Found errors can often occur when a new theme has been activated or when the rewrite rules in the .htaccess file have been altered.
When you encounter a 404 error in WordPress, you have two options for correcting it.
Option 1: Correct the Permalinks

Log in to WordPress.
From the left-hand navigation menu in WordPress, click Settings > Permalinks (Note the current setting. If you are using a custom structure, copy or save the custom structure somewhere.)
Select  Default.
Click Save Settings.
Change the settings back to the previous configuration (before you selected Default). Put the custom structure back if you had one.
Click Save Settings.

This will reset the permalinks and fix the issue in many cases. If this doesn't work, you may need to edit your .htaccess file directly.
Option 2: Modify the .htaccess File
Add the following snippet of code to the top of your .htaccess file:


										# BEGIN WordPress
										<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
										RewriteEngine On
										RewriteBase /
										RewriteRule ^index.php$ - [L]
										RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
										RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
										RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
										</IfModule>
										# End WordPress
									

If your blog is showing the wrong domain name in links, redirecting to another site, or is missing images and style, these are all usually related to the same problem: you have the wrong domain name configured in your WordPress blog.



How to modify your .htaccess file

The .htaccess file contains directives (instructions) that tell the server how to behave in certain scenarios and directly affect how your website functions.
Redirects and rewriting URLs are two very common directives found in a .htaccess file, and many scripts such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and Magento add directives to the .htaccess so those scripts can function.
It is possible that you may need to edit the .htaccess file at some point, for various reasons.This section covers how to edit the file in cPanel, but not what may need to be changed.(You may need to consult other articles and resources for that information.)
There are Many Ways to Edit a .htaccess File

Edit the file on your computer and upload it to the server via FTP
Use an FTP program's Edit Mode
Use SSH and a text editor
Use the File Manager in cPanel

The easiest way to edit a .htaccess file for most people is through the File Manager in cPanel.
How to Edit .htaccess files in cPanel's File Manager
Before you do anything, it is suggested that you backup your website so that you can revert back to a previous version if something goes wrong.
Open the File Manager

Log into cPanel.
In the Files section, click on the File Manager icon.
Check the box for Document Root for and select the domain name you wish to access from the drop-down menu.
Make sure Show Hidden Files (dotfiles)" is checked.
Click Go. The File Manager will open in a new tab or window.
Look for the .htaccess file in the list of files. You may need to scroll to find it.

To Edit the .htaccess File

Right click on the .htaccess file and click Code Edit from the menu. Alternatively, you can click on the icon for the .htaccess file and then click on the Code Editor icon at the top of the page.
A dialogue box may appear asking you about encoding. Just click Edit to continue. The editor will open in a new window.
Edit the file as needed.
Click Save Changes in the upper right hand corner when done. The changes will be saved.
Test your website to make sure your changes were successfully saved. If not, correct the error or revert back to the previous version until your site works again.
Once complete, you can click Close to close the File Manager window.

Counselling and psychotherapy - they seem to have negative connotations and be looked down on for some reason – but we’re here to change this!

What we do





STAMP


What is STAMP?
STAMP is the young people’s panel of Right Here, coordinated by Laura Abbott and Chantelle Parke from Chilypep (Children & Young People’s Empowerment Project). STAMP have been helping to steer the project since the start, as well as gaining the voice of young people around mental health. STAMP were involved in identifying mental health as a key issue for young people, writing the project bid, and interviewing and employing workers for the project. They have helped design and develop the therapeutic group work activities that the emotional well being workers deliver to young people across Sheffield, and have also been involved in planning delivery and strategic aims on an annual basis. STAMP get together once a week to work together to campaign for change around the mental health and emotional wellbeing of other young people.
 
STAMP Out Stigma!
We also work on our own projects, including our campaign ‘STAMP out stigma’. As part of this we have raised awareness amongst other young people about mental health and carried out peer research around mental health and stigma. We designed and produced our own board game ‘Dare you Share?’ which is based on a theme park to show the ups and downs young people experience. The game aims to promote discussion around mental health in a fun and interactive way and is being used by youth groups and schools in Sheffield and in some other areas of the UK. We also designed and produced anti-stigma postcards with the slogans ‘Mental Health is a part of you, not apart from you’ and ‘What is normal anyway?’


































If you would like to trial ‘Dare you Share?’ with your school or youth group then please get in touch to request a copy!
 
Improving mental health services for young people!
We really want to improve mental health services and support for young people aged 16-25. We are working with CAMHS (Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services) in Sheffield to implement the Department of Health’s ‘You’re Welcome’ standards to make CAMHS more young people friendly. We have all been trained to be young evaluators and have been carrying out inspections into CAMHS.
We’re also working with IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) in Sheffield to look at the experiences that young people have had around accessing support in order to improve this service so that it meets the needs of young people. This will also mean working with professionals across the City to promote the service and working with IAPT staff to help them be able to better support young people.
 
Have a voice and a choice in your mental health!
Soon we will be carrying out focus groups with young people across the City to find out what the main issues for young people are, and what mental health support they feel they need. This will be collated into a manifesto which will be central to our campaign looking at Stamping out stigma and improving mental health support for young people across the City and hopefully across the UK too.
 
How to get involved / how to join STAMP
Whether you are a professional that would like to speak to us about young people’s mental health and mental health services, or a young person who would like to feed in your views and experiences then we would love to hear from you! We are always looking for new members aged 16-25 who are passionate about mental health for young people and want to make a difference!

Often young people turn to their friends for help, or it’s friends who notice that someone seems to be stressed or struggling.
It’s for these reasons the Children’s Hospital Charity funded a project with the CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) Team in Sheffield, part of the Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust to develop a website to help young people help their friends they think may have mental health problems. (Of course, young people can use the site to find out about difficulties they’re experiencing, and parents, teachers and others can also use it for information and advice).

What is mental health?



































Contact Us
What we do





What is mental health?


Mental health is something that we all have. Some people call mental health ‘emotional health’ or ‘well being’ and it’s just as important as good physical health.
According to the Mental Health Foundation (one of our funders):
Being mentally healthy doesn’t just mean that you don’t have mental health problems
If you’re in good mental health you can:

Make the most of your potential
Cope with life
Play a full part in your family, workplace, community and among friends

Mental health is everyone’s business. We all have times when we feel down or stressed and frightened. Most of the time those feelings pass. But sometimes they develop into a more serious problem and that could happen to any one of us.
Everyone is different. You may bounce back from a setback while someone else may feel weighed down by it for a long time. It’s important to remember that your mental health doesn’t always stay the same. It can change as circumstances change and as you move through different stages of your life.
Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to mental health problems. This means that people feel uncomfortable about them and don’t talk about them much. Many people don’t even feel comfortable talking about their feelings. But it’s healthy to know and say how you’re feeling.
We are working with young people to help them start to think about their emotional well being and to begin to talk about mental health and how they feel. Our activities are also aimed at helping to improve young peoples self esteem, confidence and resilience.
WHAT IS RESILIENCE?
Resilience is our ability to cope with life’s problems and setbacks and tackle them head on. If we have good resilience we are more able to quickly bounce back from difficult times. For those of us who lack resilience, life’s problems can sometimes become overwhelming and leave us feeling distressed and unable to cope. The good news is that we can all learn new skills to become more resilient. The activities we run are aimed at helping you to develop better resilience. We have lots of top tips to help you look after your mental health and emotional well being.

Activities


Mental Health Ambassadors
Right Here Sheffield works with a group of young people, some who have experienced mental health problems, to support the work of the project with their peers. They encourage mental health awareness and coping strategies; promote the project with information stalls; support emotional well being workers delivering projects and involve themselves in relevant opportunities as they arise.
They act as advocates and role models for other young people in the city.
We have a group of between 10 and 12 ambassadors trained up at any time supporting the work of Right Here with their peers. They gain confidence and skills to build their own resilience and to advocate this to others.

Building Bridges
The ‘Building Bridges to Employment’ programme intends to support the emotional wellbeing of young people not in education, employment or training. We focus on developing self awareness, self-esteem, confidence and motivation to advance the journey into work.
We create an environment where young people feel valued, their contribution encouraged and seen as useful for the whole group’s progress.
 
Cage the Rage
Cage the Rage is a experiential therapeutic group which allows young people to really explore the root causes of their anger. It also gives young people the coping skills to cope with their anger. We engage young people in this work through the use of  creative techniques, games, role playing and strategies in how to support themselves and each other within the group.
We know from previous evaluations of our activities that young people really value the opportunity to share feelings and thoughts around issues of mental health and well being and we create space for young people to do this.
The facilitators are trained counsellors and therapists who have worked with young people in group settings and on a 1:1 basis. They are therefore experienced in understanding complex needs and issues that young people face. The space will be supportive and sensitive to the needs of young people allowing time for expression and discussion.
We create an environment where young people feel valued, their contribution encouraged and seen as useful for the whole group’s progress.
Y-Act
Y-Act is a user group for the Interchange CIC Counselling Service and Sheffield Right Here and it meets once a month to look at ways of improving mental health services for young people in the city. Last year the group worked with local artist Vicky Morris to write poems and conduct interviews about their use of services.  The work can be seen here and shows a real understanding of what young people aged 16 – 25 need to support their emotional wellbeing and mental health and we plan to reproduce this in Right Here’s final report for commissioners and key decision makers in Sheffield.
This year we have a new group of young people who have done some team building activities and wish to become a fund raising and awareness raising team for the Interchange Counselling Service.  The group will also be contributing to this website – so watch this space.

You have a right to feel alright
by admin on September 13, 2011


What does mental health mean to you? For many young people the phrase is meaningless, and as much as ones physical health is looked after, the same cannot be said for their mental health.
So what is mental health? The way you behave, and the way you feel are all down to your mental health. Whether you feel happy, bored, or sad, it is due to your mental health. When you feel good about yourself you don’t really pay attention to your mental health, however when you feel low and negative about yourself you tend to think about it more.
If you feel down, lonely, or sad for a prolonged period of time, you do not have to put up with it. You don’t deserve to feel this way. There are places for you to go, things that you can do to make yourself feel better. Just as we are all prone to catching a cough or a cold, we are also prone to experiencing some sort of emotional distress.
Feeling as if you need to talk to somebody about your feelings, is not something to be embarrassed about. Think about it as taking medicine for your mind, its the sensible thing to do when you have too much on your plate. There is no short supply to the places you can go for help, a place that I have found of great use in times of need is the Interchange Counselling service.
During a time in which I felt like I needed extra support I turned to a professional. Over approximately a two month period I attended weekly sessions at the Interchange Counselling service. It wasn’t like any of the counselling sessions I had experienced before, where I never felt like I had truly explored my thoughts and feelings. During my first session, I rated myself on a scale of one to ten for various things such as thinking positively, self esteem etc. Throughout my experience at the Interchange I was talked to as an equal, and my counsellor helped me realise where my issues lay. I had been told time and time again what was wrong with me, but at the Interchange I saw it for myself, which in turn helped me to help myself. At the end of my time at the Interchange, I rated myself on my self esteem and positive thinking yet again. I had drastically improved, and I was in shock at how low I had ranked myself before.
It is through embracing my own mental health, both the good and the bad, that I have been able to receive help and recover during times of need. Everyone should be able to do this, regardless of your race, religion, gender or orientation, you have mental health and you have a right to look after it.

How to look after your mental health


THE MENTAL HEALTH FOUNDATION HAVE PUT TOGETHER 10 PRACTICAL WAYS TO LOOK AFTER YOUR MENTAL HEALTH.
Making simple changes to how you live your life doesn’t need to cost a fortune or take up loads of time. Anyone can follow this advice.
1.     TALK ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
Talking about your feeling can help you stay in good mental health and deal with times when you feel troubled. Talking about your feelings isn’t a sign of weakness. It’s part of taking charge of your wellbeing and doing what you can to stay healthy.
Talking can be a way to cope with a problem you’ve been carrying around in your head for a while. Just being listened to can help you to feel supported and less alone. And it works both ways. If you open up, it might encourage others to do the same.
It’s not always easy to describe how you’re feeling. If you can’t think of one word, use lots. What does it feel like inside your head? What does it make you feel like doing?
You don’t need to sit your loved ones down for a big conversation about your wellbeing. Many people feel more comfortable when these conversations develop naturally – maybe when you’re doing something together.
It feels awkward at first, give it time. Make talking about your feelings something that you do.

You have a right to feel alright
by admin on September 13, 2011


What does mental health mean to you? For many young people the phrase is meaningless, and as much as ones physical health is looked after, the same cannot be said for their mental health.
So what is mental health? The way you behave, and the way you feel are all down to your mental health. Whether you feel happy, bored, or sad, it is due to your mental health. When you feel good about yourself you don’t really pay attention to your mental health, however when you feel low and negative about yourself you tend to think about it more.
If you feel down, lonely, or sad for a prolonged period of time, you do not have to put up with it. You don’t deserve to feel this way. There are places for you to go, things that you can do to make yourself feel better. Just as we are all prone to catching a cough or a cold, we are also prone to experiencing some sort of emotional distress.
