Hannah was selected after successfully completing the Homeless FA Training programme at the Brighton & Hove Albion stadium, along with fellow YMCA DLG residents Omar Skogstrom-King (Horsham Y Centre) Joe Baldwin (Crawley Foyer) and Reece Richardson (Crawley Foyer).The 6-day FA training programme took place over six weeks during April and May. It’s run in partnership with professional football clubs across England. These training programmes are a great experience for all players, regardless of footballing ability, with every participant achieving an accredited leadership qualification.Last year saw YMCA DLG resident Jahobi Maher from Crawley Foyer being selected to play for the England squad in the Homeless World Cup, Santiago, Chile. This year Jahobi was back, only this time in the role of a mentor to the training programme’s new recruits.Gareth Parker, Head of the Homeless FA said, “We had our most successful year with Team England in 2014, but that is nothing compared to what the hundreds of men women at our Training Centres achieved during their time with us. What we do works as nearly two thirds of our players improved their housing situation. Almost half of them went on to further education and two thirds gained employment. Perhaps most importantly, every single player reported an increase in confidence and self-esteem.”Lee Scott, YMCA DLG Engagement & Learning Coordinator, Crawley said, “Scoring goals and Football skills are obviously important, but what really impresses me is the Homeless FA’s focus on developing positive attitude, teamwork, commitment, interpersonal and organisational skills, along with improving physical health.”Kevin Budge, Engagement and Learning Coordinator, Horsham said, “The Homeless FA sessions have given the residents a focus. It has taught them the importance of working together and given them an insight into peers issues whilst also enabling them to further their skills in an area they are interested in. The feedback from residents has been extremely positive.”       More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

The young people will need to have previous experience or serious interest in Painting & Decoration or gardening. It would be good if they already had some skills or knowledge but were looking to learn more and receive official training and qualifications.To qualify for the apprenticeship the young people will need to complete a 2 – 3 month work trial, working one to three days a week. Once accepted for the apprenticeship the young people will be signed up to a college course, providing they can pass the required numeracy and literacy entry tests.The apprenticeship programme lasts two years and the young people would get paid a salary during it. In the first year the apprentices would get paid £125 a week with the salary rising to a national minimum wage in the second year. Each young person would get assigned a mentor and they must commit to actively engaging with them as part of their apprenticeship.

As a result, the call for more joined up, adolescent friendly services has never been more important. To that end, Right Here has produced free new resources to help professionals working with young people deliver services that are more ‘youth friendly’ when it comes to mental health and emotional wellbeing. You can download these fantastic guides by going to Right Here’s research section of their website. The ‘How to…’ guides are designed to bring together learning from the five year Right Here programme initiated by Paul Hamlyn Foundation (PHF) and the Mental Health Foundation (MHF) to support the mental wellbeing of young people aged 16–25.Each guide focuses on a particular theme arising from the programme’s work across the UK and aims to provide practical pointers and suggestions to support the development of innovative and effective responses to the mental wellbeing of young people. Poor mental health is closely related to many other health and social concerns for young people, including educational achievements, employment, relationships and substance use. The ‘How to…’ guides address the professionals working in these areas, supporting: – Those delivering mental health and wellbeing services to help tackle some of the barriers which prevent young people from accessing traditional mental health services.

This is a huge worry for a lot of young people as rent prices soar and some parties don’t have policies to help make it easier.Both candidates seemed to struggle with the answer and wanted to find out more about what was already on offer.Ben and Will (band 3 and band 2 YMCA residents) both said afterwards that it definitely made them think more about using their vote when it comes to Election Day on Thursday 7th May 2015.

This time last year our allotment was in need of some TLC and with the help of our young people and some wonderful volunteers it has been turned into a great space.Our volunteers cleared the old pond and created a new one. With the help from Lloyds bank staff, who were there on their corporate team building day, we also created a wildlife area around the ponds.We worked on improving our poly tunnel by installing a front door and our young people built a bench inside made from old pallets. So soon we can start potting under a shelter.Last year we had a great harvest of strawberries, garlic, onions and potatoes, as well as courgettes and squash. Our young people really appreciated how great it is to eat fruit and vegetables that they have grown themselves.        More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

Thirteen English men and women who have faced homelessness flew to Santiago, Chile, on Thursday 16th October for the annual Homeless World Cup tournament featuring teams from 63 other nations.Jahobi Maher who was a resident at YMCA DownsLink Group’s Crawley Foyer but now lives at one of our move on properties, was selected for the national team after taking part in a five-week training programme back in April. Jahobi, along with three other YMCA DLG residents began training at the AMEX Stadium, home to Brighton & Hove Albion. Now, after being  selected for the Homeless FA national squad, Jahobi is training at the state of the art St. Georges Park National Football Centre, training ground for all of the England national football teams.When describing his experience Jahobi said, “This is all so unreal. I can’t explain it in words. If someone had told me three years ago that there would be an England kit with my name on it hanging up at the National Squad’s training ground, I would not have believed them.”      More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

In the weeks leading up to the performance our young people had the chance to get involved in a series of dance workshops delivered by the cast of the show.On the night the young people who took part in the dance workshops got to wear the official tour t-shirts, a special gift from the cast of the show. The night was made even more special when J.P Omari of BBC1′s Strictly Dance Fever series awarded our young people with certificates for attending the workshops. J.P called out the names of the young people from the stage and each name was greeted with a cheer from the Dome crowd.The show was an explosive new narrative dance work, integrating hip-hop, manga and martial arts. It told a story of five troublemakers that are sent to a rehabilitation camp for young offenders run by the Grand Master of martial arts who is also the Guardian of Prana – a secret warrior group entrusted with the protection of a spell controlling peace. When a rebellious warrior seeks to seize power, the five must lead the battle of good against evil.Before the show, some young people said that they weren’t sure if this was there thing but by the time it got to the interval the same young people were saying that they couldn’t wait to see how it ended.

We joined the online conversation from the YMCA DLG Twitter account by using the #UndercoverBoss hashtag. The feedback about the YMCA was great and it gave us an opportunity to promote our work to a wide audience nationally. You can have a look at #UndercoverBoss on Twitter to view the conversation (please note the feed will contain all tweets with #UndercoverBoss, not just the YMCA ones). To give an insight of the positive feedback we have posted some of the tweets below:Peter Jeffrey ‏@potejoffs Very proud and thankful for all the staff and volunteers at YMCA across our nation – they make such a difference #UndercoverBossTony Brady ‏@tonbaberdeen Just watched #UndercoverBoss what a great job the #ymca do, these folks really put others before themselves #makeadifferenceSarah Axford ‏@Sarahax84 Very proud to be a YMCA employee tonight.

Dogs live in the present moment and offer us non-judgemental, honest feedback in a way that humans often don’t. They teach us to be more aware of the connections between our mind, body and emotions, which can be really helpful when learning to manage mental health issues like anxiety. Pooka has given these young people an opportunity to relate with themselves and others in a different way!”A young person from Brighton who took part in the programme said:“It helped with my anxiety… the dog really helped and was a real icebreaker. It was a real confidence boost.”The next Walk & Talk is planned for 7th July and places are filling up fast!

The latest development was a resident meeting with a difference as it was run entirely by the residents with no staff members present. The newly recruited resident rep Emily chaired the meeting and prepared the agenda which included feedback, suggestions and a guest speaker. The resident also cooked the food for the meeting.Emily became the first ever resident rep in Horsham earlier this year after going trough an application process that involved a formal interview. The interviews were designed to be a two way process to find out if the residents are suitable but also to ensure that they understand the role and what would be required of them.The application process and the interviews proved to be a great experience for the residents and everyone received feedback on how they did.After the interviews Emily was offered the resident rep position and another Horsham Y Centre resident Malaki accepted the role of Vice rep. Emily and Malaki held their first resident meeting in March with support from the Engagement & Learning coordinator. The event was a great success and it was decided that the future resident meetings can happen without direct staff supervision.       More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

The Homeless World Cup mission is to use football to inspire homeless people to change their own lives. Team England for The Homeless World Cup is selected and managed by The Homeless FA.Hannah was selected to play for Women’s Team England from hundreds of players across the country after successfully completing Homeless FA’s Training programme. The six week training programme is run in partnership with professional football clubs across England and the Sussex one was delivered at the Brighton & Hove Albion stadium.Hannah came to the YMCA DLG Horsham Y Centre supported housing project after she had a family breakdown and had to move out of her parents’ home. Hannah has been at the Y Centre for over a year now and has managed to make many positives changes to her life, including getting back into playing football.Hannah said, “This opportunity is something I am honoured to have been given. It has really changed my life. I can’t thank everybody enough who has helped make this happen”.Horsham Y Centre Learning and Engagement Coordinator Kevin Budge said, “Hannah has done herself proud, she has battled through some tough personal issues and got this far due to her perseverance, enthusiasm and her sparkling personality. She used to play a lot and this opportunity has helped rekindle her passion for the game, I wish her and the team luck at the world cup and look forward to helping further Hannah’s skills and knowledge back in Horsham through playing for her local team and coaching others”All Homeless World Cup players have experienced homelessness or social exclusion and unlike any other England team, players are not picked according to their footballing ability, or age. Instead, players are selected with a particular focus on positive attitude, teamwork, commitment, interpersonal skills, and improved physical health.The Homeless World Cup football tournament has its own special rules. The fast-paced games are 4-a-side and played in two halves of seven minutes each, with a one minute break for halftime. Women’s and men’s teams compete for separate cups—however women can play on the men’s teams. Each team consists of up to eight players, four of which—three field players and one goalie—are on the court at a time.Image: Homeless FA Team England Female squad.

The main aim of the NCS programme is to offer young people from different backgrounds a chance to take part in meaningful activities that will improve their social skills, increase awareness and give them a summer to remember.The young people spend half of the four week programme on a residential and the other two weeks are for planning and delivering a community project. During the first week the young people went to the Isle of Wight staying in Kingswood Centre where trained instructors delivered a wide range of activities such as ‘leap of faith’, gokarting, going around an obstacle course blindfolded, archery, fencing, wood craft skills and a giant swing. The activities were designed to help the young people develop team working skills and learn how to overcome challenges and face personal fears.Exhausted but happy after the first week, the young people returned home to prepare for the next residential, this time happening closer to home at the University of Sussex. During the week the young people had a chance to get a taste of university life and they also visited a number of local organisations and charities. This was an opportunity for them to learn what goes on in the local community and also choose a cause for their social action project. During this week the young people also did some volunteering, took part in mediation sessions and a drumming workshop and heard a seaside safety talk from Brighton and Hove Council.The social action project is an important part of the NCS experience and the young people had just two weeks for preparing, planning and delivery so it was all hands on deck to do it in time. The young people had to project manage, communicate clearly and listen to what the charities wanted, they needed to work out the logistics and most importantly work as a team. Their group leaders and support workers were on hand for guidance but the young people were empowered to plan and deliver the project themselves.The young people worked hard and managed to raise over £3000 for their community projects. Some of of the organisations that benefited from the NCS social action projects were The Olive Tree, St Catherines Hospice, Southwell Lodge, Rivers Learning Project Community, Horsham Y Centre, Crawley foyer and Chestnut Treehouse. The NCS participants built a garden green house at our own Horsham Y Centre and painted a wall mural and redesigned the residents’ lounge at the Crawley Foyer.

Hannah calls her time in Amsterdam “a life changing experience”.Hannah was asked to play in goal for most of the games as the team did not have a designated goalkeeper. She performed well in a position she doesn’t normally play, but when unleashed on to the pitch she scored 3 goals in a win against France. The team got to the second qualifying stage but didn’t make it out of the group, click here to read more about the Homeless World Cup.Hannah has always been passionate about football and playing the World Cup has opened new opportunities for her. Last Saturday, 26th September, Hannah was invited to be a guest of honour at our Horsham YMCA’s FA Cup game against Aveley. She presented the match ball and gave out awards to the players. To read more about the game click here.After getting back from Amsterdam Hannah had a meeting with the Albion in the Community FC and was asked to join them as a volunteer, with a view of doing coaching for the club and also the Homeless FA. Hannah’s aim is to coach the next Team England preparing them for the 2016 Homeless World Cup in India so she will soon start a course to get her football coaching badge.Unfortunately Hannah hurt her knee ligaments which meant she returned to England on crutches but it hasn’t dampened her spirits. Hannah met lots of new friends from all over the world and has kept contact with a few of them and intends to visit. When her knee gets better Hannah plans to join the local women’s team in Horsham.       More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

Raleigh International was launched in 1978, known then as Operation Drake. Now Raleigh provides volunteering opportunities for young people on overseas projects designed to empower local communities to create lasting change and become more sustainable.Of our three residents, Gwen (Guildford Y Centre) spent ten weeks in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and Emilee (Brighton & Hove) and Dylan (Horsham Y Centre) went to Borneo. All three had an amazing time that pushed them out of their comfort zones and challenged their preconceptions.Gwen was part of a team that set about installing wells to provide safe drinking water for a community in Costa Rica. They also taught school children about the effects of logging on the rain forest, seeking to educate the next generation about preserving their environment and being sustainable. Gwen says, “It was an awesome experience working with the local community on different projects. I was impressed by the faith and confidence they had in us, that we would accomplish what we set out to do for them.”Gwen says that this experience has made her more confident and taught her that she can do anything that she sets her mind to. “I used to stay in the background and would just roll with the punches. I feel that I can be more assertive now, I’m more outspoken and believe that I can be more open with my thoughts and feelings”, Gwen says.Emilee faced several challenges at once during the trek element of her trip – dealing with heat and humidity, not being able to wash every day, as well as negotiating narrow pathways alongside sheer drops. Yet she coped far better than she expected. She says, “It’s the best thing I ever did and I have learnt so much, had so many new experiences and met some amazing people who I now call friends.  It was scary at first but so worth it in the end.”Dylan also travelled to Borneo but joined a different team to Emilee. He took a leading role on a building project for a community learning centre. This involved woodwork, painting, digging and concreting as well as rewriting the plans. Dylan says, “Being site coordinator gave me a chance to work as a team leader and to find peoples strengths to ensure the job got complete.”The team went on to building a suspension bridge at the picturesque Imbak Canyon. It was heavy physical work that required a half-mile human chain to move building materials down a hill. This was the phase where Dylan mixed with the locals. He says, “I really enjoyed meeting the locals and getting to know their culture and teaching them English.”The trip has been the catalyst for Dylan to move on from the Y Centre, having realised he has the skills to live independently. He has gone from struggling to cope in supported accommodation, and trying to manage his alcohol and drug issues to being drug free and one step away from independent living. Dylan has already signed up for a further overseas trip to Africa.

They experienced a backstage tour followed by a dressing room make-up seminar by Italian ballet pro Rafael.The young people were invited to watch the rehearsal for that night’s performance, they also had a chance to get on the stage with the cast and heard a motivational speech by Tory Dobrin, the artistic director of the New York based company.After a feast of pizza, our young people were given free tickets to the evening show, including back stage access to meet the cast and crew in costume. More photos were taken on the stage with the cast in costume during the interval while the rest of the audience waited the other side of the curtain for the show to continue. Such a unique experience that will be hard to forget!This is an extension of collaboration between the Dome, EDN, dance artists and YMCA DLG that has been ongoing for over a year now. It’s an opportunity for young people to experience various art forms first hand by taking part in free workshops run by experienced artists as well as being given unique access to The Brighton Dome.

We first assessed what my end goals were in terms of further education and have now moved on to the subject of how to get there. As I have a long term illness that affects my mobility, it has been valuable to have someone to talk to about it not controlling my life and being able to do what I want, which is to get into education. I have found this service extremely helpful in moving on and would recommend it to anyone”.The mentoring programme has been successfully worked alongside existing teams to provide an extra layer of support for some of our most vulnerable young people.The outcomes so far include:  young people attending full- time college courses; volunteering in charity shops and music venues; volunteering with animals; working at festivals over the summer and pop- up shops and seasonal events in Brighton; one mentee registering as self-employed and receiving guidance on completing tax returns; one mentee becoming a degree student of the Open University; two mentees gaining full time employment in their area of interest and young people finding part-time employment.

There are 75 Microsoft-supported Youth Hubs across the country run in partnership with a national charity called UK Youth. The Guildford one benefits the local young people by giving direct access to IT resources and training, equipping them with the skills they need for future employment.As part of the programme, Microsoft and UK Youth have trained two young people at Guildford Y Centre to become ‘IT Champions’. After being given support to develop their own IT skills, these ‘IT Champions’ can now pass on their knowledge and training to others, especially to those with limited access to technology.Anne Milton has been a supporter of Guildford Y Centre for many years. During her visit, Anne Milton was given a tour of the building which has undergone several changes over the last year, and chatted to young people using the Youth Hub. She said, “I am always pleased to visit the Guildford Y Centre but it was great this time to get the chance to see the Microsoft Youth Hub in action. It’s fantastic that Guildford was chosen for this initiative and it will be an invaluable way of making sure young people in the area get the skills they need. I know that it’s easy to feel isolated and overwhelmed by the digital world so I recognise the importance of teaching these skills at an early stage, especially for those with limited access to technology. I am sure the Guildford ‘IT Champions’ will keep up their great work and continue passing on their expertise!”Steve Darken, Guildford Services manager at Guildford Y Centre said, “We’re absolutely delighted that Anne has been able to come and see how we are working with Microsoft and UK Youth to offer even better support to local young people. We work with a lot of young people who aren’t aware of the huge role that IT can play in their lives, and we’re excited that we will now be able to change that with the help of Microsoft. It is so important that we find new ways to support our local community by providing vital computer skills, and instilling a new sense of confidence that might have been lost through unemployment.”      More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

The funding will pay for a Co-ordinator post so that the project can continue supporting local young people.Positive Placements is a programme that connects young people with mentors in their communities and provides a springboard for them to overcome the barriers to getting into employment.It is a really important programme in the current financial climate as young people are disproportionately affected by the impact of the recession, the recent Welfare Reform and the withdrawal of Government funding.Positive Placements programme has not only been really successful in supporting young people in to employment but also genuinely encourages a Youth Minded Community Approach, which reflects YMCA DLG’s vision and strategy for the future.This funding will enable Positive Placements to continue working with marginalised young people enabling them to belong, contribute and thrive in our society.

The last day at the current location will be Friday 1 April with the drop-ins reopening as normal on Monday 4 April at the new premises.YAC has been working in Brighton & Hove for over 22 years providing advice, support and guidance to local young people on a wide range of issues, including employment, mental wellbeing, benefits, sexual health and more. YAC is also the first place to go for housing advice for anyone under the age of 26 who is homeless or threatened with homelessness.Every year over 2500 young people access the different advice and support services delivered by YAC. The move offers an exciting opportunity for YAC to expand their service and hopefully support even more young people. The new drop-in is very central and easy to find with a colourful youth friendly shop-front and layout.YAC Advice Coordinator Cat Dyson said, “The move to 11 St George’s Place will give us a more visible and accessible location for young people to drop-in to. We feel this is really important and something that our service users have requested. We are very excited to relaunch YAC in its new location and to work closely with the local community by continuing to offer much needed support and advice to young people in Brighton & Hove”.James, one of the young people accessing support from YAC, said “For me, YAC is a safe place to come and get advice on things I cannot share with family and friends. It helps me to know that I have somewhere to go to talk about certain issues that affect me and get the support and guidance I need”.YAC Housing Advice drop-in (for 16-26 year olds) runs Mon-Fri, 9am-12pm and the general advice drop-in (for 13-25 year olds) is open Mon-Fri, 3pm-6pm.

This May YMCA DownsLink Group opened the doors of its Head Office at Reed House in Hove to exhibit an incredible array of art by their staff, young people, supporters and community artists. The aim of this exhibition is to raise money and awareness of the work of YMCA DLG as well as showcase incredible local art for everyone’s enjoyment. With the theme being ‘Belonging’, this exhibition really encompasses the sense of community, as well as advertises the diversity of talent, that characterises Brighton’s art scene.The exhibition occupies the ground floor of Reed House and the visitors are immediately struck by the fluid movement from one genre to the next that the layout allows. The works are not arranged according to artist, style, medium or level of training. Instead, the layout makes the exhibition a melting pot of styles and ideas, the message is that everyone can create exceptional and worthy art. This mirrors YMCA DLG’s aim to make all young people feel that they belong and are an integral part of the community. The positioning of the art made by YMCA DLG young people is crucial. Having their art by the front door reminds the visitors that this Open House is allowing them an entrance, not only into the local art community, but further afield reaching out to the wider community and thereby fulfilling the YMCA DLG’s mission of helping young people belong, contribute and thrive.Enhancing the theme of community, many of the artists got involved with the project because of personal as well as professional relationships with YMCA DLG. In a sense this exhibition has made Reed House its own art community; YMCA DLG young people become a part of this by exhibiting their work alongside local artists whose subjects often include Brighton and the surrounding landscapes.This Artists Open House definitely achieves the YMCA DLG’s goals of building a community spirit. The exhibition has such a diverse range of art and buzz that there is definitely something for everyone to enjoy. Most of the artwork is up for sale with a share of the profit (50% – 100%) being donated to YMCA DLG.Reed House is located at 47 Church Road, Hove BN3 2BE and the exhibition is open every Saturday and Sunday, 11am-4pm, 30th April – 22nd May.By Emma Wilder      More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

The generosity shown by so many people has been amazing, and very humbling.From the feedback forms of those that ‘slept rough’ for us it seems that the vast majority of them really got something out of the experience – in fact many have said they would happily do it again. Em Foster’s (YMCA DLG resident) words sum up the feelings of many: “Sleep Easy was a great experience. Fundraising was a challenge but I really enjoyed raising more awareness around youth homelessness. On the night, it was brilliant to meet some like-minded people as well as using boxes to make a shelter. It made me realise how much difference a bit of cardboard can make to your warmth when sleeping on the ground. It also was a very thought provoking experience for me as I only had to do it for one night. I can’t imagine having to do that every night. Such a great cause and I’m so glad I took part.”This was the first YMCA DLG Sleep Easy event to involve multiple locations – over fifty people took part and the impact of the event will have reached far, far further. Thank you to everyone that slept out, supported financially by making donations, or helped out on the night. We are hopeful that next year’s Sleep Easy will be even bigger and have an even greater impact in terms of raising awareness and also funds.Click here to have a look at more photos from the night.Inspired?

We are backing the findings from this report which warns that the ban will do little to reduce the harm these substances are having on many young people’s lives.New psychoactive substances (NPS) refers to newly available drugs that mimic the effects of drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy and powder cocaine, which may or may not be legal to buy but are often referred to as legal highs. This research seeks to address this gap in knowledge by investigating the motivations that young people have for using legal highs and the effect the Act will have on usage.While the research found that the blanket ban will likely reduce usage, in order to affect real behavioural change the Government must focus on the information, advice and support that is available to young people who may be experiencing harms associated with legal highs.Currently young people are ill-informed and unprepared for the very real risks that are associated with many legal highs. Throughout the research few young people had positive experiences to report of the harder end of legal highs, but still young people are continuing to experiment with substances akin to Heroin, without prior knowledge.Findings from the national report come from a survey of 1,005 16 to 24-year-olds from across all regions of England and Wales, half of whom had taken legal highs, and a range of focus groups. Some of the findings are that of those young people who currently take legal highs, 64% say they would be likely to use them in the future and 57% of young people first start taking legal highs between the ages of 16 and 18-years-old.The full findings from this research are set out in The Big Ban Theory report.

The residents have put forwards some great ideas and the staff are now looking for donations of things to help make this happen.The residents are keen to have gaming nights and although they have managed to source an Xbox 360 console, they don’t have any games to play on it. The young people are also interested in doing arts and crafts and are looking for materials to use and reuse. Another great idea from the residents was organising pamper nights so they can take more time to look after their skin, hair and nails.To make this happen we are looking for donations of the following items:Xbox 360 gamesOld clothes/fabrics, paper, paint/brushes and other arts and crafts materialsSpa kits, face packs, hair products, nail varnishes, moisturiser etc.If you can help please email communications@ymcadlg.org for more information.All donations would be greatly appreciated by Southwell Lodge residents and staff.

The young people were helped by volunteers from Crawley Borough Council, British Airways and Hilton Gatwick.Thanks to a grant from Crawley Borough Council an overgrown patch of land has been transformed into something beautiful. This will allow the young people to learn where their food comes from, plus engage in something positive.The young people and the volunteers worked hard clearing the land, digging the ground and building the raised vegetable beds. Everyone involved is now eagerly waiting for autumn to see all their hard work pay off when they harvest the first vegetables.Southwell Lodge is a supported housing project for up to 10 people aged 16-18 at a time. The project aims to encourage the residents to engage and participate in developing a greater appreciation for their environment, broaden their knowledge of food production, build on cooking skills and promote physical activity.Lee Scott, Engagement and Learning Coordinator at YMCA DLG, said: “It was fantastic to see the young people and volunteers from the wider community coming together to create something so positive and having a great day in the sunshine.”       More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

He was scared that sooner or later the police would find a reason to imprison him again. Scared for his life and future Ameer fled the country with the help of some family friends who smuggled him on to a French cruise ship. Ameer spent 23 days in a dark, cramped engine room without seeing the daylight and survived by eating dates.When Ameer finally arrived in France, he spent three months trying to get on to a lorry to come to the UK. Ameer didn’t want to seek asylum in France because he was worried that the French Government would deport him back to Sudan. He was arrested just after arriving in England and after spending a few days at a detention centre was sent to Glasgow. Whilst waiting for a decision on his asylum application Ameer was using the internet to find out more about the UK. He found a Wikipedia page about Brighton and fell in love with the city just by reading about it.When Ameer was granted asylum he scraped together all his savings and bought a train ticket to Brighton.After arriving in Brighton with no money and nowhere to go Ameer was sleeping rough on a bench in Palmeira Square until someone advised he should go to the council and ask for support. The council referred Ameer to YMCA DownsLink Group’s YAC service that is the first point of access for housing advice for anyone under the age of 26.The advice worker at YAC was able to offer Ameer a placement with Sussex Nightstop, a service that matches volunteer hosts with young homeless people on night-to-night bases.Ameer stayed with a range of hosts whilst studying English at college and doing a course to become a security guard.During this time, Ameer attended YAC general advice drop-in to get support on a range of issues. As he says himself, he felt safe with YAC knowing that if something happens they will offer support and advice.Eventually YAC were able to offer Ameer a place in one of YMCA DLG’s Empty Homes properties. Empty Homes is a scheme that brings empty properties back into use to provide affordable and safe accommodation to young people in housing need.On 15th February, Ameer moved into his own room in a flat sharing with four other young people. Now he has a safe base from where to build his new life in the UK. Ameer is looking for employment and has started an Access course, as he wants to go to university and study business and IT.

After being thrown out of her home she presented as homeless to the YMCA DownsLink Group’s Youth Advice Centre where, following an assessment, staff were able to offer her a safe place to stay in YMCA DLG accommodation.At this time Lucy faced a variety of challenges in her life. In addition to being ostracised by her family Lucy experienced homophobic abuse and was significantly affected by an undiagnosed mental health issue, alcohol misuse and prolific self-harming.YMCA staff liaised with mental health and substance use services to ensure that Lucy received the support she needed. YMCA staff worked with Lucy to ensure she was safe and in a stable supported position from which she could begin to move forward in her life.This package of support provided Lucy with a stable platform from which she could start considering her employment options. At this point that she was referred to the YMCA DLG’s Positive Placements project. Positive Placements matches a volunteer mentor with a young person who wants to be supported to identify and achieve the steps they need to take to access employment, education or training.Lucy and her mentor Chris began meeting on a weekly basis. In the beginning their focus was on building trust and rapport and starting to explore the steps that Lucy could take towards employment. With the support from her mentor and YMCA DLG staff Lucy was referred to a ‘return to work’ course from which she gained a work experience placement that has successfully led on to paid employment. Chris has supported Lucy every step of the way, being there when she needed support and encouragement.Chris describes her mentoring role as, “Being an ‘interested person’ in her life. Not mother, sister or even friend, just someone who has an interest in her as an individual and hopefully I show her that she is well worth being around. I have a sense of pride that I have helped to set her on a more positive path. It has not always been easy – and has definitely sometimes been a rollercoaster ride. In fact, I have got such a lot out of the experience that I am volunteering to take on another young person alongside my initial mentee.”         More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

With over half (56%) of residents feeling ready to move on but unable to do so, and one in five (20%) left waiting for over six months.The reasons why people are unable to move out of supported housing include a lack of suitable low-cost housing, landlord decisions which prevent those on benefits or low income from taking on a property, high costs of rent and living, coupled with the fact that less than a third (30%) are able to save any money for a deposit.Download Delayed until further notice      More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

In that time she has made the most of the fresh opportunities offered to her to change her life for the better.She recalls, “When I was still living at home I was struggling with my mental health, and there were frequent arguments with my family.  My Dad and step mum were breaking up, home life became very unsettled and in the end I was thrown out of the family home.“At that point I went to YAC (YMCA’s Youth Advice Centre in Brighton).  I knew they helped homeless people so I went to them for advice.  I had nowhere to stay although I knew a bit about the YMCA because I’d volunteered with one of their projects.“Anyway thanks to YAC I was offered somewhere to live in a YMCA hostel.  It felt safe and secure and gave me a base where I could start to get my life back on track.  I got a lot of support there, particularly with my mental health.  Through the YMCA and YAC I was able to access other services.“When I was made homeless I was scared about where I might end up, but with the support and high quality service I’ve received I had nothing to worry about.“I’ve also had some fantastic opportunities that I never could have imagined.  Last summer I went to Borneo with Raleigh International, to work and promote sustainable development in remote and poor communities.  Without YMCA support I would never have done that – it was a once in a lifetime experience and for that I’m truly grateful.“I’m really grateful for the opportunities I’ve had. I’ve been able to join the YMCA DownsLink Group’s Young People’s Board – we work towards getting the views and opinions of young people heard and considered by those higher up in the organisation.“In the future I’d love to work in probation, prison or youth work.  Meanwhile I’ll be spending this summer working with young people on the National Citizenship Scheme programme.  I am grateful to the YMCA for the support and opportunities given to me, which I believe have helped me to secure this work.”      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

From that point on she began to turn her life around.Alys missed quite a lot of school as a teenager, she recalls never being at school preferring instead to be on the streets. Looking back she describes herself as ‘mouthy’ and had several run-ins with the police.  At the same time she says, “I felt as if I had an underground sadness that I never thought I could conquer”.When Alys needed somewhere to live, a room at the Foyer was available.   At the time she wasn’t working, having been signed off sick, and the future was looking bleak.She started meeting with her key worker, and found their conversations really helpful. Her keyworker lent her a book about change, commenting, “Change doesn’t have to be scary”.Alys started studying for English and Maths exams – a challenge considering how much schooling she had missed, but with a new positive attitude she really began to pick things up quickly. When her keyworker suggested she try volunteering her first reaction was very negative.  She says, “In my mind volunteering was working for nothing…little did I know that giving my time would feel so good!”Alys has since gone from strength to strength, making the most of every opportunity presented to her. She moved on to live independently and secured a cleaning job back at the YMCA.  In her interview she made a lasting impression, saying she could do a better job than the existing cleaner!Alys had aspirations for the future. She says, “I wanted to work with kids with the same mentality I had so I can give back what I have learned.”  Alys has gone even further to realise this dream, by becoming an Engagement Worker with 16-18 year olds in a YMCA hostel.  She has done this through her own incredible resilience and determination, helped by the encouragement and support she received.  Her former keyworker is now her colleague – both of them are inspirations.

as a result I found private rented accommodation in Brighton.“In 2012, I came into contact with YMCA again but this time as a volunteer for the Right Here project.  I joined the Activities Team which helped to research, organise and facilitate activities for young people aged 16-25 who were experiencing emotional and mental health issues as well as social anxiety and/or isolation.“During my time in this role I helped to facilitate anger management courses as well as outdoor ‘walk and talk’ counselling groups.  I also had the opportunity to organise social events for young people with games, art, music, cooking and the chance to meet other young people in similar situations.  After some changes to Right Here at the end of 2013, unfortunately the activities team could no longer continue and it wasn’t until 2015 that I again became involved with the YMCA.“Last year (2015) I started volunteering at YAC working with the Support and Advice team.  They offer young people a space to talk about emotional well-being, get advice about education, work or training and general guidance.  During this time I developed my skills in working directly with young people, learning how to ascertain their needs and what possible solutions there are or how best I could help them.“One client I worked with briefly needed someone talk to about their emotional well-being and also identified issues with drugs.  It was one of the most difficult sessions I had co-worked and after asking questions and listening carefully to their story I wasn’t sure what to do next.  With the support of the Advice Coordinator, it was arranged that the client would come back for further support.  Following on from this initial session they felt listened to in a way which other professional support unfortunately hadn’t offered and they independently made a plan of what the issues were and how best to find a resolution.“Through these voluntary roles I had the opportunity to integrate with the team at YAC and across other parts of YMCA DLG.  Overall I had such a brilliant experience volunteering that it gave me the motivation and confidence to move into my current paid role as both a Receptionist and Housing Advisor for YAC.  I now offer housing advice to 18-25 year olds, which is the same service that was provided to me once upon a time ago!“My favourite part of this role is interacting with young people and it is really satisfying to see that young people leave the service with all the information they need to move forward with their situation.  What I have found most challenging in my role as a housing advisor is managing the expectations of young people and helping them to understand the options open to them, when often these can be limited.  I aim to try and empower young people to make the decision that is best for them.“I can’t express enough how important volunteers are to the organisation and as a young person I feel very empowered by my own progress, and I hope volunteers future and current see the value of this.  I hope my story is a good example of how a journey can progress over time and can lead to great opportunities.  I am very grateful for YMCA as a service that is open to young people both to support them and also allow them to be involved with how the organisation works.”We’re delighted to have Sam as a colleague!Find out more about the housing drop-in service at YAC here.

The service claims that more support is needed for young people online to help them better manage online friend and relationships as Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and cyberbullying can have a significant effect on young people’s mental health and emotional wellbeing.Project Leader Jay Tregenza says: ‘We know that young people are spending increasing amounts of time online and whilst for many this is a positive experience, some young people report negative effects on their emotional wellbeing. This could be due to the pressure of keeping up with friends on social media as well as trying to navigate sensitive online relationships.  Where the nature of digital communication can mean things like tone of voice and body language is missing,  this makes arguments more likely. We want to appeal to young people to be more critical users of the online world,  champion and share positive social behaviours that promote peer support, and make being online an emotionally healthy place to be for our teenagers!  All of our counsellors at e-motion model positive online interaction and are specially trained in doing this.”Young people can get involved in the campaign by taking to social media and posting their most important qualities in friendships online. Don’t for get to use the hashtag #friendsmatter to be entered into a prize draw to win Love2Shop vouchers!Young people 13-25years,  looking for support can access FREE online counselling with E-Motion by emailing frankie@e-motionbh.org.uk or visiting the website www.e-motionbh.org.uk      More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

Unable to cope with being bullied, she dropped out of university, and when her relationship broke up she had nowhere to live.  But thanks to the opportunities she found at her local YMCA she has started to rebuild her life and is making positive choices about the future.Gwen’s first contact with YMCA was when she took part in a 12 week Prince’s Trust Team course. She found it helped her to decide what she wanted to do with her future, and subsequently she started on a nursing degree at university.  Unfortunately she was subjected to bullying, and after just six weeks she dropped out.  Gwen says, “I was OK until my relationship with my boyfriend broke up and I had nowhere to live.  At that point I spent about a month in a night shelter, having to leave after breakfast every day.  There was no one my age there and I really wanted somewhere safe to live.”She was offered a room in the local YMCA hostel. Although she was unsure of what to expect of hostel life, she was happy to move in with people her own age, and she knew some staff already because of the earlier Prince’s Trust Team course.  Over the following months she took advantage of the opportunities that came her way.  “When I first moved in I was really quiet and kept in the background.  But I found living here I could try new things.  There used to be an Art class that I really enjoyed.  And then last year I was able to go to Costa Rica with Raleigh International.  That was an amazing experience.  Since I’ve been here I’ve developed more confidence and I’ve learnt to be more assertive.”And what does the future hold for Gwen? She is moving out of the YMCA into her own accommodation, and she’s also raising funds to go to Tanzania in September with Raleigh International Citizen Services.  “I’m interested in overseas relief work.  I’ll be in Tanzania for about three months, and we’ll be working on sustainability and clean water projects for local communities.“I feel I’ve now got a vision for the future. I’m planning to go back to university to do a Nursing degree.  I’ve had great support here, and been given opportunities I never expected to have.  I would say to others don’t give up.  There’s always light at the end of the tunnel.  I could still be staying in a night shelter, but instead my life has really been enriched.”      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

They both used me as a weapon to get at each other with violent fights over who would see us and who owned what so I ran away when I was 14.I stayed at random people’s houses and dealt drugs to support myself. I ended up taking them myself. But in this vulnerable state I was abused whilst staying at one man’s house. Because I lived in a small town this soon got back to my family who took me back home but the damage was already done. I was addicted to heroin and taking other drugs to block out reality.Living with my Mum turned bad after the divorce. She started laying into me and I had a nervous breakdown. I was sectioned but the hospital took me off all my medication apart from methadone and kicked me out. I had nowhere to live, and a mental health problem with no support or medication.I started sofa surfing and sleeping rough until thankfully I was able to move into the local YMCA. They gave me two meals a day and a comfortable room to stay in. I got support from the Housing team and I was offered counselling. I lived at the YMCA for about two years, before moving on to live more independently at another YMCA property. I lived there for 18 months until I was offered a house by the local council. I’m now finished with drugs and working part time.If I hadn’t had a room at the YMCA then I don’t know where I would be today, probably laying dead in a gutter.”      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

He underwent complicated surgery to reduce the chronic pain but still has only limited mobility in that hand.  During this time he was staying with his mother but their relationship was affected so badly that ultimately he moved out.David picks up the story, “The post-traumatic stress hit me and that affected my relationship with my mother.  Over time, my housing situation changed from staying with her to being homeless. I stayed in my car for three months, roughing it on the streets. I wanted to have somewhere to live.  I started eating less and my anxiety increased.  One of my biggest challenges was dealing with my worry; I would normally wake up at 5am and from that time I had massive worry about where I was going to stay that night.”Due to his deteriorating mental condition, he was eventually taken in to a local residential mental health service where people in crisis can find some respite.  After a short stay they referred him to the YMCA.The YMCA Empty Homes scheme brings empty rental properties back into use, refurbishing the property and then managing the tenancy on behalf of the landlord. Many properties have been made available to young people that would otherwise be standing empty.David says, “YMCA Empty Homes ticked all the right boxes.  Firstly, I could access support 24 hours a day.  Then, as soon as I met the Service Manager, he was on the ball; he showed the right attitude, full of information and with a complete understanding of my needs and the help I required.  I moved into my own place in March 2014.  My best memory is the day I got housed and I filled in the tenancy agreement.”David is still in a legal battle to bring closure to his accident.  He has to cope with day-to-day challenges like pain, medication, continuing medical checks and dealing with the legal matters involved in his court case.“I’ve had ups and downs over the last two years but the help provided by YMCA has been consistent and accessible – it’s been always there for me.  I’ve got my place, my privacy and I find the interaction very reassuring – they keep me informed and I know where I stand.  Changing from living in a car to a flat has been healthy.  I have been very lucky.“I’m not half as stressed as I used to be.  Living on my own has also given me a template for structure and routine.  In addition, it has laid the foundation for a better relationship with my mum.  There have been some important changes.  Now I have a home and my mental health is a lot better since I first got in contact with YMCA.  I’m realising I’m a much stronger person now.“I hope I can return to work in the future.  I’m looking into accessing new training and even into the possibility of a career change.  I’m grateful to the YMCA, without it my situation would be quite stressful and the future would be unclear.  There is no future in the past, now I’m looking forward.  And to any young person in crisis like I was I would say grasp the opportunity with both hands as the care the YMCA provides is so helpful.”David’s YMCA Empty Homes worker says, “I met David soon after he moved into YMCA Empty Homes.  His case is inspirational and he is a tremendous example of resilience.“David has suffered ups and downs in his mental health but he has found the strength to address issues and access the necessary help in order to make changes to improve it.  No matter how challenging his situation has been, he continues to always be polite and he has a welcoming approach.”David is looking forward to having his court hearing and putting an end to this difficult chapter in his life.  On this tough journey, David has gained a variety of skills and he has become more aware of his strengths and gained confidence.  We are delighted that YMCA Empty Homes has given him the fresh start and solid base that he needed and wish him every success in the future.

There have been plenty of those telling him what to do.  My role is to listen, prompt, suggest, support and keep turning up.“As a mentor I have definitely developed better listening skills.  I believe I have a better understanding of the pressures faced by young people these days.  And I have a better understanding of the very complex and inflexible benefits system and associated red tape.“Mentoring has certainly been valuable for my own career development.  I have developed useful skills that I can use in every other area of my life.”Rachel concludes, “Some people volunteer to give something back, but for me the greatest reward is to be part of the process as a young person works to turn their life around.  When they are ready to move, that is when Positive Placements can be effective.”More information about Positive Placements can be found here.       More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

Artist’s impression of the new Midwey House design (to be know as YMCA Guildford Foyer when finished)Work has already begun to create the extra spaces and the building should see the first young residents move in around May 2017. Chas Walker told the assembled audience of church leaders, local stakeholders, individual and corporate supporters and volunteers that the new development will be a home for those who are ‘work ready’ but still need a helping hand. Chas said, “This opportunity to improve and expand our offer to local young people is exciting for us, but in order to do so we will need the support of local stakeholders and businesses over the coming months.”  The new housing project will have 24 hour staff support and encourage the residents to engage with training and education with a view to finding permanent employment. As part of this process the young people will also have the opportunity to meet with local volunteer mentors through the YMCA Positive Placements project.

The building has shown its age for some time, and this redevelopment is timely. When it reopens it will be known as YMCA Guildford Foyer.Local businesses and individuals are being invited to sponsor spaces such as the 34 self-contained rooms, the communal kitchen or the outdoor space.  Smaller donations will contribute towards creating welcome packs for the young people as they move in.

The Youth Matters 2016 awards ceremony was held on Friday 4 November at the exclusive central London venue, 8 Northumberland Avenue and hosted by TV presenter June Sarpong MBE. With ten categories for nominations, winning three awards this year is a remarkable achievement.An inspiring young person from YMCA DLG beat off competition to be crowned Young Leader of the Year at the ceremony. Emily, one of our YMCA DLG residents, triumphed over two other inspirational young people. This award recognises the young person’s ability to make a real difference in their YMCA by bringing about positive change, working with vision and inspiring others.Emily was praised by judges for her immense courage and determination. Despite battling complex trauma, Emily is warm, committed and reliable. Since living at YMCA DLG, Emily has been actively involved in the organisation as a founding member of the Young People’s Board and with other activities.Emily said: “I am really excited to have won such a significant award. Even reaching the final stage was overwhelming. My life has changed so much since getting involved with YMCA and I appreciate everyone who has supported me. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to attend the ceremony in person as I’m in Tanzania volunteering with Raleigh International but when I found out I’d won I felt extremely happy and grateful.”The prestigious title of Accommodation Project of the Year was awarded to YMCA DLG’s YMCA Empty Homes. This project has operated across Sussex for the past five years, refurbishing unused properties to provide accommodation for young people in housing need. It has proved to be an innovative way of bringing housing back into use, with the YMCA infrastructure able to offer support to the young tenants and peace of mind to the landlords.The Training & Education Project of the Year award was given to YMCA Positive Placements, a project which operates in Brighton, Mid Sussex, Horsham and Guildford. YMCA Positive Placements matches volunteer mentors from the local community with disadvantaged young people to help them get back into education, work or training. Once again, it creatively harnesses local resources, in this case skills and talent in the locality to enable young people to make real progress towards work and independence.YMCA DLG triumphed after battling off strong competition from across England and Wales during shortlisting, a public vote and a final decision by judges. It was praised for its innovative approach in transforming communities and tackling youth unemployment.Chas Walker, Chief Executive of YMCA DLG, said:“We are overjoyed and excited to have won these three significant awards. It is brilliant to receive recognition for our innovative projects and I am particularly pleased to see Emily named as Young Leader of the Year, she absolutely deserves it. Thank you to everyone in the community who supported us by voting; we couldn’t have won without you.“Our vision is that all young people should belong, contribute and thrive. Between them these three awards acknowledge that that is what we do.”Read more about YMCA Empty Homes here.Read more about YMCA Positive Placements here.         More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

She tells her story.“Before I came to Crawley Foyer I was living at home with my Mum. We got on OK but not all of the time.  I needed my own space and if I had stayed I think it would have ruined our relationship.  It was time to stand on my own two feet and learn how to deal with money, and look after important things like paying the bills and finding work.“I had some friends already living in the Foyer and I thought it would help me to find work and improve my life skills.“When I first moved in I felt nervous but after a while I got used to it. I started going to the Job Club, and I benefitted from the key working sessions.  The YMCA has helped me learn how to pay bills and keep on top of things.“Now I am working full time at a travel insurance company and things have worked out really well for me. I lived at the Foyer for about 9 months, and then moved into a shared house.  I was then given a one bedroom flat.  And this year I was nominated to move into a brand new flat!  I am very lucky to be given a beautiful brand new home, I am really grateful.  Thank you to the Crawley YMCA Move On team for your support.”Jenny Burling has worked with Georgie for about three years and says, “It has been great to see her grow in confidence and self belief. Significantly Georgie has overcome problems with self-esteem, budgeting and finding employment.  She has had to deal with personal trauma in her family and friendship group and has become a confident young lady who is working full time and achieving the goals she has set herself.”As Georgie starts this new phase of her life we wish her every success. Photo shows Georgie collecting the keys to her new home.

However, there are hundreds of thousands of young people across England and Wales for whom the experience is very different. Mental health difficulties among children and young people are common and can be both persistent and damaging.However, the challenges that young people face are not limited to the symptoms mental health difficulties; many must also take on the day-to-day stigma that too often goes with this. By giving young people the platform to share their views and stories, I AM WHOLE seeks to go beyond the headline statistic ‘one in 10 young people experience mental health difficulties’ that so often dominates the discourse.This report seeks to get under the surface and understand the real experiences of those with mental health difficulties. This is done by examining the prevalence of this stigma, who is experiencing it and how they are doing so, the impact of this stigma, and the potential solutions that the young people themselves have identified.Click here to read the full report.       More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

While a focus on the importance of appearance in society is by no means a new phenomenon, many young people today are struggling to escape the constant barrage of messages they receive about how they should look and how they should behave.Through powerful outlets such as print, television, film and digital media, young people are repeatedly presented with images of the ‘ideal’ body. The pressures to conform to these ‘ideals’ are reinforced by their peers and through social media in the ever-connected world in which they now live.Given the wide range of contributing factors and the differing ways young people can experience issues with body confidence and body image, making positive changes in this area requires a range of approaches.As part of this research, young people were given the space to discuss and share their experiences. Their views and ideas were then used to create practical solutions that both they and others can take forward to help tackle body image anxiety in the UK.To help tackle the growing body image anxiety experienced by young people, this research proposes that action be taken to:Tackle the body image ‘ideals’ presented to young people.Reduce the value placed on appearance in society.Encourage schools to become settings that promote and foster body confidence among young people.Support parents and carers to help promote body confidence among young people.Equip young people with the means to tackle the causes of body image anxiety.The findings from this research are set out in the Somebody Like Me Report.Also available to download is a Somebody Like Me Executive Summary.If you want to find out more about this research or if you have a query please contact YMCA England’s Policy team on policy@england.ymca.org.uk.

The manifesto was created in consultation with YMCAs all over the country.Questions asked by the audience included:“Brexit has been decided, what are your plans to manage it?”“What would you do about education in secondary schools such as Portslade Aldridge Community Academy and Brighton Aldridge Community Academy losing 19 teachers by the end of 2019?”“How will the Labour Party fund cutting tuition fees?”“What are your views on immigration?”“If you were to legalise cannabis which is damaging for mental health, how would you manage it?”“What would be the first three issues the Green Party would address if elected?”Chas Walker said, “It is essential that young people’s voices are front and centre of any election debate and this year is no different.  YMCA and One Church Brighton trust the hustings event has raised important issues around fairness and opportunity for all in our society.

Since then we have been busy working together to design and develop the new service.This contract replaces the existing community and online counselling delivered by Dialogue and Young People’s Centre (YPC). The new service will bring referral systems together for children, young people and adult’s mental health provision to provide a more integrated and joined up wellbeing offer.The new service has been designed based on the feedback from professionals, children, young people and their parent / carers. It aims to put in place a new mental health pathway that joins together Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), Adult Mental Health Service (AMHS), Mind  and the YMCA to ensure that people can find out information and can seek help early, referring into one ‘front door’ in order to get the appropriate response and level of support as soon as possible.So what will change?From 1 June all referrals for counselling will go through a centralised triage hub staffed by all the partners.  People working with children and young people can complete a simple form to refer into the service. Young people can also self-refer. The partners will triage every day to speed up referral processes and ensure that people get into the system as quickly as possible.This means that you will not be able to ring up Dialogue or YPC to book appointments directly.  However, there are more resources going into the CWS to create a wellbeing menu of interventions which includes access to IAPT (Improved Access to Psychological Therapies) for those aged 18+, as well as complementing and joining up activity undertaken by the Primary Mental Health Service in Schools..The new number to call is 0300 002 0060 or you can email BICS.brighton-and-hove-wellbeing@nhs.net      More InfoBrighton & HoveCrawleyGuildfordHorshamLewesWorthingYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

That first evening I was trying to watch a programme on the computer in the entrance hall but Judi (volunteer chaplain) kept talking to me.  In the end I turned the computer off and went over to the chaplaincy group for a chat.  The free donuts helped too – especially at first!“After that I popped down to see them most weeks. To be honest it made the hostel feel more like home.  It wasn’t just the donuts…talking to them each week has made me feel less lonely.  Looking back I felt quite isolated when I first lived here and I feel less lonely now.  As well as meeting the chaplains it gave me the chance to get to know other residents too.“Apart from that it’s been good to know that someone notices how you are. I get on great with my keyworker and meet with her regularly but sometimes it’s good to get a different opinion.  There have been times when I’ve been struggling and I’ve appreciated being able to share that with the chaplains, I feel they have heard my pain.“I know they will be there each week – that really helps particularly if I have had a bad week. Having someone who is happy to see me makes me feel better – and it’s a chance to hang out with other residents too.  And we love the free donuts!”A chaplain is someone, usually from a church or faith group, who wants to support the community. There are often chaplains in hospitals, sometimes in schools and in all sorts of everyday settings.YMCA volunteer chaplains are here to offer support to residents and staff. The daily pressures of life can get to us all.  Our volunteer chaplains are here to listen and to chat, and if you have worries, large or small, you can share them if you want to.  Everything is confidential unless they are worried for your safety or someone else’s safety.They are also here to explore spiritual issues with you if you choose, and if you would like them to pray with you or for you, you can just ask. They will not try to convert you to their faith; they will respect what you believe. They are here for everyone, no matter what your spiritual beliefs or background.Hayley continues, “Where religion’s concerned I grew up thinking God was ashamed of you and you need to work harder, rather than thinking there’s a God who loves me. I’m not sure whether I believe in God or not but it has shown me that there is a side of Christianity which is more accepting.  I only found out recently that the chaplains are happy to pray for anyone who asks – I kind of think they have already been praying for me anyway!”Read more about our Chaplaincy here. *Name and photo have been changed to protect the identity of the young person      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

He didn’t come to watch me but he did turn up after the show had finished.  I asked him if he would come to the party but he said, “No,I’m here to pick you up and that’s it.”  That was the first time that I asserted myself and said “No!” to him.  I stayed there at the party until the end and I said goodbye to my friends properly.  I was proud of myself for saying no.It wasn’t until I spoke to my friend who said, “This isn’t normal, you need to get some help.”  I knew that I had to get out of my relationship but I couldn’t see a way out, I was too scared of what he might do to me.About this time my keyworker at the hostel told me about the YMCA WiSE project.  She said that it might help me move on and get over stuff.  I thought it couldn’t hurt and so a week later I met Gemma (YMCA WiSE Project Worker) and she told me what the Project was about and how they could help me and that kind of stuff.  Gemma didn’t have time to take me on so she asked Helen (YMCA WiSE Project Worker) to get involved.I actually broke up with my ex-boyfriend before I started meeting with Helen.  I felt relieved that he wasn’t part of my life anymore but he was still constantly emailing, calling, and texting me.Meeting with Helen once a week, we talked a lot about the stuff that was going on and also about what happened during the relationship.  I started to realise that I wasn’t actually aware of how serious the abuse that I experienced had been.  Helen helped me to see that it was never my fault, it was always his fault because he is what they call a ‘game player’.  He knew how to latch on to me and keep that bond alive.  Helen gave me lots of advice on how to move on and stay single, which has been quite a hard goal for me.  I’ve learnt to let go of the relationship and to be myself.Helen has always been lovely to me.  She understands and listens to me.  She has different perspectives and experiences and relates so much to what I tell her.  Helen has helped me to set some goals in my life to help me stay more focused.  We made my career the focus of my life and nothing else.  Working with Helen has been a wakeup call and it has let me think about myself for a change.I am looking forward to moving into my own place soon so that I can live independently and get out of the hostel.  I’ve also got two jobs working in bars in the evening.  Before I’d never go out at all but these days I’m going out more with my girls and stuff like that.  I’ve got a lot more friends now and I’m still single which is all groovy.  Actually I’m starting to be me again, I’m coming to life.My performance career is off to a flying start and I’m finally getting back with Glyndebourne and getting on with my career.  I’m an opera singer, a dancer, an actor and an acrobat, which is fun but a lot of work.  I’m doing a dance project at the moment and there is a show in three weeks’ time.  I can’t wait!  I have also been offered a lead role next year, paid work this time!  And I finally got onto the books of an agency in London.  They’ve given me a role in ‘Snow White’ in December which is good, a bit scary but hey ho.  I’m finally focusing on what I want to do.  I’ve been training for opportunities since I was three years old which is like 17 years and I’m not giving up now.  I’m literally almost there and I am so excited about it.  It is literally about to go off!The YMCA WiSE Project has helped me to get to grips with reality rather than living a fake life.  I recognise that I have always ended up in relationships with men who exploit me and I’m trying to break that pattern.  I’ve learnt to be myself again rather than being a character.  These days I’m definitely more wary with regards to guys. I can now read the signs, who is a decent guy and who is not.  Who is playing games and who is actually being a real person.  I can tell the difference now, which is good.If I saw one of my friends going through what I went through I would tell them that they have to go and talk to somebody and take a second to stop and breath and think about what they’re doing and what they actually want.  My advice would be that you need to review the relationship and understand what it is that he is giving to you and what you are giving back.If it isn’t equal then it’s not going to work out.  Are you being taken advantage of?  Is he making you do sexual stuff you don’t want to?  Is he taking your money or your time or not letting you see your friends?  Are you treated right some days and then completely ignored the next?  If so, he’s probably not the right person for you.  If it feels like he is in control of the relationship that’s not right.  You should both be in control of it and you should both be living your own lives.At the end of the day you have to put yourself first.  You always come first and if that isn’t the case then why are you with him?  Think about it and then make a choice.  If it’s not worth it then get out while you can.  That’s my advice.Read more about YMCA WiSE here.*Name and photo changed to protect the young person’s identity      More InfoYMCA WiSEYMCA WiSE – Children & Young PeopleYMCA WiSE – Parents & CarersYMCA WiSE – Multi Agency ProfessionalsThe YMCA WiSE TeamYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

He says, “I’m passionate about working with young people.  When I heard about the YMCA I felt there would be a good fit between how I work and how the YMCA works.  Having an impact on young people’s lives and looking to help them from all angles – socially, emotionally and practically, and accessibility is important.  Young people can access the YMCA.”“I wanted to volunteer because when I was young I had strong mentors and adults I could relate to for advice and emotional support. I want to offer this to another generation.  The YMCA seems to be really thoughtful in how that support is delivered.”Mark now volunteers as an Honorary Counsellor, working one day a week as part of a counselling team. He has noticed demand on the counselling service increases around exam time.  Young people can be struggling to cope with many aspects of life, from social pressures to global issues, family life or general anxiety.  A significant pinch point is the notion that making the wrong decision now will impact the rest of life.Mark finds the work rewarding and meaningful. “It’s great to see the change in the young person over ten sessions.  Maybe there’s a decrease in anxiety, or identifying the root of their distress.  I enjoy offering them a safe space to do this, and being on that journey with them.  For myself, I find I feel less alone, more connected to people which is really important to me.  You meet people from all walks of life and come to understand the ‘human struggle’ is universal.  It has been so rewarding to witness a change take place in a young person that I have helped with, and he is able to take that change into the world outside.”In conclusion Mark says, “I think my work at the YMCA has a massive impact on young people’s lives, and they support me in supporting them. I feel held and looked after, so as a placement for someone in training it feels like a safe and fertile ground in which to start my practice.” Find out more about Dialogue here.

I would really encourage anyone who is passionate about mental health and young people to consider volunteering for YMCA Right Here! It’s an amazing opportunity to make change, meet friends, and gain skills.”Emily first became involved with YMCA DownsLink Group in September 2015 when she joined a YMCA Right Here volunteer group. YMCA Right Here is a youth-led project based in Brighton and Hove that aims to promote and improve the mental health and wellbeing of young people.  Emily says, “Mental health has long played an important role in my life, and in the lives of many people I love. So when I heard that there was an opportunity to open up conversations with young people through designing and delivering workshops on the topic of mental health, and also to help improve young people’s experiences of GP services, I jumped at the chance!“As a volunteer with YMCA Right Here I have been involved in developing relationships with local GPs. It has included visiting many GP surgeries around Brighton and Hove, and assessing how they could do better when it comes to mental health and young people.  It’s been really interesting to see the differences between surgeries, and to talk to professionals about what they think their strengths and weaknesses are.“I’ve also been involved in designing our new social media and mental health workshop, which will be added to the workshops we’re currently delivering in schools; ‘5 ways to wellbeing’ and ‘coping with exam stress’. I’ve loved getting to talk to school students about mental health.  It can be a challenging conversation, but one that is so important to have.“The thing I enjoy most about volunteering is our weekly meetings. Our coordinator, Jacob, and all the other volunteers are such a joy to work with, and seeing them is the best way to start the week.  I must be one of only a few lucky people who really look forward to Mondays!“It is hard to juggle volunteering with university work, societies, a part time job, and keeping up relationships with friends and family – especially when you throw anxiety into the mix! In order to keep on top of everything, I’ve had to get better at planning my time, and accept that most days will be extremely busy!  I’ve also been trying to be kind to myself if I don’t manage to do everything I want to – sometimes sacrifices have to be made.  It’s also good to have a lovely team of volunteers you can rely on to help you out if you need it.“I was proud to attend one of YMCA Right Here’s Walk and Talk events as a volunteer. It’s a free walking activity with a therapy dog designed for a small group of young people who experience social anxiety and isolation, or feel challenged by being in groups or meeting new people.  As someone who has experienced these things myself, I was really pleased that I was able, despite my own anxieties, to go and help to provide other young people with a supportive environment.  It was also great to meet Geoffrey the pug!“Mental health issues are real, valid, and should be nothing to be ashamed of! Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, and to be given the support they need.  Speaking out about mental health issues is really important in order to get help, but that can be hard to do if you don’t know how the people around you will respond.  That’s why it’s also really important to let your friends, family and colleagues know that they can talk to you.  Hopefully when we start speaking about mental health issues more often, and honestly, less people will feel alone in their struggles, and more people will feel supported, and able to seek help.“Volunteering is also a great way to make a positive difference. I would really encourage anyone who is passionate about mental health and young people to consider volunteering for YMCA Right Here! It’s an amazing opportunity to make change, meet friends, and gain skills.”Thanks Emily, and we’re delighted that you decided to get involved with YMCA DLG!Find out more about YMCA Right Here      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

I had suffered an illness which meant that I was very anxious and I didn’t want to go out.  I became basically agoraphobic and was depressed.  My friends were moving on with their careers and I felt lost.“My mum suggested I try Positive Placements and I was quickly matched with my mentor, Barney. We started to meet every week in a local café which I knew and felt comfortable in.“Shortly after I met Barney I got a job, working in KFC. However, I told Barney that my ultimate goal was to go back to study to do A levels or equivalent so that I could be on the path to my dream job – a journalist.“I was really disappointed when I realised that I could no longer study for free at college due to my age and if I didn’t have Barney’s support I wouldn’t have known which way to go next.“He went out of his way to look at alternative routes, calling people and helping me research. We eventually found Access Courses online.  I applied to study ‘Access to Humanities’ with English as my main subject coupled with secondary subjects of Psychology, Creative Writing and Journalism.  I had an interview and got in!  I can’t wait to start in September.“I can’t even say how much Barney has helped me. Before I met him I didn’t know where to turn.  He has never put pressure on me but has supported me, given me hope and the self-belief that I can achieve my goals.  I am so excited by the opportunity of my Access course and from there I plan to go to university and begin my career as a journalist.“Everything’s going really well at the moment. Thank you Barney and Positive Placements.”Find out more about Positive Placements here.*Name and photo have been changed to protect the identity of the young person      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

At that time he had made some suicidal attempts, and was regularly visiting a mental health ward.  He says, “When I first came to YMCA I didn’t want or expect change.  I assumed I would be just moved along and forgotten.  To be honest I felt I was on my way out.”Initially Nathan was in shared accommodation but found that a struggle. He was moved to a different YMCA hostel and once there was encouraged to meet with the Learning & Engagement worker who helped him to build a bike from donated spare parts.  During this time they talked about other opportunities.  The YMCA worker arranged a meeting for Nathan with the local countryside rangers who offered him regular voluntary work.Nathan continues the story, “Since then I have completed 500 hours as a volunteer.  I’m currently doing a Level 2 Diploma in Environmental Conservation and GCSE Maths. I have also received an award for Young Volunteer of the Year in my town.  I have achieved my own personal goal of not being re-admitted to hospital and I’m keeping on top of work and college.  My confidence has improved and I don’t feel as worried about things.”Looking ahead Nathan plans to complete his Diploma and GCSE courses and continue volunteering as a Countryside Ranger, hoping eventually to find full time employment. Nathan is now described as a hardworking, conscientious young man.  His employer and tutors only have positive things to say about him and his award as Young Volunteer of the Year was truly well deserved.As he says himself, “I have a structure and routine to my life now. I am busy most days – it’s so much better than being sat alone in my room with my thoughts.”His advice to other young people is, “Perseverance is key.”  Nathan is certainly proof of that.*Photo posed by model      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

When in school, he was spending a lot of time alone, avoiding the other children or becoming very angry with them and his teacher. One day he threw a chair across the classroom, followed by hiding away.Needless to say Caleb’s parents were extremely concerned about him; at home he was a happy and playful boy. He lived with both parents and his 12 year old sister who attended another school locally. His parents had a good relationship and Caleb spent time doing family activities, attending ‘Beavers’ and playing football with his father.  The family used to have a dog, who sadly died in the previous summer holidays while Caleb was away on a football trip.  His parents explained that Caleb only displayed signs of anxiety just before school, particularly on Sunday nights.Of course they had asked him about his reluctance to go to school and his attempts to run back home, but he became very angry and refused to talk.  His parents found it impossible to get him to ‘open up’ and they felt helpless, as he had always enjoyed school previously and this behaviour was all very new.Caleb’s parents found out about school counselling from his class teacher. She said it would offer their son a ‘safe place’ to talk and play, where he could try to work through his difficulties.When Caleb’s parents talked about the possibility of counselling, Caleb was quite reluctant initially, but also quite curious. He asked many questions about what would happen; What will I talk about? What is a Counsellor? Will anyone know I am going to counselling?Caleb’s parents met with the Dialogue school counsellor for an initial assessment. They were able to ask questions and find out about the school counselling service. The school counsellor discussed the confidentiality policy with the parents. The counsellor was able to gather some information about the family and anything else that could be important for the counselling work. The school counsellor also gave them information on other Dialogue family and counselling services.In the first session, Caleb cautiously came into the counselling room. He was pleased to see lots of fun things to play with; playdough, paint, games, puppets and a giant sand tray. The counsellor introduced herself and he sat down in a comfy chair with lots of cushions.  He noticed that it was really peaceful and he soon began to relax.  Over the session, he slowly began talking to the counsellor and describing all the things he liked to do.Over the next couple of sessions, Caleb was happy and keen to come to counselling. He had begun building a beach in the giant sand tray.  Each week he would come and add something new to the beach – an ice cream stand, lots of pretty pebbles, some sunbathing teddies and a crocodile.  The counsellor and Caleb talked about everything on the beach and what it meant for Caleb.  He began expressing his feelings, about sometimes feeling so angry he could ‘explode’, and then also very ‘sad’.On the fifth session, Caleb was happy to come in and start playing with his sandy beach.  The counsellor had brought in a new set of toys, figures and animals.  Caleb very carefully chose a big brown dog and placed him on his beach.  He began talking about ‘Roger’, his old dog, who had died.  He talked openly about feeling very sad he was ‘gone’ and also angry, that when Roger died, Caleb was away at football and didn’t get to say goodbye.Over time, Caleb began to talk freely about Roger, and how ‘guilty’ he felt for being away when Roger died.  He was able to use the brown toy dog to express his feelings; the counsellor encouraged Caleb to use role play in order for him to talk to Roger.  Caleb also expressed feeling anxious about coming to school, as he worried about ‘things happening at home’ when he was at school, learning and having fun.Caleb and the counsellor talked openly about death, loss and feeling angry.  He decided that he wanted to write Roger a letter to say goodbye.After nine sessions, Caleb talked about feeling less angry and much happier about coming to school in the mornings.  He was able to talk to his family about losing Roger and why he felt anxious about leaving the house.The counsellor felt that Caleb had really benefited from the safe space counselling was able to provide; he was provided with a safe relationship and some creative play so he could express his worries.  He was not alone with his grief and was able to slowly accept and understand the loss of Roger and move forwards.Find out more about our school counselling service here.*Name and photo have been changed to protect the child’s identity      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

She was able to speak about her worries over Charlie’s angry outbursts and of her fears that he was turning out ‘like his dad’. This was concerning to all parties because there was a history of domestic abuse. She had literally locked Charlie out of her house until she saw what she called ‘a change in his behaviour’. With the help of the mediator she was able to draw up a draft document that listed what she felt needed to happen before she would let him back in to the house.Later in the week the mediator met Charlie and talked to him about the meeting with Mum and showed him the document. The mediator recorded Charlie’s reactions and added his ideas to the document.  They were also able to start identifying what it was about events in his life that still upset him.  For Charlie it was crucial that trust was re-established and that it was safe enough for him to start rebuilding his relationship with his Mum.The following week the mediator, Charlie and his mum met on-site at school and were able to take it in turns to explore how each was feeling about the current situation. As well as being able to talk about their anger and frustration they also acknowledged their level of care for each other.Over the course of the next four meetings they both contributed ideas to the setting of new boundaries, made compromises and agreed a plan that they were going to trial for the next three months.By the end of that time Charlie had moved back to the family home, his school attendance improved, he had seen his GP to check up on his health and agreed to be referred into counselling. Find out more about the Youth Advice Centre here.*Name and photo have been changed to protect the identity of the young person.

Not mother, sister or even friend, just someone who has an interest in her as an individual.  And hopefully I show her that she is well worth being around.“I feel very strongly that a frightening amount of young people have no–one to whom they can turn for advice.  Either their family support network is inadequate or they have become estranged.  Or maybe they just need a supporter outside the family.“The power of being that someone to a young person is potent and precious.  I am blessed to be in a position to offer that to this young woman.  I have learned an awful lot about myself through mentoring her.  I do feel proud that in a small way, I have helped to set her on a more positive path.  It has not always been easy – and has definitely sometimes been a rollercoaster ride – but I wouldn’t swap the experience for the world. The chance to help shape a young person’s future is an incredible honour and I am grateful to the YMCA for giving me the chance.“In fact, I have got such a lot out of the experience that I am volunteering to take on another young person alongside my initial mentee.”We are very grateful to Louise and our other mentors – thank you for making a difference.Anyone interested in volunteering as a mentor for a young person can find out more here.  We are particularly recruiting in Guildford, Horsham and Mid Sussex.*Name and photo changed to protect the identity of the mentor and mentee      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

After being thrown out of her home she presented as homeless to the YMCA’s Youth Advice Centre  (YAC) where, following an assessment, staff were able to offer her a safe place to stay in YMCA accommodation.At this time Lucy faced a variety of challenges in her life. In addition to being ostracised by her family Lucy experienced homophobic abuse and was significantly affected by an undiagnosed mental health issue, alcohol misuse and prolific self-harming.YMCA staff liaised with mental health and substance use services to ensure that Lucy received the support she needed.  YMCA staff worked with Lucy to ensure she was safe and in a stable supported position from which she could begin to move forward in her life.This package of support provided Lucy with a stable platform from which she could start considering her employment options.

The programme works to recruit volunteers from the local community who receive training to become mentors to vulnerable and disadvantaged young people helping them to identify and take the steps required to access education, employment or training. Mentors work with young people to help them overcome the barriers they may face such as low self-esteem, lack of confidence, anxiety, lack of experience, skills or lack of qualifications.Since March 2015 44 volunteers have been recruited and trained to become mentors. Already the young people, most of whom live in our supported housing projects, are reaping the benefits with some getting a paid job, starting to attend full-time college courses or volunteering. A Positive Placements mentee says, “My mentor has been absolutely superb. We first assessed what my end goals were in terms of further education and have now moved on to the subject of how to get there. As I have a long term illness that affects my mobility, it has been valuable to have someone to talk to about it not controlling my life and being able to do what I want, which is to get into education. I have found this service extremely helpful in moving on and would recommend it to anyone.” A mentor says, “It has been a challenge at times but I have always been supported. As a result of our work together my mentee has secured full-time employment with training in exactly the area he wanted to get into. His participation in the project has been beneficial to him but equally, this experience has been very rewarding for me.” A Positive Placement manager says, “The success of this project is down to our amazing dedicated volunteers in the community who genuinely want to make a difference in a young person’s life. They give up their time to make a real difference which is appreciated by all the team and young people themselves. This project quite simply does change lives.”       More InfoSleep Easy 2017 – Hall of FameSleep Easy 2017 – an extreme challengeSleep Easy 2017 Registration FormSleep Easy for young peopleSleep Easy Sleepout 2016 – mission completeFeedback from Sleep Easy 2017Read Ben’s story and find out how we help young people like himYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

His contact with YMCA started him on his journey towards building a new life.*Name and photo have been changed to protect the identity of the young personAmeer came to the UK as an asylum seeker from Sudan. He had to leave Sudan because he was wrongly accused by the Government of collaborating with the West Sudanese rebels. Ameer spent 14 days in prison when he was just 21 where he was brutally tortured and beaten. When he was released from the prison he was still closely watched by the police and had to endure regular humiliation, beatings and torture. He was scared that sooner or later the police would find a reason to imprison him again. Scared for his life and future Ameer fled the country with the help of some family friends who smuggled him on to a French cruise ship. Ameer spent 23 days in a dark, cramped engine room without seeing the daylight and survived by eating dates.When Ameer finally arrived in France, he spent three months trying to get on to a lorry to come to the UK. Ameer didn’t want to seek asylum in France because he was worried that the French Government would deport him back to Sudan. He was arrested just after arriving in England and after spending a few days at a detention centre was sent to Glasgow. Whilst waiting for a decision on his asylum application Ameer was using the internet to find out more about the UK. He found a Wikipedia page about Brighton and fell in love with the city just by reading about it.When Ameer was granted asylum he scraped together all his savings and bought a train ticket to Brighton.After arriving in Brighton with no money and nowhere to go Ameer was sleeping rough on a bench in Palmeira Square until someone advised he should go to the council and ask for support. The council referred Ameer to YMCA DownsLink Group’s YAC service that is the first point of access for housing advice for anyone under the age of 26.The advice worker at YAC was able to offer Ameer a placement with Sussex Nightstop, a service that matches volunteer hosts with young homeless people on night-to-night bases.Ameer stayed with a range of hosts whilst studying English at college and doing a course to become a security guard.During this time, Ameer attended YAC general advice drop-in to get support on a range of issues. As he says himself, he felt safe with YAC knowing that if something happens they will offer support and advice.Eventually YAC were able to offer Ameer a place in one of YMCA DLG’s Empty Homes properties. Empty Homes is a scheme that brings empty properties back into use to provide affordable and safe accommodation to young people in housing need.On 15th February, Ameer moved into his own room in a flat sharing with four other young people. Now he has a safe base from where to build his new life in the UK. Ameer is looking for employment and has started an Access course, as he wants to go to university and study business and IT.

After being thrown out of her home she presented as homeless to the YMCA DownsLink Group’s Youth Advice Centre where, following an assessment, staff were able to offer her a safe place to stay in YMCA DLG accommodation.At this time Lucy faced a variety of challenges in her life. In addition to being ostracised by her family Lucy experienced homophobic abuse and was significantly affected by an undiagnosed mental health issue, alcohol misuse and prolific self-harming.YMCA staff liaised with mental health and substance use services to ensure that Lucy received the support she needed. YMCA staff worked with Lucy to ensure she was safe and in a stable supported position from which she could begin to move forward in her life.This package of support provided Lucy with a stable platform from which she could start considering her employment options. At this point that she was referred to the YMCA DLG’s Positive Placements project. Positive Placements matches a volunteer mentor with a young person who wants to be supported to identify and achieve the steps they need to take to access employment, education or training.Lucy and her mentor Chris began meeting on a weekly basis. In the beginning their focus was on building trust and rapport and starting to explore the steps that Lucy could take towards employment. With the support from her mentor and YMCA DLG staff Lucy was referred to a ‘return to work’ course from which she gained a work experience placement that has successfully led on to paid employment. Chris has supported Lucy every step of the way, being there when she needed support and encouragement.Chris describes her mentoring role as, “Being an ‘interested person’ in her life. Not mother, sister or even friend, just someone who has an interest in her as an individual and hopefully I show her that she is well worth being around.

They both used me as a weapon to get at each other with violent fights over who would see us and who owned what so I ran away when I was 14.I stayed at random people’s houses and dealt drugs to support myself. I ended up taking them myself. But in this vulnerable state I was abused whilst staying at one man’s house. Because I lived in a small town this soon got back to my family who took me back home but the damage was already done. I was addicted to heroin and taking other drugs to block out reality.Living with my Mum turned bad after the divorce. She started laying into me and I had a nervous breakdown. I was sectioned but the hospital took me off all my medication apart from methadone and kicked me out. I had nowhere to live, and a mental health problem with no support or medication.I started sofa surfing and sleeping rough until thankfully I was able to move into the local YMCA. They gave me two meals a day and a comfortable room to stay in. I got support from the Housing team and I was offered counselling. I lived at the YMCA for about two years, before moving on to live more independently at another YMCA property. I lived there for 18 months until I was offered a house by the local council. I’m now finished with drugs and working part time.If I hadn’t had a room at the YMCA then I don’t know where I would be today, probably laying dead in a gutter.”      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

In that time she has made the most of the fresh opportunities offered to her to change her life for the better.She recalls, “When I was still living at home I was struggling with my mental health, and there were frequent arguments with my family.  My Dad and step mum were breaking up, home life became very unsettled and in the end I was thrown out of the family home.“At that point I went to YAC (YMCA’s Youth Advice Centre in Brighton).  I knew they helped homeless people so I went to them for advice.  I had nowhere to stay although I knew a bit about the YMCA because I’d volunteered with one of their projects.“Anyway thanks to YAC I was offered somewhere to live in a YMCA hostel.  It felt safe and secure and gave me a base where I could start to get my life back on track.  I got a lot of support there, particularly with my mental health.  Through the YMCA and YAC I was able to access other services.“When I was made homeless I was scared about where I might end up, but with the support and high quality service I’ve received I had nothing to worry about.“I’ve also had some fantastic opportunities that I never could have imagined.  Last summer I went to Borneo with Raleigh International, to work and promote sustainable development in remote and poor communities.  Without YMCA support I would never have done that – it was a once in a lifetime experience and for that I’m truly grateful.“I’m really grateful for the opportunities I’ve had. I’ve been able to join the YMCA DownsLink Group’s Young People’s Board – we work towards getting the views and opinions of young people heard and considered by those higher up in the organisation.“In the future I’d love to work in probation, prison or youth work.  Meanwhile I’ll be spending this summer working with young people on the National Citizenship Scheme programme.  I am grateful to the YMCA for the support and opportunities given to me, which I believe have helped me to secure this work.”      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

From that point on she began to turn her life around.Alys missed quite a lot of school as a teenager, she recalls never being at school preferring instead to be on the streets. Looking back she describes herself as ‘mouthy’ and had several run-ins with the police.  At the same time she says, “I felt as if I had an underground sadness that I never thought I could conquer”.When Alys needed somewhere to live, a room at the Foyer was available.   At the time she wasn’t working, having been signed off sick, and the future was looking bleak.She started meeting with her key worker, and found their conversations really helpful. Her keyworker lent her a book about change, commenting, “Change doesn’t have to be scary”.Alys started studying for English and Maths exams – a challenge considering how much schooling she had missed, but with a new positive attitude she really began to pick things up quickly. When her keyworker suggested she try volunteering her first reaction was very negative.  She says, “In my mind volunteering was working for nothing…little did I know that giving my time would feel so good!”Alys has since gone from strength to strength, making the most of every opportunity presented to her. She moved on to live independently and secured a cleaning job back at the YMCA.  In her interview she made a lasting impression, saying she could do a better job than the existing cleaner!Alys had aspirations for the future. She says, “I wanted to work with kids with the same mentality I had so I can give back what I have learned.”  Alys has gone even further to realise this dream, by becoming an Engagement Worker with 16-18 year olds in a YMCA hostel.  She has done this through her own incredible resilience and determination, helped by the encouragement and support she received.  Her former keyworker is now her colleague – both of them are inspirations.

as a result I found private rented accommodation in Brighton.“In 2012, I came into contact with YMCA again but this time as a volunteer for the Right Here project.  I joined the Activities Team which helped to research, organise and facilitate activities for young people aged 16-25 who were experiencing emotional and mental health issues as well as social anxiety and/or isolation.“During my time in this role I helped to facilitate anger management courses as well as outdoor ‘walk and talk’ counselling groups.  I also had the opportunity to organise social events for young people with games, art, music, cooking and the chance to meet other young people in similar situations.  After some changes to Right Here at the end of 2013, unfortunately the activities team could no longer continue and it wasn’t until 2015 that I again became involved with the YMCA.“Last year (2015) I started volunteering at YAC working with the Support and Advice team.  They offer young people a space to talk about emotional well-being, get advice about education, work or training and general guidance.  During this time I developed my skills in working directly with young people, learning how to ascertain their needs and what possible solutions there are or how best I could help them.“One client I worked with briefly needed someone talk to about their emotional well-being and also identified issues with drugs.  It was one of the most difficult sessions I had co-worked and after asking questions and listening carefully to their story I wasn’t sure what to do next.  With the support of the Advice Coordinator, it was arranged that the client would come back for further support.  Following on from this initial session they felt listened to in a way which other professional support unfortunately hadn’t offered and they independently made a plan of what the issues were and how best to find a resolution.“Through these voluntary roles I had the opportunity to integrate with the team at YAC and across other parts of YMCA DLG.  Overall I had such a brilliant experience volunteering that it gave me the motivation and confidence to move into my current paid role as both a Receptionist and Housing Advisor for YAC.  I now offer housing advice to 18-25 year olds, which is the same service that was provided to me once upon a time ago!“My favourite part of this role is interacting with young people and it is really satisfying to see that young people leave the service with all the information they need to move forward with their situation.  What I have found most challenging in my role as a housing advisor is managing the expectations of young people and helping them to understand the options open to them, when often these can be limited.  I aim to try and empower young people to make the decision that is best for them.“I can’t express enough how important volunteers are to the organisation and as a young person I feel very empowered by my own progress, and I hope volunteers future and current see the value of this.  I hope my story is a good example of how a journey can progress over time and can lead to great opportunities.  I am very grateful for YMCA as a service that is open to young people both to support them and also allow them to be involved with how the organisation works.”We’re delighted to have Sam as a colleague!Find out more about the housing drop-in service at YAC here.

Unable to cope with being bullied, she dropped out of university, and when her relationship broke up she had nowhere to live.  But thanks to the opportunities she found at her local YMCA she has started to rebuild her life and is making positive choices about the future.Gwen’s first contact with YMCA was when she took part in a 12 week Prince’s Trust Team course. She found it helped her to decide what she wanted to do with her future, and subsequently she started on a nursing degree at university.  Unfortunately she was subjected to bullying, and after just six weeks she dropped out.  Gwen says, “I was OK until my relationship with my boyfriend broke up and I had nowhere to live.  At that point I spent about a month in a night shelter, having to leave after breakfast every day.  There was no one my age there and I really wanted somewhere safe to live.”She was offered a room in the local YMCA hostel. Although she was unsure of what to expect of hostel life, she was happy to move in with people her own age, and she knew some staff already because of the earlier Prince’s Trust Team course.  Over the following months she took advantage of the opportunities that came her way.  “When I first moved in I was really quiet and kept in the background.  But I found living here I could try new things.  There used to be an Art class that I really enjoyed.  And then last year I was able to go to Costa Rica with Raleigh International.  That was an amazing experience.  Since I’ve been here I’ve developed more confidence and I’ve learnt to be more assertive.”And what does the future hold for Gwen? She is moving out of the YMCA into her own accommodation, and she’s also raising funds to go to Tanzania in September with Raleigh International Citizen Services.  “I’m interested in overseas relief work.  I’ll be in Tanzania for about three months, and we’ll be working on sustainability and clean water projects for local communities.“I feel I’ve now got a vision for the future. I’m planning to go back to university to do a Nursing degree.  I’ve had great support here, and been given opportunities I never expected to have.  I would say to others don’t give up.  There’s always light at the end of the tunnel.  I could still be staying in a night shelter, but instead my life has really been enriched.”      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

Children and young people tend to find it difficult to engage at school if they have had stressful or distressing experiences or are experiencing emotional difficulties. They may struggle with their studies, or show their distress through difficulties they have relating to teachers or other pupils. Counselling can provide effective early intervention and prevention to enable students to manage their feelings and stress levels.  It is also effective in helping students address issues such as anxiety, academic work stress, and friendship issues.  In addition those experiencing bereavement, parental separation, loss of self-confidence, self-harm, eating disorders and substance misuse can benefit.Our own outcome evidence has been collected over 15 years of offering counselling in educational settings.  It demonstrates the very positive impact on a student’s capacity to achieve. We consistently find that students benefit in measurable ways from engaging with Dialogue services. We also found there was a 70% drop in exclusions.  Furthermore the number of students placed on internal disciplinary measures dropped by 67% whilst attending YMCA Dialogue sessions. *Rupani, Houghey, Cooper (2012). “The impact of school based counselling on young people’s capacity to study and learn”. British Journal of Guidance and Counselling      We have found that for students attending YMCA Dialogue sessions: • 86% reported improved ability to engage with learning • 84% reported an increase in their self-esteem • 84% reported greater stability or improvement in their emotional well-being • 100% said their sessions had been ‘helpful’ or ‘very helpful’ to themServices comply with the Department for Education guidelines ‘Counselling in Schools: a Blueprint for the Future’ 2015.We work in a diverse range of schools, including:Mainstream infant, junior and primary schoolsMainstream secondary schools and 6th form collegesSpecial needs schoolsFree schools and academiesIndependent schools“For so long you have offered me unwavering support, and I will always be grateful for that.

She subsequently used the YMCA Dialogue lunchtime drop-in.  During these times she reported that she was enjoying school more.  She also started taking much more of an interest in her school work and activities.If YMCA Dialogue can help you or someone you know please contact us.

There have been plenty of those telling him what to do.  My role is to listen, prompt, suggest, support and keep turning up.“As a mentor I have definitely developed better listening skills.  I believe I have a better understanding of the pressures faced by young people these days.  And I have a better understanding of the very complex and inflexible benefits system and associated red tape.“Mentoring has certainly been valuable for my own career development.  I have developed useful skills that I can use in every other area of my life.”Rachel concludes, “Some people volunteer to give something back, but for me the greatest reward is to be part of the process as a young person works to turn their life around.  When they are ready to move, that is when Positive Placements can be effective.”More information about Positive Placements can be found here.       More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

She gives frequent talks at our staff inductions and we hope she will become a young trainer, and begin co-delivering some of our training to staff and volunteers.Emily also recently won two regional Outset Volunteers awards for her outstanding volunteering in Horsham. Her next challenge is a trip to Tanzania to help build out-buildings and water sanitation units with Raleigh/ICS.Emily has immense courage and determination that is amazing. She regularly experiences issues with complex trauma but is so committed and reliable that she deserves recognition. Everyone at YMCA DLG believes she really deserves this Young Leader award as she is a true inspiration to staff and young people alike.

As a training and education project it sets out to support disadvantaged young people aged 16 – 25 years old to obtain education, employment or training. It achieves this by connecting young people with mentors in their local communities.  It then provides the support necessary for them to overcome their barriers and achieve their goals.This is achieved by recruiting and training local volunteer mentors and then matching them with a young person who needs support. The mentor and mentee meet at least once a week for at least one hour to identify the mentees goals and formulate step-by-step action plans to achieve them. The relationship continues for up to one year.Positive Placements is particularly innovative.  It unites YMCA DLG’s priorities of transforming communities, tackling youth unemployment and the positive impact of meaningful occupation. In addition, the support is one to one and tailored to a young person’s individual situation and needs. Not only can it support a young person’s readiness for work but can also enable them to:Build confidence & self-beliefDevelop & recognise their potentialGain new experiencesDevelop an understanding of their responsibility to their communityDevelop social skillsBuild work related skillsKey AchievementsPositive Placements has established strong partnerships for referral and signposting across our local area, being able to reach a diverse range of young people.YMCA accommodation servicesJob Centre PlusYouth Offending TeamsMid Sussex Think Family initiative for marginalised families, organisations working with youth and community groups.Work & learning groups, across local authorities YMCA Story:Lucy was struggling with homelessness and other issues – Positive Placements is making a difference.  Read more here.

YMCA DLG’s Empty Homes programme has seen 170 bed spaces created in Sussex over the past four years. It aims to assist local authorities with managing youth homelessness, and supported housing providers to move-on capable residents, shorten waiting lists at high support projects, as well as offer accessible and affordable housing for young people.The accommodation project is administered by the Homes & Communities Agency (HCA), whose funding enables YMCA DLG to lease property from private sector landlords by offering capital investment to pay for renovation. In return for this investment, the landlord agrees a minimum five-year lease with YMCA DLG. The local YMCA then uses this accommodation to provide low level supported housing with intensive housing management for single 18 to 35-year-olds and young families.YMCA DLG provides intensive housing management, mobile night workers, on call access, a dedicated housing worker, regular reviews, and support and understanding. Its Empty Homes scheme is currently running in Worthing, Brighton, Crawley, Horsham, Mid Sussex, and even on a farm! The most successful area of operation has been Hastings, where this scheme has created 80 new bed spaces for young people in housing need.So far, the Empty Homes scheme has provided housing for more than 200 people.  YMCA DLG plans to increase their housing stock further, as well as bidding for additional funding from the HCA to continue the scheme to 2021.YMCA Story:David was working as a chef when a life changing injury at work turned everything upside down. His normal life quickly unravelled but the YMCA Empty Homes scheme has helped him get back on his feet.  Read more here.

They are delivered in community settings and are available for all ages.      At YMCA YAC in Brighton donations go into a client emergency fund.  This fund helps to purchase bus passes or travel warrants for clients and interview outfits.  When the need arises it also funds sleeping bags and food, or every day clothes for those in real need.        YMCA Guildford was particularly fortunate last year as money raised locally led directly to setting up a new YMCA Positive Placements project.  This included employing a part time Positive Placements Coordinator, Sarah who is recruiting and training volunteer mentors from the local community.  She has now started working with our residents.Money raised in Horsham enabled young people to access interviews with travel money and interview clothes.  One young person embarked on further training as donations covered the college fees and equipment costs.  It has also funded volunteer recruitment and training costs.        Where funding for our WiSE project is under threat donations provide a lifeline. WiSE (What is Sexual Exploitation) does life changing work with children and young people at risk of or already subject to sexual exploitation.  Our WiSE workers also deliver invaluable training to professionals.  They are then able to identify and appropriately respond to signs of sexual exploitation.   In Brighton & Hove the generosity of local residents funded Christmas gifts for young people living in our housing projects.  A staff member’s cycling challenge resulted in the purchase of a new TV for a communal lounge.  Another donation funded blenders for the house to make healthy smoothies.            More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

Why?YMCA DownsLink Group provides accommodation for around 550 young people every night.  Most of these would otherwise be homeless and the purpose of the event is to raise awareness of youth homelessness.  This sponsored event also raises vital funds for our work.  This enables us to support young people into stable accommodation and meaningful employment.  Would your young people like to help us and make a difference?One night of rough sleeping cannot be a true taste of homelessness but it is certainly thought provoking. Where do the homeless spend a penny? How much can they carry around with them all day to then use to keep themselves warm and relatively comfortable at night? And once body parts are chilled, with no hot drinks at arm’s length, how do they ever feel warm again? And all this is apart from the added inconvenience of rain or the unwanted attention of passersby. How vulnerable can a person feel?  Surely this can’t be a lifestyle anyone would choose?The reality is that some young people find staying at home impossible. This may be due to a breakdown of family relationships, abuse or simply an abdication of parental responsibility – the reasons are as varied as the young people we encounter. Our staff do all they can to help young people overcome the problems they face.  Your young people may know someone affected by these issues, and if they don’t there’s a good deal of scope for discussion.  Young people raising funds to support other young people has something very poignant about it so do please encourage them to raise funds too – it’s very satisfying!What do I do now?Email communications@ymcadlg.org to let us know you want to sign up.  Then we will send you an entry pack which will give you more information about how to prepare for the event.  Remember, sleeping outdoors can be an extreme challenge especially if temperatures fall below zero, so this should only be undertaken by people with minimal health issues. The Sleep Easy Sleepout is a key element of our voluntary fundraising for our work. Please help to make it a success – there are so many young people who just can’t make it on their own. They need our help.       More InfoFeedback from Sleep Easy 2017Sleep Easy 2017 – Hall of FameRead Ameer’s story and find out how we help young people like him“I feel safe with YAC knowing that if something happens they will offer support and advice.”YMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

He underwent complicated surgery to reduce the chronic pain but still has only limited mobility in that hand.  During this time he was staying with his mother but their relationship was affected so badly that ultimately he moved out.David picks up the story, “The post-traumatic stress hit me and that affected my relationship with my mother.  Over time, my housing situation changed from staying with her to being homeless. I stayed in my car for three months, roughing it on the streets. I wanted to have somewhere to live.  I started eating less and my anxiety increased.  One of my biggest challenges was dealing with my worry; I would normally wake up at 5am and from that time I had massive worry about where I was going to stay that night.”Due to his deteriorating mental condition, he was eventually taken in to a local residential mental health service where people in crisis can find some respite.  After a short stay they referred him to the YMCA.The YMCA Empty Homes scheme brings empty rental properties back into use, refurbishing the property and then managing the tenancy on behalf of the landlord. Many properties have been made available to young people that would otherwise be standing empty.David says, “YMCA Empty Homes ticked all the right boxes.  Firstly, I could access support 24 hours a day.  Then, as soon as I met the Service Manager, he was on the ball; he showed the right attitude, full of information and with a complete understanding of my needs and the help I required.  I moved into my own place in March 2014.  My best memory is the day I got housed and I filled in the tenancy agreement.”David is still in a legal battle to bring closure to his accident.  He has to cope with day-to-day challenges like pain, medication, continuing medical checks and dealing with the legal matters involved in his court case.“I’ve had ups and downs over the last two years but the help provided by YMCA has been consistent and accessible – it’s been always there for me.  I’ve got my place, my privacy and I find the interaction very reassuring – they keep me informed and I know where I stand.  Changing from living in a car to a flat has been healthy.  I have been very lucky.“I’m not half as stressed as I used to be.  Living on my own has also given me a template for structure and routine.  In addition, it has laid the foundation for a better relationship with my mum.  There have been some important changes.  Now I have a home and my mental health is a lot better since I first got in contact with YMCA.  I’m realising I’m a much stronger person now.“I hope I can return to work in the future.  I’m looking into accessing new training and even into the possibility of a career change.  I’m grateful to the YMCA, without it my situation would be quite stressful and the future would be unclear.  There is no future in the past, now I’m looking forward.  And to any young person in crisis like I was I would say grasp the opportunity with both hands as the care the YMCA provides is so helpful.”David’s YMCA Empty Homes worker says, “I met David soon after he moved into YMCA Empty Homes.  His case is inspirational and he is a tremendous example of resilience.“David has suffered ups and downs in his mental health but he has found the strength to address issues and access the necessary help in order to make changes to improve it.  No matter how challenging his situation has been, he continues to always be polite and he has a welcoming approach.”David is looking forward to having his court hearing and putting an end to this difficult chapter in his life.  On this tough journey, David has gained a variety of skills and he has become more aware of his strengths and gained confidence.  We are delighted that YMCA Empty Homes has given him the fresh start and solid base that he needed and wish him every success in the future.

She tells her story.“Before I came to Crawley Foyer I was living at home with my Mum. We got on OK but not all of the time.  I needed my own space and if I had stayed I think it would have ruined our relationship.  It was time to stand on my own two feet and learn how to deal with money, and look after important things like paying the bills and finding work.“I had some friends already living in the Foyer and I thought it would help me to find work and improve my life skills.“When I first moved in I felt nervous but after a while I got used to it. I started going to the Job Club, and I benefitted from the key working sessions.  The YMCA has helped me learn how to pay bills and keep on top of things.“Now I am working full time at a travel insurance company and things have worked out really well for me. I lived at the Foyer for about 9 months, and then moved into a shared house.  I was then given a one bedroom flat.  And this year I was nominated to move into a brand new flat!  I am very lucky to be given a beautiful brand new home, I am really grateful.  Thank you to the Crawley YMCA Move On team for your support.”Jenny Burling has worked with Georgie for about three years and says, “It has been great to see her grow in confidence and self belief. Significantly Georgie has overcome problems with self-esteem, budgeting and finding employment.  She has had to deal with personal trauma in her family and friendship group and has become a confident young lady who is working full time and achieving the goals she has set herself.”As Georgie starts this new phase of her life we wish her every success. Photo shows Georgie collecting the keys to her new home.

This drives home how much more difficult this would be if I knew I didn’t have a way out. YMCA can be that way out for some reason.Hope is a powerful thing. Thank you.Across the four sites there was an amazing atmosphere of enjoyment and fun at the same time as appreciating what it meant to normally ‘sleep easy’ and to support those who the YMCA help.I feel humbled to have experienced my first Sleep Easy with such a wonderful bunch of people. The YMCA team were wonderful, friendly, supportive and very organised. When I put my cardboard down, being here alone, I felt a sense of vulnerability and it hit home what it must be like to face this on a daily basis.It was a really eye opening experience. It made me think about things I hadn’t even considered before about sleeping rough. Thank you for looking after us so well. The work YMCA do is indispensable.Sleep Easy was a great experience – I met loads of new, amazing people and feel like I understand a bit better what it is like to sleep rough. I’ll definitely be back next year!Fantastically fun night – a great sense of community. Although I had all my layers, tea and had a nice safe location, it really made me realise how hard it must be for people who sleep rough with barely nothing every night.Homelessness is not a joke, well done to all for the money raised.This was just one night; it made me more aware what every night might be like on the streets. Brilliant organisation and terrific hospitality.Great experience – will do it again for sure!What an experience – more than ever, I appreciate the roof over my head. I don’t know how the homeless cope or carry on – I don’t think I could.Great fun and friendly evening, fantastic way to fundraise and will be back next year.A privilege to be part of such a wonderful imitative to highlight such a diabolic society dilemma …. I look forward to taking part again next year, when I truly hope the situation has improved. Thank you.Feeling the cold, feeling at risk.I hope the money raised will help towards creating a society where no one sleeps rough.Such an amazing experience for such a worthwhile cause. Great team spirit, good insight into the YMCA’S awesome work!A real insight to sleeping rough and that was just for one night! See you next year!The YMCA’S work is vital in Brighton and Hove especially as crucial services continue to be cut back. A few hours of mild discomfort is a small price to pay to highlight such a valued institution.The experience was an eye opener, but only reinforced my belief that nobody should be homeless! The ‘Y’ does amazing work to see that it becomes an actual reality.A wonderful sense of community, purpose and solidarity. A great experience.A short sharp insight into the hardship of homelessness. Difficult to comprehend repeating the experience on a weekly/monthly/yearly basis.Sleep Easy is pivotal in making homeless issues relatable. Noise, hygiene, comfort, choice – we take them for granted. It was a sobering and unifying evening that will resonate in future social and political choices.It’s cold, but it’s worth it.It’s not a 5* hotel, it’s a million star hotel.First time! Made me think & raised some money for a good cause. See you next year.Excellent event. Worthwhile cause. Great experience with friendly people. HorshamIt certainly is fun to stay at the YMCA! Always a great opportunity to have a tiny insight into how tough it is to sleep rough.  I am more grateful than ever to get in to my bed.Cold! Should have used more cardboard!Superbly organised. This is a great event and worth doing to get a small taste of how it must be to sleep rough. My first comments on waking were – that was OK but I wouldn’t want to do it every night.What an experience. Despite not being a real reflection of rough sleeping it was still challenge enough.  In this day and age we need to do whatever we can to end rough sleeping.Why does everything smell of woodsmoke? Also we need more pens.I was grateful to have the company of positive people. I’m sure there are many street homeless people who feel very lonely.  I felt very fortunate that it was only one night.Good experienceEntertaining and worthwhile, very good experience. Would do it again next year.I was lucky that I only had to deal with the cold for one night, unlike others who have no choice but to endure it each and every night.I had a great time and enjoyed the evening. Thank you.It was one night that could make a difference to lots of nights for others. Great fun and nice people.I was freezing and knowing I had raised money for a good cause made it all worthwhile. Will be back next year.We did sleeping out ‘in style’ with plenty of cardboard and warm sleeping bags, but really brings home the misery of what it must be like to be homeless. Amazing work the YMCA does and very happy to be able to raise some money for the work they do.Great fun. Great people.  Great cause!  I hope I have helped to make a difference.Mind blowing experience. I enjoyed the evening, opened my mind about homelessness.  I myself have used the YMCA DLG services – without them I would have been lost and maybe taken a different path.  I’m a lucky one.Great event – really don’t know how people do this every night!Who needs an alarm clock when you have Judi Cox!I’m sorry to say the underfloor heating didn’t work.Gave me a deeper empathy for people who have to sleep rough.GuildfordIt definitely made me realise how horrible it would be to do this every night. I hope that our one ‘rough’ night can help others to move on with their lives.One night was enough for me. I definitely wouldn’t like to do it again tonight.  Fingers crossed our one night of cold can help many others.  What an inspiration the YMCA are. JI was very struck by:the dedications and enthusiasm of the YMCA teamthe sea shantiesthe beauty of the dawn breakingthe friendliness of everyone therehow awful it must be to do this night after nightI will remember the experience for a long time.Never slept in a box before…cardboard is surprisingly effective. A real blessing to have a home and not have to sleep out regularly.I wouldn’t like to be doing this every night but it was great fun with nice people.A wonderful experience, which was truly eye opening. It was an amazing experience and I had a lot of fun, but I definitely wouldn’t want to spend every Friday night this way!What an experience. I don’t know how people sleep rough night after night.  I would do it again as I feel so strongly about raising awareness of homelessness.  Well organised.It was great to have a large number this year. It was rather cold but dry.  I certainly would not want to be sleeping out constantly, particularly as an OAP.An amazing uplifting experience meeting likeminded people sharing the plight of the homeless. And particularly young people in a week when the security of our nation was shaken but not broken.  See you next year.Great experience. It made me realise how awful it must be to have to sleep like this every night and how lucky we are.  I hope our one uncomfortable night and money raised can help youngsters with YMCA help change their lives and help them to smile again.Thank you to each and every volunteer who took part and raised money – you are stars!       More InfoFeedback from Sleep Easy 2017Sleep Easy 2017 – Hall of FameRead Ameer’s story and find out how we help young people like him“I feel safe with YAC knowing that if something happens they will offer support and advice.”YMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

Volunteer chaplains usually help out every 2-3 weeks on rota basis. These evenings always have a relaxed atmosphere and allow the residents, who often have experienced deep trauma, to socialise and chat in a safe environment.These chaplaincy meals help the young people who live in our housing projects to feel they matter and to glimpse something of God’s love for them. They also help the young people to feel part of the wider community – to feel they belong.If you are interested in being a chaplain, or if you or your church could help to fund /support YMCA chaplaincy on a regular or one-off basis please get in touch.What the residents say about the Chaplaincy:I wish it was twice a week – on Mondays and Fridays – that would make for a good start and end to the week.It wasn’t what I expected …I like sitting round the table to eat and being able to talk…and we have a good laugh sometimes…It is nice to have someone to talk to just about day to day life and have a nice meal to eat. Gareth Stacey House Chaplains – Sue, Rob, Maggie, Lisa, Michelle and ShirleyLansworth House Chaplains – Fiona, Bob, Sarah, Mari, Clare and Mischa        More InfoChaplaincyBrighton & Hove ChaplaincyHorsham ChaplaincyWorthing ChaplaincyMeet the ChaplainsSupporting the Chaplaincy ServiceContact the Chaplaincy"When I have a difficult week it’s often chaplaincy I look forward too.

Supporting them. On the whole, we are known as the ‘Doughnut People’, and are there to chat, get to know the residents and staff, serve drinks and doughnuts, and be a listening ear to those who come to see us.  I pray that Chaplaincy sessions also enable the residents and staff to know and feel that they are a valued member of our wider community.  I have learnt so much from being a chaplain, about how building relationships with others leads to a better understanding of each other. We’re building a stronger community together. Judi Cox, Volunteer Chaplain CoordinatorIf you would like to explore becoming a volunteer chaplain contact Lucy McGrath, our Lead Chaplain at lucy.mcgrath@ymcadlg.org for more information.The YMCA Horsham Chaplaincy Team – (from left to right) David, Judi, Alex and AngieFeedback about the ChaplaincyChaplaincy was the first thing that helped me settle into the Y Centre socially. It was a nice common ground to speak to other residents. The team are lovely and non-judgemental. They have never forced Christianity on me which is a big relief to me. Also they are accepting of people who aren’t heterosexual so that makes me feel a lot less on edge when I am around them. I can’t believe I haven’t mentioned their doughnuts yet – their doughnuts are amazing! When I have a difficult week it’s often chaplaincy I look forward too. Some of them I see also as mentors. If I am having a rough time I can vent to them and they are always happy to see me and are welcoming.  Their being so welcoming also helps break down the barriers between the ‘them and us’ sort of thing. I was shocked when they said they actually enjoyed working with us. I think it makes us feel more wanted.   YMCA ResidentI think the Chaplaincy provide a very warm and welcoming, friendly evening of vibrant conversation, hot drinks and doughnuts. It is a valuable opportunity for residents to meet and socialise in a safe friendly environment.

We are an inclusive Christian organisation and our staff and young people are from all faiths and none.In order to help everyone understand chaplaincy we use the following words:A chaplain is someone, usually from a church or faith group, who wants to support people in their communities. There are often chaplains in hospitals, sometimes in schools and in all sorts of everyday settings.Our YMCA volunteer chaplains are here to offer support to residents and staff. The daily pressures of life can get to us all. Our volunteer chaplains are here to listen and to chat, and if you have worries, large or small, you can share them if you want to. Everything is confidential unless they are worried about your safety or someone else’s safety.They are also here to explore spiritual issues with you if you choose, and if you would like them to pray with you or for you, just ask. They will not try to convert you to their faith; they will respect what you believe. They are here for everyone, no matter what your spiritual beliefs or background.Our team of volunteer chaplains, led by our Lead Chaplain Lucy McGrath, help the young people who live in our housing projects to feel heard, valued and accepted and to glimpse something of God’s love. They support the young people to feel part of the wider community and to belong.The Chaplains work in teams and spend time with the residents in their projects, cooking with them, chatting, playing board games, and generally just being there for them.We currently have chaplaincies running in Brighton & Hove, Horsham and Worthing, with services in Guildford starting in 2017. We also have two volunteer chaplains who support our staff.To find out more about becoming a Chaplain or supporting the Chaplain Services at YMCA DownsLink Group click here.Read about the difference the Chaplaincy service can make here in Hayley’s story.

We can provide support to children and young people up to the age of 25 who need and want our help.  This might be through one to one work with a YMCA WiSE Project Worker, joint support with an existing professional involved in the child or young person’s life, group work or outreach.There are loads of different factors that might make someone vulnerable to an abusive or exploitative relationship or situation.  The sorts of topics we address include: body image, self esteem, friendships, family relationships, consent, rights and responsibilities, sexting, pornography, sextortion, online and smart phone safety, assertiveness, negotiating skills, sexual health, understanding positive and negative relationships, grooming and sexual exploitation.We also provide training and awareness raising workshops to schools, community and voluntary sector organisations, local authority teams, police, health practitioners and through the LSCB training programme. Click here to make a donation to support the work of YMCA WiSE      What are the signs? • Feeling pressured into doing things you don’t feel comfortable with; • Running away from home/care or not being where you should be, like school; • Offered money, alcohol, drugs, lifts, somewhere to stay or other gifts in exchange for sexual favours; • In a relationship with someone who tries to control what you do, who you see, how you spend your money, where you stay or other aspects of your life; • Being threatened, intimidated, manipulated or forced into sexual activity with your boyfriend, girlfriend or other people; • Meeting random people online and sharing lots of information or pictures.There may also be other things going on in a child or young person’s life which might make them vulnerable to sexual exploitation or exploitative situations.Spud’s WiSE Words **Please note that the telephone number at the end of this video is incorrect, please refer to contact details on this page** If you suspect anyone is in immediate danger, call the Police on 999.  If a child or young person is currently at risk of significant harm from CSE, refer immediately to your local Children’s Services.

Please complete the referral form as fully as possible.  It’s not just a checklist; we need to have as much information as possible in order to respond appropriately.  If you’re unsure you can call us to discuss.How long will it take? YMCA WiSE aims to respond to all referrals within 10 working days.  We are a small team working across Brighton & Hove and East Sussex and need to screen the referrals carefully so that those children and young people with the highest level of risk and safeguarding needs are responded to as a priority.  Urgent safeguarding matters need to be referred immediately to Children’s Social Care or the Police.How will YMCA WiSE support the child/young person? At YMCA WiSE we believe that where a positive relationship already exists between a child and a worker it is usually most appropriate for YMCA WiSE to support that worker in delivering work around sexual exploitation and relationships, rather than taking on a case ourselves.  Where a child has no such relationship with a worker and would benefit from specialist support from YMCA WiSE we may offer one to one work.  We can meet with a child to come up with a plan for the work, incorporating their own wishes for support with those from referring agencies and YMCA WiSE.Please be aware that this sort of work takes time.  It can only be effective when the child or young person has built up a relationship with the worker and begins to trust them.  Sexual exploitation sits within the broader context of relationships, family, self esteem, body image, assertiveness, rights & responsibilities, and can affect housing, substance use, offending behaviour, mental health, amongst other needs.  The work that we undertake at YMCA WiSE might involve supporting the young person with some of these other things before approaching the issue of sexual exploitation.  We want to work to build on their protective factors and behaviours in order to minimise their vulnerability and risks of being sexually exploited.  YMCA WiSE also works closely with a number of other agencies and services and it may be most appropriate to refer the young person elsewhere for the support they need.Engagement with the YMCA WiSE Project is voluntary; professionals cannot include YMCA WiSE as a compulsory part of a young person’s contract, order or conditional agreement.You must ensure that you have discussed a referral to YMCA WiSE with the child or young person and got their consent.  Contact your local YMCA WiSE office if you need support in explaining the role of the project to a young person.Training We deliver multi agency training through both Brighton & Hove and East Sussex LSCBs.  You can find details of upcoming events and booking information on their websites.  We can provide bespoke training and workshops to any organisation or team in East Sussex, Brighton and Hove or Surrey.  Please get in touch for more information on content and cost.East Sussex Local Safeguarding Children’s Board: www.eastsussexlscb.org.uk East Sussex LSCB also provides an e-learning module, available to all staff and volunteers supporting children, young people and families in East Sussex, click here to download.Brighton and Hove Local Safeguarding Children’s Board: www.brightonandhovelscb.org.ukUseful documents To be addedUseful links Sussex Police: information on CSE and how to report The Portal:  If you’ve been affected by domestic or sexual abuse or violence (or are working with someone who has) in Brighton & Hove  or East Sussex, get in touch to find out more about the help, advice and support available.

Through threats, bribes, violence, humiliation or by telling you that they love you, they will have the power to get you to do sexual things for their own or other people’s enjoyment.” (Nia Project)CSE is child abuse and the response should be the same as for any other safeguarding concern.How will I know if my child is at risk of CSE? Usually a child will not identify that they are a victim of CSE. We all need to be aware of potential vulnerabilities and risk indicators in order to protect children.What are the signs to look out for? – Going missing or regularly coming home late; – Regularly missing school or education; – Appearing with unexplained gifts or new possessions (often new mobile phones or SIM cards); – Associating with other children involved in exploitation; – Having older boyfriends or girlfriends; – Suffering from sexually transmitted infections; – Unusual changes in mood or behaviour; – Drug and alcohol misuse; – Displaying inappropriate sexualised behaviour; – Anything that strikes you as a concern—you know your child.If you are concerned about your child or a child in your care please contact your local support service.  Your concerns will be taken seriously.  All organisations have a shared responsibility to protect, safeguard and promote the welfare of children who may be/are being sexually exploited.What can I do to help? – Talk to your children about healthy relationships and consent – there are loads of resources around to help you start these sometimes tricky conversations.  There are some links in these web pages; – Learn about the risks that your child may face online and take practical steps to minimise these; – Children who are being sexually exploited need persistence, patience and consistency. – If you are concerned about a child or a situation say something!My child is over the age of 16, is there anything I can do? There are laws to protect children up to the age of 18 from CSE.   Even when they reach the age of 16 a child cannot consent to exploitation. Consent means having the freedom and capacity to choose.  Exploitation removes the freedom.  And anybody under the influence of drugs or alcohol does not have the capacity to consent to sexual activity.Can WiSE work with me? YMCA WiSE works specifically with children and young people rather than parents and carers.  However we will always do our best to support parents and carers in other ways; by directing them to appropriate services, providing useful links and resources, listening to their concerns, liaising with them where appropriate.  We stick to an information sharing and confidentiality agreement which states that we will only share information about the work we are doing with a child or young person with their agreement, unless there is a safeguarding or criminal issue, in which case we will contact children’s services or the police.  We cannot share information with you about your child without their consent.How do I report my concerns? If you suspect anyone is in immediate danger, call the Police on 999. If a child/young person is currently at risk of significant harm, including from CSE, refer immediately to your local Children’s Services:East Sussex Single Point of Advice (SPOA) team: 01323 464222 Opening hours: Monday to Thursday 8.30am to 5pm, Friday 8.30am to 4.30pmBrighton and Hove Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH): 01273 290400 Opening hours: Monday to Thursday 8.30am to 5pm, Friday 8.30am to 4.30pmSurrey Local Referral, Intervention and Assessment Services: North East area – Spelthorne, Elmbridge and Epsom & Ewell: 0300 123 1610 South East area – Mole Valley, Reigate & Banstead and Tandridge: 0300 123 1620 North West area – Runnymede, Surrey Heath and Woking: 0300 123 1630 South West area – Guildford & Waverley : 0300 123 1640 Opening hours: Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pmUseful links and resources Sussex Police: information on CSE and how to report PACE UK: Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation.

At YMCA WiSE we want to help children and young people stay safe in their relationships.  We want to make sure that you are safe and know how to recognise an abusive relationship or situation.  We do this by offering one to one support; someone to listen to you, make sure your voice is heard, talk about things like consent, self esteem, pornography, online issues, healthy relationships and grooming.  We can also help you access other services that you might need, like housing, drugs and alcohol services, sexual health and contraception.We’re not police or social workers; we are independent and no one can force you to work with YMCA WiSE.  When we first meet you we will talk you through our information sharing policy.  That’s the bit where we say that we won’t share the details of what we talk about with anybody else unless we have your permission, or we feel that someone is at risk of harm (either you or someone else).Are you or your friend: • Feeling pressured into doing things you don’t feel comfortable with? • Running away from home/care or not being where you should be, like school? • Offered money, alcohol, drugs, lifts, somewhere to stay or other gifts in exchange for sexual favours? • In a relationship with someone who tries to control what you do, who you see, how you spend your money, where you stay or other aspects of your life? • Being threatened, intimidated, manipulated or forced into sexual activity with your boyfriend, girlfriend or other people? • Meeting random people online and sharing lots of information or pictures?If the answer is yes to any of these then we want to hear from you – either by phone, email, facebook or using our contact form on this website.  Sometimes this is called sexual exploitation.  It doesn’t always happen in the same way.  Sexual exploitation can happen to both boys and girls and the person exploiting you can be of any age and could be male or female.  Have a look at these videos to see some examples of what we mean:Me, Jenny and Kate Jay Consent If you feel forced, threatened, blackmailed, manipulated or tricked into any type of sexual activity then even if you said “yes” you cannot consent to sexual activity.  This is because you didn’t feel that you had a choice.  Consent means having the freedom and capacity to choose.  And you also can’t consent to sexual activity if you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  It doesn’t matter if you are over the age of 16.  This is important to remember if someone is pressuring you to have sex or if you want to have sex (or any other sexual activity) with someone else.Here are 2 videos that help explain it: Consent – Just Like Tea! Laci Green – Consent 101 Sexting Sharing sexual texts, photos of videos might seem pretty common but there are a few things worth knowing.  The most important thing to do if something has happened is to talk to an adult you trust.‘So you got naked online?’ talks through sexting, what it is, what to do if you’re worried about something you’ve shared (whether deliberately or accidental), and what you can do to keep safe online.CEOP (Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre) can also help:Exposed by CEOP       More InfoYMCA WiSEYMCA WiSE – Children & Young PeopleYMCA WiSE – Parents & CarersYMCA WiSE – Multi Agency ProfessionalsThe YMCA WiSE TeamYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

As a result, they may find it difficult to engage with formal programmes due to a variety of reasons, including  a lack of confidence, distrust or insecurity.We have designed a series of programmes and interventions which have ‘mindset’ at the core and are delivered by staff that the young people trust. Our dedicated and skilled staff aim to reach those who, with the right support, could realise the huge potential within them.Our employability offer aims to address a series of knowledge gaps and assist in a responsive manner by tapping into the interests and learning styles of the young people we work with. We are building a series of accredited and non-accredited options, both internally and in partnership with other providers, to give our young people the skills to not just succeed, but to thrive.We are always looking for partners who can help us deliver a responsive and needs based service, be that through funding or volunteering.For enquiries or partnership information complete an enquiry form or email apprenticeships.learning@ymcadlg.org.       More InfoAlternative EducationApprenticeshipsEmployabilitySocial Enterprise ServicesStudy ProgrammesYMCA Positive PlacementsEnquiry FormYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

Safe Space is run by staff from YMCA DownsLink Group and volunteers from the British Red Cross. Together the team ensures that people are provided with the physical and emotional support they need.

I have never been that drunk before and I’m feeling very embarrassed by the state which I allowed myself to get into. You guys are doing an amazing job by helping people, and I honestly don’t know what would have happened to me if you weren’t there for me. I can’t thank you all enough.” “I came into Safe Space very distressed on Saturday night and a lovely member of your team really helped me after I lost all my friends and had no idea where I was.

That first evening I was trying to watch a programme on the computer in the entrance hall but Judi (volunteer chaplain) kept talking to me. In the end I turned the computer off and went over to the chaplaincy group for a chat. The free doughnuts helped too – especially at first!“After that I popped down to see them most weeks. To be honest it made the hostel feel more like home. It wasn’t just the doughnuts, talking to them each week has made me feel less lonely. Looking back I felt quite isolated when I first lived here and I feel less lonely now. As well as meeting the chaplains it gave me the chance to get to know other residents too.“As well as that it’s been good to know that someone notices how you are. I get on great with my keyworker and meet with her regularly but sometimes it’s good to get a different opinion. There have been times when I’ve been struggling and I’ve appreciated being able to share that with the chaplains, I feel they have heard my pain.“I know they will be there each week – that really helps particularly if I have had a bad week. Having someone who is happy to see me makes me feel better – and it’s a chance to hang out with other residents too. And we love the free doughnuts!“Where religion’s concerned I grew up thinking God was ashamed of you and you need to work harder, rather than thinking there’s a God who loves me. I’m not sure whether I believe in God or not but it has shown me that there is a side of Christianity which is more accepting.

There are often chaplains in hospitals, sometimes in schools and in all sorts of everyday settings.YMCA volunteer chaplains are here to offer support to residents and staff. The daily pressures of life can get to us all.  Our volunteer chaplains are here to listen and to chat, and if you have worries, large or small, you can share them if you want to.  Everything is confidential unless they are worried for your safety or someone else’s safety.They are also here to explore spiritual issues with you if you choose, and if you would like them to pray with you or for you, you can just ask. They will not try to convert you to their faith; they will respect what you believe. They are here for everyone, no matter what your spiritual beliefs or background.Hayley continues, “Where religion’s concerned I grew up thinking God was ashamed of you and you need to work harder, rather than thinking there’s a God who loves me.

He says, “I’m passionate about working with young people.  When I heard about the YMCA I felt there would be a good fit between how I work and how the YMCA works.  Having an impact on young people’s lives and looking to help them from all angles – socially, emotionally and practically, and accessibility is important.  Young people can access the YMCA.”“I wanted to volunteer because when I was young I had strong mentors and adults I could relate to for advice and emotional support. I want to offer this to another generation.  The YMCA seems to be really thoughtful in how that support is delivered.”Mark now volunteers as an Honorary Counsellor, working one day a week as part of a counselling team. He has noticed demand on the counselling service increases around exam time.  Young people can be struggling to cope with many aspects of life, from social pressures to global issues, family life or general anxiety.  A significant pinch point is the notion that making the wrong decision now will impact the rest of life.Mark finds the work rewarding and meaningful. “It’s great to see the change in the young person over ten sessions.  Maybe there’s a decrease in anxiety, or identifying the root of their distress.  I enjoy offering them a safe space to do this, and being on that journey with them.  For myself, I find I feel less alone, more connected to people which is really important to me.  You meet people from all walks of life and come to understand the ‘human struggle’ is universal.  It has been so rewarding to witness a change take place in a young person that I have helped with, and he is able to take that change into the world outside.”In conclusion Mark says, “I think my work at the YMCA has a massive impact on young people’s lives, and they support me in supporting them. I feel held and looked after, so as a placement for someone in training it feels like a safe and fertile ground in which to start my practice.” Find out more about Dialogue here.

I would really encourage anyone who is passionate about mental health and young people to consider volunteering for YMCA Right Here! It’s an amazing opportunity to make change, meet friends, and gain skills.”Emily first became involved with YMCA DownsLink Group in September 2015 when she joined a YMCA Right Here volunteer group. YMCA Right Here is a youth-led project based in Brighton and Hove that aims to promote and improve the mental health and wellbeing of young people.  Emily says, “Mental health has long played an important role in my life, and in the lives of many people I love. So when I heard that there was an opportunity to open up conversations with young people through designing and delivering workshops on the topic of mental health, and also to help improve young people’s experiences of GP services, I jumped at the chance!“As a volunteer with YMCA Right Here I have been involved in developing relationships with local GPs. It has included visiting many GP surgeries around Brighton and Hove, and assessing how they could do better when it comes to mental health and young people.  It’s been really interesting to see the differences between surgeries, and to talk to professionals about what they think their strengths and weaknesses are.“I’ve also been involved in designing our new social media and mental health workshop, which will be added to the workshops we’re currently delivering in schools; ‘5 ways to wellbeing’ and ‘coping with exam stress’. I’ve loved getting to talk to school students about mental health.  It can be a challenging conversation, but one that is so important to have.“The thing I enjoy most about volunteering is our weekly meetings. Our coordinator, Jacob, and all the other volunteers are such a joy to work with, and seeing them is the best way to start the week.  I must be one of only a few lucky people who really look forward to Mondays!“It is hard to juggle volunteering with university work, societies, a part time job, and keeping up relationships with friends and family – especially when you throw anxiety into the mix! In order to keep on top of everything, I’ve had to get better at planning my time, and accept that most days will be extremely busy!  I’ve also been trying to be kind to myself if I don’t manage to do everything I want to – sometimes sacrifices have to be made.  It’s also good to have a lovely team of volunteers you can rely on to help you out if you need it.“I was proud to attend one of YMCA Right Here’s Walk and Talk events as a volunteer. It’s a free walking activity with a therapy dog designed for a small group of young people who experience social anxiety and isolation, or feel challenged by being in groups or meeting new people.  As someone who has experienced these things myself, I was really pleased that I was able, despite my own anxieties, to go and help to provide other young people with a supportive environment.  It was also great to meet Geoffrey the pug!“Mental health issues are real, valid, and should be nothing to be ashamed of! Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, and to be given the support they need.  Speaking out about mental health issues is really important in order to get help, but that can be hard to do if you don’t know how the people around you will respond.  That’s why it’s also really important to let your friends, family and colleagues know that they can talk to you.  Hopefully when we start speaking about mental health issues more often, and honestly, less people will feel alone in their struggles, and more people will feel supported, and able to seek help.“Volunteering is also a great way to make a positive difference. I would really encourage anyone who is passionate about mental health and young people to consider volunteering for YMCA Right Here! It’s an amazing opportunity to make change, meet friends, and gain skills.”Thanks Emily, and we’re delighted that you decided to get involved with YMCA DLG!Find out more about YMCA Right Here      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

I had suffered an illness which meant that I was very anxious and I didn’t want to go out.  I became basically agoraphobic and was depressed.  My friends were moving on with their careers and I felt lost.“My mum suggested I try Positive Placements and I was quickly matched with my mentor, Barney. We started to meet every week in a local café which I knew and felt comfortable in.“Shortly after I met Barney I got a job, working in KFC. However, I told Barney that my ultimate goal was to go back to study to do A levels or equivalent so that I could be on the path to my dream job – a journalist.“I was really disappointed when I realised that I could no longer study for free at college due to my age and if I didn’t have Barney’s support I wouldn’t have known which way to go next.“He went out of his way to look at alternative routes, calling people and helping me research. We eventually found Access Courses online.  I applied to study ‘Access to Humanities’ with English as my main subject coupled with secondary subjects of Psychology, Creative Writing and Journalism.  I had an interview and got in!  I can’t wait to start in September.“I can’t even say how much Barney has helped me. Before I met him I didn’t know where to turn.  He has never put pressure on me but has supported me, given me hope and the self-belief that I can achieve my goals.  I am so excited by the opportunity of my Access course and from there I plan to go to university and begin my career as a journalist.“Everything’s going really well at the moment.

He didn’t come to watch me but he did turn up after the show had finished.  I asked him if he would come to the party but he said, “No,I’m here to pick you up and that’s it.”  That was the first time that I asserted myself and said “No!” to him.  I stayed there at the party until the end and I said goodbye to my friends properly.  I was proud of myself for saying no.It wasn’t until I spoke to my friend who said, “This isn’t normal, you need to get some help.”  I knew that I had to get out of my relationship but I couldn’t see a way out, I was too scared of what he might do to me.About this time my keyworker at the hostel told me about the YMCA WiSE project.  She said that it might help me move on and get over stuff.  I thought it couldn’t hurt and so a week later I met Gemma (YMCA WiSE Project Worker) and she told me what the Project was about and how they could help me and that kind of stuff.  Gemma didn’t have time to take me on so she asked Helen (YMCA WiSE Project Worker) to get involved.I actually broke up with my ex-boyfriend before I started meeting with Helen.  I felt relieved that he wasn’t part of my life anymore but he was still constantly emailing, calling, and texting me.Meeting with Helen once a week, we talked a lot about the stuff that was going on and also about what happened during the relationship.  I started to realise that I wasn’t actually aware of how serious the abuse that I experienced had been.  Helen helped me to see that it was never my fault, it was always his fault because he is what they call a ‘game player’.  He knew how to latch on to me and keep that bond alive.  Helen gave me lots of advice on how to move on and stay single, which has been quite a hard goal for me.  I’ve learnt to let go of the relationship and to be myself.Helen has always been lovely to me.  She understands and listens to me.  She has different perspectives and experiences and relates so much to what I tell her.  Helen has helped me to set some goals in my life to help me stay more focused.  We made my career the focus of my life and nothing else.  Working with Helen has been a wakeup call and it has let me think about myself for a change.I am looking forward to moving into my own place soon so that I can live independently and get out of the hostel.  I’ve also got two jobs working in bars in the evening.  Before I’d never go out at all but these days I’m going out more with my girls and stuff like that.  I’ve got a lot more friends now and I’m still single which is all groovy.  Actually I’m starting to be me again, I’m coming to life.My performance career is off to a flying start and I’m finally getting back with Glyndebourne and getting on with my career.  I’m an opera singer, a dancer, an actor and an acrobat, which is fun but a lot of work.  I’m doing a dance project at the moment and there is a show in three weeks’ time.  I can’t wait!  I have also been offered a lead role next year, paid work this time!  And I finally got onto the books of an agency in London.  They’ve given me a role in ‘Snow White’ in December which is good, a bit scary but hey ho.  I’m finally focusing on what I want to do.  I’ve been training for opportunities since I was three years old which is like 17 years and I’m not giving up now.  I’m literally almost there and I am so excited about it.  It is literally about to go off!The YMCA WiSE Project has helped me to get to grips with reality rather than living a fake life.  I recognise that I have always ended up in relationships with men who exploit me and I’m trying to break that pattern.  I’ve learnt to be myself again rather than being a character.  These days I’m definitely more wary with regards to guys. I can now read the signs, who is a decent guy and who is not.  Who is playing games and who is actually being a real person.  I can tell the difference now, which is good.If I saw one of my friends going through what I went through I would tell them that they have to go and talk to somebody and take a second to stop and breath and think about what they’re doing and what they actually want.  My advice would be that you need to review the relationship and understand what it is that he is giving to you and what you are giving back.If it isn’t equal then it’s not going to work out.  Are you being taken advantage of?  Is he making you do sexual stuff you don’t want to?  Is he taking your money or your time or not letting you see your friends?  Are you treated right some days and then completely ignored the next?  If so, he’s probably not the right person for you.  If it feels like he is in control of the relationship that’s not right.  You should both be in control of it and you should both be living your own lives.At the end of the day you have to put yourself first.  You always come first and if that isn’t the case then why are you with him?  Think about it and then make a choice.  If it’s not worth it then get out while you can.  That’s my advice.Read more about YMCA WiSE here.*Name and photo changed to protect the young person’s identity      More InfoYMCA WiSEYMCA WiSE – Children & Young PeopleYMCA WiSE – Parents & CarersYMCA WiSE – Multi Agency ProfessionalsThe YMCA WiSE TeamYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

At that time he had made some suicidal attempts, and was regularly visiting a mental health ward.  He says, “When I first came to YMCA I didn’t want or expect change.  I assumed I would be just moved along and forgotten.  To be honest I felt I was on my way out.”Initially Nathan was in shared accommodation but found that a struggle. He was moved to a different YMCA hostel and once there was encouraged to meet with the Learning & Engagement worker who helped him to build a bike from donated spare parts.  During this time they talked about other opportunities.  The YMCA worker arranged a meeting for Nathan with the local countryside rangers who offered him regular voluntary work.Nathan continues the story, “Since then I have completed 500 hours as a volunteer.  I’m currently doing a Level 2 Diploma in Environmental Conservation and GCSE Maths. I have also received an award for Young Volunteer of the Year in my town.  I have achieved my own personal goal of not being re-admitted to hospital and I’m keeping on top of work and college.  My confidence has improved and I don’t feel as worried about things.”Looking ahead Nathan plans to complete his Diploma and GCSE courses and continue volunteering as a Countryside Ranger, hoping eventually to find full time employment. Nathan is now described as a hardworking, conscientious young man.  His employer and tutors only have positive things to say about him and his award as Young Volunteer of the Year was truly well deserved.As he says himself, “I have a structure and routine to my life now. I am busy most days – it’s so much better than being sat alone in my room with my thoughts.”His advice to other young people is, “Perseverance is key.”  Nathan is certainly proof of that.*Photo posed by model      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

This year’s theme is the ‘Summer of Love’, which marks the 50th anniversary of the de-criminalisation of homosexuality in England and Wales.With 200,000 participants and spectators in the parade, this is great opportunity for YMCA DLG to show support to LGBT people in a bid towards a more inclusive community where people feel free to be themselves, to express their love and to feel like they belong.So in addition to being an opportunity to participate and celebrate the vibrant LGBT community in Brighton and Hove, there is also a serious side and we are celebrating how fortunate we are to live in a country where LGBT people are not criminalised because of their sexuality.YMCA DLG have almost 100 people participating in our pride parade entry including staff, friends, family, service users and their friends and family. Many thanks also to Liam Russell Architects, Griffith Smith Farrington Webb LLP  Solicitors, Tullett Self Drive and Peter Jeffrey who are supporting us with our entry.We have some really talented and creative people helping us create our float, without whom none of this would be possible. This year we are taking inspiration from the 50th anniversary and making costumes and designing a float that has a golden and 60s theme. The Beatles released the album Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967 and we are hoping to recreate the iconic album cover….with a little artistic licence!With only a few weeks to go, everyone is getting more than a little excited….the most important thing on everyone’s minds at the moment is ..

When in school, he was spending a lot of time alone, avoiding the other children or becoming very angry with them and his teacher. One day he threw a chair across the classroom, followed by hiding away.Needless to say Caleb’s parents were extremely concerned about him; at home he was a happy and playful boy. He lived with both parents and his 12 year old sister who attended another school locally. His parents had a good relationship and Caleb spent time doing family activities, attending ‘Beavers’ and playing football with his father.  The family used to have a dog, who sadly died in the previous summer holidays while Caleb was away on a football trip.  His parents explained that Caleb only displayed signs of anxiety just before school, particularly on Sunday nights.Of course they had asked him about his reluctance to go to school and his attempts to run back home, but he became very angry and refused to talk.  His parents found it impossible to get him to ‘open up’ and they felt helpless, as he had always enjoyed school previously and this behaviour was all very new.Caleb’s parents found out about school counselling from his class teacher. She said it would offer their son a ‘safe place’ to talk and play, where he could try to work through his difficulties.When Caleb’s parents talked about the possibility of counselling, Caleb was quite reluctant initially, but also quite curious. He asked many questions about what would happen; What will I talk about? What is a Counsellor? Will anyone know I am going to counselling?Caleb’s parents met with the Dialogue school counsellor for an initial assessment. They were able to ask questions and find out about the school counselling service. The school counsellor discussed the confidentiality policy with the parents. The counsellor was able to gather some information about the family and anything else that could be important for the counselling work. The school counsellor also gave them information on other Dialogue family and counselling services.In the first session, Caleb cautiously came into the counselling room. He was pleased to see lots of fun things to play with; playdough, paint, games, puppets and a giant sand tray. The counsellor introduced herself and he sat down in a comfy chair with lots of cushions.  He noticed that it was really peaceful and he soon began to relax.  Over the session, he slowly began talking to the counsellor and describing all the things he liked to do.Over the next couple of sessions, Caleb was happy and keen to come to counselling. He had begun building a beach in the giant sand tray.  Each week he would come and add something new to the beach – an ice cream stand, lots of pretty pebbles, some sunbathing teddies and a crocodile.  The counsellor and Caleb talked about everything on the beach and what it meant for Caleb.  He began expressing his feelings, about sometimes feeling so angry he could ‘explode’, and then also very ‘sad’.On the fifth session, Caleb was happy to come in and start playing with his sandy beach.  The counsellor had brought in a new set of toys, figures and animals.  Caleb very carefully chose a big brown dog and placed him on his beach.  He began talking about ‘Roger’, his old dog, who had died.  He talked openly about feeling very sad he was ‘gone’ and also angry, that when Roger died, Caleb was away at football and didn’t get to say goodbye.Over time, Caleb began to talk freely about Roger, and how ‘guilty’ he felt for being away when Roger died.  He was able to use the brown toy dog to express his feelings; the counsellor encouraged Caleb to use role play in order for him to talk to Roger.  Caleb also expressed feeling anxious about coming to school, as he worried about ‘things happening at home’ when he was at school, learning and having fun.Caleb and the counsellor talked openly about death, loss and feeling angry.  He decided that he wanted to write Roger a letter to say goodbye.After nine sessions, Caleb talked about feeling less angry and much happier about coming to school in the mornings.  He was able to talk to his family about losing Roger and why he felt anxious about leaving the house.The counsellor felt that Caleb had really benefited from the safe space counselling was able to provide; he was provided with a safe relationship and some creative play so he could express his worries.  He was not alone with his grief and was able to slowly accept and understand the loss of Roger and move forwards.Find out more about our school counselling service here.*Name and photo have been changed to protect the child’s identity      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

She was able to speak about her worries over Charlie’s angry outbursts and of her fears that he was turning out ‘like his dad’. This was concerning to all parties because there was a history of domestic abuse. She had literally locked Charlie out of her house until she saw what she called ‘a change in his behaviour’. With the help of the mediator she was able to draw up a draft document that listed what she felt needed to happen before she would let him back in to the house.Later in the week the mediator met Charlie and talked to him about the meeting with Mum and showed him the document. The mediator recorded Charlie’s reactions and added his ideas to the document.  They were also able to start identifying what it was about events in his life that still upset him.  For Charlie it was crucial that trust was re-established and that it was safe enough for him to start rebuilding his relationship with his Mum.The following week the mediator, Charlie and his mum met on-site at school and were able to take it in turns to explore how each was feeling about the current situation. As well as being able to talk about their anger and frustration they also acknowledged their level of care for each other.Over the course of the next four meetings they both contributed ideas to the setting of new boundaries, made compromises and agreed a plan that they were going to trial for the next three months.By the end of that time Charlie had moved back to the family home, his school attendance improved, he had seen his GP to check up on his health and agreed to be referred into counselling. Find out more about the Youth Advice Centre here.*Name and photo have been changed to protect the identity of the young person.

Not mother, sister or even friend, just someone who has an interest in her as an individual.  And hopefully I show her that she is well worth being around.“I feel very strongly that a frightening amount of young people have no–one to whom they can turn for advice.  Either their family support network is inadequate or they have become estranged.  Or maybe they just need a supporter outside the family.“The power of being that someone to a young person is potent and precious.  I am blessed to be in a position to offer that to this young woman.  I have learned an awful lot about myself through mentoring her.  I do feel proud that in a small way, I have helped to set her on a more positive path.  It has not always been easy – and has definitely sometimes been a rollercoaster ride – but I wouldn’t swap the experience for the world. The chance to help shape a young person’s future is an incredible honour and I am grateful to the YMCA for giving me the chance.“In fact, I have got such a lot out of the experience that I am volunteering to take on another young person alongside my initial mentee.”We are very grateful to Louise and our other mentors – thank you for making a difference.Anyone interested in volunteering as a mentor for a young person can find out more here.  We are particularly recruiting in Guildford, Horsham and Mid Sussex.*Name and photo changed to protect the identity of the mentor and mentee      More InfoGet InvolvedWork For UsVolunteer For UsFundraiseFundraise through your businessDonateOpportunities for Young PeopleChaplaincyYMCA Shops in the DownsLink Group areaYMCA DOWNSLINK GROUP Registered Address: Reed House, 47 Church Road, Hove, BN3 2BERegistered No: 3853734 Registered Charity No: 1079570 Registered Social Landlord No: 4644

This now presents an exciting opportunity to establish a strong and robust organisation that can offer a greater range of expanded and improved services to meet the needs of their beneficiaries; local children, young people and their families.  Through the merger, YMCA DLG’s larger capacity, greater sustainable efficiencies and expanded expertise means that their services will only be getting bigger and better, and will serve more young people and families than ever before. With the planned retirement of the current Chief Executive later in the year we are actively seeking his replacement to lead the next stage of the Association’s development.The Association has ambitious goals for the future but these must be carefully considered and proportionate given the significant challenges surrounding the need to secure a sound financial basis for the Association and to establish viable and sustainable funding; this against the ever-changing political, economic, social and technological environment.Reporting to the Chair of Board of Trustees you will provide inspiring entrepreneurial leadership at all levels within the Association, the communities it serves and the wider YMCA Movement.  You will play a pivotal role in realising YMCA DLG’s ambitions whilst broadening the scope and impact of their strategic contribution to the welfare and development of young people.   There is opportunity to develop closer links with some other YMCAs in the region and with YMCA England – the national council of YMCAs in England – through national initiatives.We seek a highly committed and capable leader who has the necessary gravitas, business acumen, diplomacy and emotional intelligence in order to operate with influence, both directly and indirectly, across a diverse stakeholder landscape.  You will be accustomed to having led and managed significant change.  You will be equally at ease ‘winning people over’ at local governmental and grass-root levels, and comfortable with the responsibilities of public accountability.  Externally to the Association, the post holder will need to be confident in their abilities to gain the attention and respect of local council leaders, regulatory bodies, the media, religious and community leaders, donors, funding organisations and senior representatives in other voluntary and statutory organisations at national levels.To apply please email: rg@warrenpartners.co.uk – quoting reference RAGP4919 – enclosing CV and a supporting letter.  For an informal and confidential discussion concerning this exceptional opportunity, please call our advising consultants – Rupert Gibb or Stephanie Clarke – on 0845 261 0600.YMCA DLG is an equal opportunity employer.

The service will cater for young people at Tier 2 level of mental health need (who are not engaging with traditional mental health services or do not make CAHMS threshold) by offering ‘youth friendly’ activities that appeal to those who perhaps may be put off by conventional or traditional forms of counselling or mental health support.We are seeking a family counsellor with experience of working with families and young people (13 years+) for our ‘Family Food & Mood’ activity.Family Food & Mood is a 4-6 week activity comprising psycho-educational and therapeutic family work structured around a practical skills activity – cooking. Strategically used, task sharing activities (e.g. chopping, stirring) can provide an external focus that can lighten the intensity of emotional ‘work’, which some young people (and/or parents) can struggle with for sustained periods of time. This can help reduce tension and help family members to talk about emotional issues feeling safe and contained, whilst simultaneously collaborating with each other around a shared practical task.Criteria: Qualified family counsellors or qualified counsellors with experience of family work. Experience of carrying out assessments required.Commitment: Each ‘Family Food & Mood’ activity sees 2 families (2-6 people max) working with a counsellor in tandem (start times for each family may be staggered). You will need to commit to approx. 2-4 hours weekly over a period of 4-6 weeks. Food/equipment is provided.Time/duration: Sessions could be held on Saturdays or weekday evenings and last between 1-2.5 hours.
