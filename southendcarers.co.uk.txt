Welcome to Southend Carers Hub

 










 







Do you care for a loved one with an illness or disability? We've made it easier to get the support you need.
Carers in Southend-on-Sea have often had to struggle through a maze of information and services to get the help they need.
Southend Carers Hub is a new partnership of six specialist local charities who have joined together to create a one-stop-shop for carers.
By working together we can make it much easier for carers to access the right practical, financial and emotional support.

About us


Southend Carers is an independent charity run by and for carers. We help carers get the support they need – whether that’s financial, practical or emotional.
Our staff and volunteers are either carers themselves or experienced care professionals. That means we always put the needs of carers first.  Our mission is to make life easier and fairer to carers in the Southend Borough.
We understand that when it comes to caring, one size does not fit all. Our expert information and advice is always tailored to your individual situation.  Whether you are caring for a neighbour, a loved one, a child or an elderly relative we are here to support everyone in a caring role that lives in the Southend Borough so please do register with us.
We send out quarterly Newsletters which contain really important information and advice for carers as well as any events we are planning in the future.  We have a dedicated Outreach Worker who is out and about in the community and is more than happy to give advice and help you work through the process of a getting a Carers Assessment.  If we feel there are other organisations out there that can offer more specialised support in your caring role we are happy to pass these details on too.

What is a carer?


A carer is anyone who cares, unpaid, for a loved one who is disabled or seriously ill. Carers can be any age and come from all walks of life and cultural backgrounds.
There are many reasons why people may need caring for: it could be a physical disability, learning difficulty, mental health condition, long-term illness, frailty, sensory loss, eating disorder or substance misuse problem.
If you provide support to a relative, partner, friend or neighbour who could not manage without you, then you’re a carer.

Adult Carers


If you are an adult over 18, you could be one of the 1 in 8 adults currently providing unpaid care and support to an elderly, disabled or seriously ill family member or friends.
Carers experience many different caring situations. A carer is anyone who cares, unpaid, for a friend or family member who – due to illness, disability, a mental health problem or an addiction – cannot cope without their support.
To care safely and maintain their own physical and mental health and well-being, carers need information, support, respect and recognition from the professionals with whom they are in contact. Improved support for the person being cared for can make the carer’s role more manageable.
What Adult Carers could be doing?

giving emotional support
helping someone cope with a mental health problems
cooking and cleaning
personal care, like washing and going to the toilet
budgeting and looking after finances
giving medicine or providing medical care
interpreting for someone who is deaf or who does not have English as their first language
reading information and filling in forms for someone who has literacy or concentration difficulties.

We know that although rewarding, caring can sometimes leave you feeling isolated.  We run Active Carer Sessions that are held at Clarence Road Baptist Church every other Thursday between 1 and 3pm.  We also run a 2nd Wednesday Club at the same venue  which will give you a chance to try out some new activities and meet other local carers for a cuppa and a chat.
We are here to offer support to any carers that live or have a cared for that lives in the Southend Borough.  If you feel you would like to register with us please do give us a call on 01702 393933 or email us at info@southendcarers.co.uk.  You can also download our Registration Form and send it back to us freepost.  Once registered with us you will receive our quarterly Newsletter which will detail future events that we are holding and any information that we feel will be helpful to our local carers.

Parent Carers


Parents and carers of children and young people (0-25) with additional needs.
Some children and young people have special educational needs (SEN) and these differing needs mean varied levels of support are required at different times.
Parent carers are most likely to be caring the longest. The responsibilities may be even greater in the situation of a carer who is a sole parent who has more than one person to care for, or if the carer has a disability or is frail aged.  Your caring role can change drastically over the years as your child gets older and bigger so it is important to have your caring role reassessed if you feel that it is changing. If you haven’t already thought about having a Carers Assessment this might be something worth looking into and we have lots more information here
We aim to provide a range of support to the family so that they can enjoy social opportunities alongside their peers and other families.  We are currently funded to offer family activities for parents of children with additional needs.  We try to organise at least one trip a month and some of our previous trips from last year are listed below. Take a look at our Family Carers 2016 Events sheet below and please register with us to access our trips.

Stubbers Activity Day
Maldon Promenade Park
Bike-Ability & Picnic
Chessington World of Adventures/Thorpe Park
Family Holiday to Havens Leisure Park
Halloween Krafty Kids
Family Christmas Party

We do understand the impact that caring for a child with additional needs can have on the family.  Many families that are registered with us have other children who are also helping to care for a sibling.  If you have another child (aged 5-18) within your family that also helps to care for your child with additional needs they can access our Young Carer’s Project which will give them a chance to meet other Young Carers at the various events that we hold.  For more information about our Young Carer’s Project take a look at this.
It is crucial that we are offering support to any carer in the Southend Borough.  We do appreciate that keeping a carer healthy is key in any caring role. We offer a free helpline and are happy to talk through any concerns you might have.  Where appropriate we will signpost you to alternative agencies and we also offer a FREE counselling service with a trained counsellor.  We offer 1-1 counselling sessions, or if you would prefer you can join our group sessions.  If you would be interested in accessing our counselling service, please give us a call on 01702 393933 or email us at info@southendcarers.co.uk. We also arrange regular events which many carers have found really information and useful.
If you aren’t currently registered with us feel free to download our Adult Registration, Young Adult Carer and Young Carer registration forms here.  You can send these back to us FREEPOST and once on our database you will be sent out a Welcome Park which will include our latest Newsletter and all the events that we have planned in the near future.  Some of our previous events included:-

Manual Handling Course
Carers Rights Events and information day including talks from Dee Gordon, Citizen’s Advice Southend, Carewatch and a Young Adult Carers representative.
Carers Get Together Coffee Morning
Stress & Mood Management course in partnership with Therapy For you and Southend Borough Council.
Preparing for the Future Workshop in partnership with Citizens Advice Southend and Project 49.  David Crabb gave advice about Wills, Power of Attorney, Discretionary Trust and Wish Letters.  This was an oversubscribed event and we are keen to get carer’s views on what other subjects they would like information about.
Caring Safely Workshop is designed for any carers who live or have a cared for that lives in Southend and will be held on 8 March 2016.  This will be a practical, informative and friendly workshop for carers who want to stay healthy and avoid slips, trips, sprains and strains.

Young Carers


It is estimated that there are approximately 177,000 identified Young Carers who are children and young people under the age of 18, who provide some level of unpaid care to another family member. And they can sometimes be as young as 5 years old.
Young Carers are children and young people under 18, whose lives are restricted in some way because of the need for them to give care to another person (usually a family member) who is ill, has a disability, is experiencing mental ill health, is affected by alcohol or drug misuse, or HIV/AIDS.
And the difference between young carers and other young people who help in the home is that young carers are often responsible for someone else in their family – in a way that most other young people aren’t.
What Young Carers could be doing? 

Domestic tasks washing, shopping, cooking, cleaning
General care, giving medicine, assisting with mobility
Intimate care washing, bathing
Childcare – looking after brothers and sisters
Emotional support listening, helping other family members to feel OK

What’s the effect?

Feeling “different” and isolated from their friends / peer group
Lack of time for homework, play, sport or leisure activities
Feeling that no-one understands or listens
Conflict between their needs and those of the person for whom they are caring, leading to possible feelings of resentment Health problems including headaches, stress related illnesses, lack of sleep, stress, anxiety
Underachievement at school

What support do we offer Young Carers?
We offer FREE monthly events and activities to our Young Carers and offer Saturday Club activities for children aged between 5 and 18 years who look after a parent or sibling with an additional need.  For an idea of our previous trips, take a look at the Young Carer Saturday Club Activity Form 2016
Recent events have included:-

Sailing Holiday
Young Carer’s Festival
Adventure Island
Southend United Football Club

We don’t receive any statutory funding for any of these activities and they have only been possible because of the continued support of our volunteers and the generosity of local groups and businesses who have so kindly supported us.
We would like to say a huge thank you to:-

Olympus Keymed
Heritage Trust
Inner Wheel
Leigh & Thorpe Bay Rotary
Masons
Halifax Building Society

We have secured donations in 2015  from Leigh Lions for the Saturday Club  and Leigh Rotary having also generously donated for the following year and the Young Carers Festival.
The Friends of The Forum fundraising team are continuing to hold events to support ALL the Forums’ activities for adults and children, supported by Stuart Cloke, a local fundraiser who has helped support many charities over the years.
We would not be able to run these events without your support and generosity so we owe you all a big thank you.
Please let us know if you would like to make a kind donation by emailing us at info@southendcarers.co.uk

Young Adult Carers



Young Adult Carers are between the ages of 18yrs – 25yrs, and look after a relative or friend, of any age, due to disability, chronic/terminal illness, mental health problem or an alcohol or drug addiction / dependency.
It is estimated that there are 229,318 Young Adult Carers aged 16-24 in the UK and this is 5.3% of all people in that age group.
What issues do they face?

Conflict between needs of the cared for and their own needs.
Lack of recognition, praise or respect.
Problems juggling education, training, employment and home life.
Tiredness/difficulty concentrating.
Lack of time for social activities.
Problems moving into adulthood (finding work, their own home and establishing relationships).
Not having much free time – leisure and recreational opportunities are limited
Stress and anxiety issues

We are very lucky to have on board a Young Adult Carer mentor, Dani Brown who herself is a carer and is aware of the impact caring can have on a young adult.  The Young Adult Carers group meets every Wednesday at The Forum, Southend Library from 6-7.30pm and they can offer great support.  They arrange various activities and have great fun.  Meeting other carers in a similar situation can be a great way of knowing that you’re not alone as they understand the restrictions and impact it can have on lives.  Carer to carer support can also be a great way of sharing experiences and supporting each other when times get tough. If would would like to know more about the work we do with Young Adult Carers take a look at this flyer
If you know of a Young Adult Carer or are a Young Adult Carer who would be interested in joining the group, please give us a call on 01702 393933. Alternatively, you can ring the mobile number on the flyer above.

Carers Assessments



 
Carers may be entitled to receive additional help and support for their own needs from the Local Authority. The carers’ assessment is carried out by Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, Adult Social Care Access Team to try and establish the needs of an individual who requires help from social care services and to arrange services to meet their needs.
Giving unpaid care and support to someone with an illness or disability is a challenge but it can also be a fulfilling experience so long as you realistically consider your own health and wellbeing and receive the support you need.
Whether you are a child or an adult, caring for someone on you own or sharing care with other family members/friends and whether you are living with the person you care for or care from a distance, you are entitled to a Carers Assessment.  Everyone’s situation is unique and a Carers Assessment gives you the opportunity to consider your caring role with someone from the social care team to look at the impact the care you provide is having on other aspects of your life and to take control of the situation.  A support plan may be put in place following a Carers Assessment which could for example help you to keep active, have time for family and friends, relieve stress and help you stay in work alongside caring if that is what you hope to achieve, or to maybe learn a new skill while you are staying a home full time.
As a result of a Carers Assessment you could be awarded a carers budget; an amount of money to help support you while you are providing necessary care.  A Carers Assessment does not include a financial assessment.  Sadly Carers Allowance did not go up in the 2016 budget so still remains at £62.10 per week.
How to get a Carers Assessment
You are entitled to a Carers Assessment even if the person you care for does not receive social care.  To properly assess your situation the Council will need to know some details of the person you care for to understand the level of care you are providing.  To have your Carers Assessment provided by Southend Borough Council, the person you care for must live within the borough of Southend on Sea even if you do not live in the borough yourself.  Southend Carers can make a referral for you to access a carers assessment or you can refer yourself by phone or email.  The contact details are as follows:-
Telephone Southend Borough Council on 01702 215008 (option 1)
Email: accessteam@southend.gov.uk
You will need to give the name, address and date of birth of the person you care for so your details can be matched up.  If Southend Borough do not currently have information on the person you care for you will need to fill our social care assessment information for the person you care for so that the access team understand that level of care you are providing.  If you, the carer and the person you care for both want an assessment you can have them take place together or separately. Either way, you should have an opportunity to talk to the Social Worker on your own.
Preparing for a Carers Assessment
It is a good idea to think about how your caring role impacts on your life; your physical and mental health but also impacts on your relationships with friends and members of your family.  This can include thinking about whether you are becoming isolated and/or feeling that your confidence has taken a knock.  Consider also whether your caring role gives you concern about working or taking part in training, education or volunteering.  The assessment will aim to understand what is important to you, encourage you to recognise your own strengths and skills and explore opportunities available to you in the community.
On a good day when everything is running smoothly you may not remember how you are affected on a more difficult day.  In winter, you may not think about situations which happen mainly in the summer such as going to outdoor activities and vice versa.  It is a good idea to keep a journal for a couple of weeks so you can remember and take a more considered view of what support you could benefit from.  It might be helpful to talk things through with family, friends and/or other carers as they may be able to suggest some useful support you would benefit from which you hadn’t thought of or was even unaware existed.
You may find that if you keep a journal for a week or two it will help you take a note of things to mention at your Carers Assessment.
The Carers Assessment
A Social Worker from Southend Borough Council will arrange a time to visit you and discuss the impact your caring role is having on you.  The areas covered are:-

your physical health
your mental health
taking time out
work
education/learning
finances i.e do you want advice on benefits

The Social Worker will also discuss with you whether you want to continue to be a carer.  Ask for an opportunity to speak to the Social Worker on your own even if you are having a joint assessment with the person you care for.
You may not be a superhero but take up the support available and you can achieve great things.
We have a dedicated Outreach Worker who can refer to Southend Borough Council for a Carers Assessment if this is appropriate.  If you need more information about this service feel free to give us a call on 01702 393933.
Carers Emergency Respite Scheme (CERS)
Southend-on-Sea Borough Council’s Carers Emergency Respite Scheme has been set up to help Carers plan for situations when an unexpected or sudden situation arises where the carer is unable to continue with their caring role. This could be for example:-

if a carer is taken ill or has to go into hospital unexpectedly and is unable to continue with their caring role
if a carer is caught up in traffic or has an accident
if another family member suddenly has an accident/illness and the carer needs to travel to be with them

These are just some examples of when the Carers Emergency Respite Scheme can be used.
Who can use the Scheme?
Anyone who provides care on a regular basis to an adult or older person and who lives in the Southend Borough can use this service.  The person you care for will receive support to manage at home.   There is no charge to use the service. The Respite Scheme is free of charge and can offer up to 48 hours (72 hours on a Bank Holiday) of free care.
How does it work?
The carer should contact Ashley Care who will send out a registration form which Carers will need to complete.  Their telephone number is 01702 348142, www.ashleycare.com.  This form can help carers identify what help they might need in an emergency and what help friends or family can offer so they can be contacted.  If friends and family are not able to offer any care, or there aren’t any friends or family around, Southend on Sea Borough Council has commissioned Ashley Care to provide a “short notice back up” service for carers to call on if they need to.  The support on hand will vary from practical hands on support to telephone support and advice or drop in visits as appropriate for every individual.
Once you have registered you will be sent a Welcome Pack which will include an emergency card that carers can keep safe in their purse/wallets etc.  You will also be sent a copy of your records and be invited to reassess the situation every year to ensure that your cared for details are current and accurate.
There is more information on this scheme on the link below.

 We are always here to offer support so please do give us a call on 01702 393933 if you need further advice or information about these services.

Benefits advice/support & Your Employment



Finding out what benefits you are entitled to can be very stressful.  We know that for many of our carers it isn’t always easy to get out and leave their cared for at home to attend appointments etc.  We hope that the following information will be helpful to anyone that is currently in a caring role, and is a little unsure about what financial and practical help they might be eligible to.  Here is a brief outline but if you need more detailed information you can always contact your local Citizens Advice or use Entitledto.com which is an online benefit calculator.
Carer’s Allowance is the main benefit for carers. If you are looking after someone for 35 hours a week or more, you may be eligible.  You don’t have to be related to or live with the person you care for.
Carer’s Allowance is paid at £62.10 a week (2016/17 rate). The amount paid is usually increased each April.
Carer’s Allowance is taxable. However, carers will only have to pay tax if they have other sources of taxable income such as an occupational pension or earnings. Carer’s Allowance on its own is below the threshold for paying tax. It is not means-tested – in other words not based on your income or savings – but earnings may affect your entitlement. It is not based on your National Insurance record.
Carers and Your Employment
In the future most people’s lives will include at least one episode of unpaid caring.   Many do not see themselves as carers as they are still at work and maybe sharing care with other family members and /or friends.  When someone close to you is ill, you just get on with it and don’t stop to think how the change in responsibilities is affecting you. However if you are juggling caring for someone with work and family, it is essential you consider your own health and wellbeing.  Awareness of this has even been written into the Care Act 2014. Register with Southend Carers  and let us provide you with information, advice and support so you can look after yourself as well as provide the care you want for your loved one.
Continuing to work whilst caring can help maintain an income and pension rights, and provide you with an interest and social interaction outside of your caring role.  If you’re finding it difficult juggling two jobs; your paid employment and your unpaid caring responsibilities, staying in work or returning to work might feel like a daunting prospect.
If you are looking to combine caring and work you may get some help by having a Carers Assessment, or getting a review of an existing Carers Assessment.
Carers Personal Budgets can be used to improve your own work opportunities. Southend Carers can offer more information and there are fact sheets on the Southend Borough Council website.
The statutory employment rights that are particularly relevant to carers to help you stay in work while caring are:

the right to request flexible working
the right to time off in emergencies
the right to parental leave if you have a child
the right not to be discriminated against or harassed under the Equality Act.

If you are self-employed, on a short-term contract or employed through an agency you may not be covered by these rights. If this applies to you it is important to seek advice.
All employees with 26 weeks of service have a statutory right to request flexible working. Your employer must consider your request reasonably and have sound business reasons for turning down your request. If you tell your employer why you would like to work flexibly you are more likely to identify a working arrangement that works for both you and your employer.
Part-time working, job sharing and flexi-time are well known examples of flexible working but other solutions such as homeworking, shift swapping, annualised hours or compressed hours with employees working their hours over fewer working days could be a solution to a problem in covering care responsibilities. It is always worth discussing possible options.
 
How do employees make a request for flexible working?
In addition to your statutory rights your employer may offer more support. For example you may be able to use leave arrangements, paid or unpaid to cover intensive periods of care. If you are thinking of giving up work some employers offer paid and/or unpaid career breaks, often after a specified period of service with them. If this is possible it allows you to keep your options open, ensuring you can go back, and keeping you in touch with the workplace.
Help to Start Work or Re-train
Jobcentre Plus offer Work Focussed Support For Carers to carers who are aged 18 or over, work less than 16 hours a week and cannot get help from any other Jobcentre Plus employment support programme. It is a voluntary service which you can choose to take part in at any time. A Jobcentre Plus personal adviser can give help and support including;

Help preparing for work
Help to find suitable training
Support in looking for and applying for a job
Funding for replacement care

Carer counselling service



Being a carer is a uniquely demanding and important task. Most carers have times when they are troubled by personal or family problems. We may turn to friends and family to support us, but sometimes we need more than this. That’s when it may help to talk to a counsellor, who will listen to you and hopefully help you untangle your feelings and thoughts.  We operate a revolving door policy, as carers issues are usually ongoing, enabling them to re-access the service if they feel they need to in the future.
Some people say counselling helps because they can talk about anything they want in a safe and non-judgemental environment. When people talk with their counsellor over time about the things that feel overwhelming, they often find that things become more manageable.  Here are some testimonials from carers that have used our service:-
Client A says: “I like the realisation that most of the carers are going through similar emotional difficulties and it helps to chat to them, normalising our situation to a degree”.
Client B says: “This is a vital service for carers as it provides neutral ground to discuss your fears and anxieties.  The sessions have helped me understand that my current feelings are linked to the past.”
Our carer counselling service offers 7 counselling sessions. This service is FREE for any carers that live in the Southend Borough or have a cared for that lives in Southend. For further details about this service click on this link.  Counselling has been beneficial to carers who have a limited support network.
We have a fortnightly group for carers who wish to talk to the other carers in confidence and share their experiences, views and ideas/tips etc.  Refreshments are offered and the group is facilitated by our qualified counsellor.  Our services are subject to regular in house Supervision and External Clinical Supervision.
Please call 01702 393933 or email counselling@southendcarers.co.uk if you wish to contact our Carer Counselling Service.

Advocacy service


Advocacy is there for those who feel they are being ignored, excluded, unfairly treated, or are not getting the sort of help they think they need.
We provide a free, independent service to all Carers living in Southend who have Carer related issues.

Leave a gift in your will


A gift in your will to Southend Carers can be the most powerful way to support local carers who provide unconditional and unpaid care for  a loved  one. All gifts, whatever size, will offer vital support and will really help us build a better future for carers.
What is a legacy?
A legacy is a special gift left in your Will because it is a gift to charity, this means it is exempt from tax, so it may reduce the amount of inheritance tax for which your estate is liable. All gifts, whatever size, will provide us with vital support. It might be a gift of a few hundred pounds, an item of jewellery, stocks and shares, or an endowment from a memorial fund. Whatever you can afford to leave us – it all counts.
Writing a will
Writing a will is essential to enable you to provide for the people and causes you care about. We understand that your loved ones come first. All we ask, is that once you are happy that you have taken care of your family, you consider our work.
It’s easy to include a gift to us in your Will. However, you should always consult a professional, such as a solicitor or financial adviser.
If you already have a Will, updating it to include a gift to us is quick and straightforward. If you don’t already have a solicitor, you can find one by visiting www.lawsociety.org.uk.
