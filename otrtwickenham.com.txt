OTR celebrates certification as  ‘NHS Your’re welcome’ status Posted on December 30, 2009  by  Dan




Deborah and Laura receive  NHS Youre’re  welcome status on behalf of OTR

‘Off The Record’ in Richmond upon Thames were commended for their youth friendly approach at a ceremony in the House of Lords. 

Local GP practices, sexual health services, pharmacies, hospitals and services in schools and Further Education settings have been taking part in the new Department of Health ‘You’re Welcome’ programme which works to improve health services for 11-19 year olds and ensure they can receive appropriate healthcare whenever they need to.
The programme aims to:

help young people to access the best health services to meet their needs
engage with young people early on, to help them feel comfortable using health services for the rest of their lives
strengthen strategies to improve teenage health including reaching vulnerable and marginalised groups

By 2020 health services regularly used by young people across the country will be expected to take part in the programme. The government has invested £4.5million in a national roll out, so that all young people – regardless of where they live – are able to access services best suited to their need.
The Rt Hon Dawn Primarolo, Minister for Public Health, said:
“The ‘You’re Welcome’ programme in Richmond upon Thames is doing fantastic work to help children and young people feel comfortable and confident visiting doctors’ surgeries, hospitals and other health services.
“Tackling inequalities remains a top priority across government. This important programme helps young people to get the support and advice they need to keep them fit and healthy.”
Criteria for Your’re welcome
The You’re Welcome quality criteria have been designed to be applied to all health services – both young people specific and general – covering general and acute health problems, chronic and long-term disease management (such as specialist care for asthma and diabetes) and health promotion. They are:

Access
Publicity
Confidentiality and consent
Environment
Staff training, skills, attitudes and values
Joined-up working
Monitoring and evaluation, and involvement of young people
Health issues for young people
Sexual and reproductive health services (SRH)
Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) – this section is focused on targeted and specialist services for young people on psychological wellbeing and mental health.

Celebration Event
The Celebration Event was hosted by Baroness Massey of Darwen, currently Chair of The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA).

Marina Lim raises £300 at Midnight swim challenge Posted on May 13, 2014  by  Dan


Well done Marina Lim who raised a fantastic £300 for OTR.

Marina braved the cold weather at 12 midnight on 23rd December 2013 to swim 10.8 km at Hampton Open Air Pool. Despite never having swum above 5 km  previously, she accomplished it in 4 hrs 26 mins, although reported not having been able to get warm!


Marina with her swim partner, Sue, who kept her going throughout the challenge

 
THANK YOU to everyone of you who have supported me in this challenge. I can report back to confirm that I have accomplished it – 4 hrs 26 mins. The last 90 lengths was hard as I just could not get warm, however hard I try to swim. Sue and myself kept each other going. There were over 14 Masters talking the challenge of 10.8 K and not to mention our Coach who did the 24 hours swim and completed 1900 L (over 68Km) and the children as young as 8 swimming the 24 hours relay.
Here is the   Everyclick.com page  for this event.

We raised a fantastic £1,100 thanks to your kind contributions!

Quiz and Wine tasting fundraising event Posted on March 23, 2015  by  Dan  | 

Leave a reply 



Event date: Friday 15th May, 7 PM
Event venue: St Mary’s Church Hall, Twickenham


Quiz and wine evening

Off the Record Twickenham is running a Quiz and Wine Evening on Friday 15th May at St Mary’s Church Hall, Church St, Twickenham. This fun event will start at 7pm with a wine tasting of five wines from the award-winning Doran Vineyards followed by a Ploughman’s supper of cheese, pate, bread and fruit. During the evening there will be several rounds of a not too fiendish quiz as well as a raffle and a cash bar for those who want to continue to drink the wine after the wine-tasting session.


wine tasting

This is an opportunity for friends to come as a team of 6 (for £90) to win a prize and the prestige that goes along with it, including a group photo on our website. If you want to come as an individual or a couple you will be asked to join other likeminded people on a table.

Our Tombola at Teddington Village Fair on 28th June was as popular as ever with over 110 prizes to be won. We ensured there were no tears by giving a consolation prize to young children. Quite a few visitors to our stall requested more information about our services and we were delighted to welcome Dr Tania Mathias MP, our newly elected Twickenham MP.

Members of our Young People’s Advisory Group meet Dr Tania Mathias, MP for Twickenham Posted on October 19, 2016  by  otr  | 

Leave a reply 



Off the Record’s Young People’s Advisory Group recently met Dr Tania Mathias,  MP for Twickenham and our Patron, to discuss current issues for young people around mental health and to share views on what good mental health care in local schools should look like.  The priorities for the group are:

Raising awareness about mental health
Prevention through good education so that young people have a better understanding of mental health and how they can help themselves and others
Early intervention – access to support early on to prevent situations and conditions developing
Improving the quality of support that young people get when they ask for help
Trained workforce – training teachers so they have the skills and confidence to support young people

If you’d like to get involved in the work of the group so that you can have your say about issues that are important to you and your friends, get in touch with Sophie Adam to find our how you could help.
 


Dr Mathias MP, Freya Connor, Lewis Jones, Anurada Desilva, Isabel Castle, Tianna Patel, Zahra Bhatti, Jacob Kelly

Home » feedback from clients 






Dan (age 13)
Dan had an explosive and violent temper, disrupted classes and did no work. At school he saw an OTR counsellor who heard that his mother had died but no one had properly explained anything, and his Dad now had a new partner. He was very upset, with no outlet for his feelings, except football. With his counsellor he talked about football and his feelings generally, and found other ways to express himself. His teacher said he was a different child; working, well-behaved and happier.
Susan (age 15) 
Susan was helped by OTR to overcome a history of sexual abuse by her grandfather. The impact on family and friends of her disclosure was traumatic for her; and she was self-harming. Therapy helped her explore her feelings and come to terms with her past. 
Naomi (age 11)
Naomi was upset at her parents divorce and often missed school, panicking at the gates and going home again. Talking about her fears of the future helped her to manage her feelings and she felt able to return to school. Her friendships also improved.

Confidentiality – Will we repeat what you say to anyone else?
If you are referred by a parent/doctor/teacher etc. we will not tell them you are coming here if you don’t want us to.
Nothing you tell us will be passed on to anyone outside the service without your knowledge and consent, except in the following situations:

If we are seriously worried about your or someone else’s safety, and we think it would be helpful to tell someone, we would discuss with you who the best person to tell might be (except in a crisis situation, if you were ill or unconscious, for example).
There might be a situation when we’re very concerned for your safety but you don’t want us to tell anyone else. If we still decide to talk to someone without your agreement, we will always tell you who they are, what we say to them and why – we would also let you know what will happen next.

In reality, we almost never share information without your consent.
You can discuss this more with any of the staff at Off The Record if you need to.
Sometimes you might want someone else to know what is happening to you. If you like, we can help you decide who the best person is to tell.

About us 
Off The Record is a small charity which serves its local community, providing the only walk-in service for young people in crisis in the borough. We see approximately 1,000 new young people for 3,000 sessions every year. These statistics indicate that 1 in every 3 young people who live in this borough from the age of 11 to 24 may have accessed our service at some point.
Off The Record is supported by a team of dedicated volunteer counsellors and two paid part-time managers. Borough grants for services like ours are no longer available and, while we are supported by two highly-valued local funders, Hampton Fuel Allotment Charity and Richmond Parish Lands Charity, most other funding has to be raised annually through applying to trusts and foundations. Raising funds in this way can be extremely difficult and time-consuming work, and we need more diverse and regular sources of funding in order to survive.
Support Off The Record in one of 3 ways: 

volunteer your time
make a donation 
do a fundraising event 

 
Staying in touch
Thanks for visiting our website. If you are interested in Off The Record and want to add your email address to our supporters’ database, please do. Submit email address
We will notify our supporters of any service updates, fundraising events and new vacancies.

Counselling and Information
Drop-in information service:
This is staffed by experienced counsellors who provide walk-in crisis counselling or information on most issues, including low-threshold sexual health information and condoms. We also stock leaflets on most issues, and can refer young people to other services as appropriate.
Appointment-based counselling:
22 volunteer counsellors offer a variety of therapies; counsellors are mainly humanistic, and can work flexibly in client-centred ways – using play or games as appropriate for each client.
Contract length and waiting list:
We offer 12 session contracts as we always have a waiting list (between 2-5 weeks), but we aim to be flexible and may occasionally extend a contract where clearly necessary.
Referrals:
Young people can self-refer by phoning, emailing or dropping in. Self-referral usually results in higher service uptake. However we do take referrals from parents/carers or other professionals. You can refer by phone or email, but we have an online referral form if you prefer (Referral form).
Confidentiality:
Off The Record offers a high level of confidentiality, as required by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), whose ethical code we abide by. However we always work in partnership when it is in the young person’s best interest (and with their permission) or, if a serious safeguarding concern arises, potentially without permission.
Walk-in Sexual Health clinic
We run a Monday sexual health clinic in partnership with the Hounslow and Richmond Community Health Trust. They provide family planning nurses who prescribe to 13 year olds upwards, but can give advice and information to young people under 13. It is currently the only dedicated young people’s clinic in the borough.
Off The Record holds the Department of Health You’re Welcome quality mark for excellence in young people’s health services. We also hold the borough Healthy Schools kite mark, and are a member of the BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy) and Youth Access.
See MindEd elearning to support young healthy minds.

Please feel free to email us with any feedback you might have – you might have suggestions for improvements or want to tell us about something at Off The Record that really worked for you. Let us know if we can share what you say with other people (we won’t identify you).

Issues we can help with
These are some common issues that you might have to deal with at some time in your life.

Abuse
Anger
Anxiety & stress
Bullying
Depression
Disability
Domestic abuse
Drugs
Eating problems
Housing
OCD
Relationships & family
Self-harm
Sexuality

For information on more issues see youngminds
Abuse
Children are dependent on adults for their development and well-being but unfortunately some adults take advantage of this. This is called abuse and a young person under the age of 16 has a legal right to be protected from abuse. There are four main categories:
Physical abuse is where a young person is hit, punched, kicked, burned, poisoned… in fact anything which causes them bodily harm.
 Sexual abuse involves forcing or inviting a young person to take part in sexual activities. It’s still abusive even if the child feels they’ve allowed it to happen. It also includes being made to watch and/or take part in pornographic material.
Emotional abuse is behaviour which damages a young person’s emotional development, for example, continually giving a child the message that he/she is worthless and unloved, or only useful when they meet the needs of someone else.
Neglect is abusive when a carer doesn’t provide for a young person’s basic physical needs (such as adequate food, shelter and clothing), so that a child’s health and development is seriously damaged. It’s also neglectful not to respond to a child’s basic emotional needs.
The abuser is usually a member of the young person’s family, a friend, or someone else they know and trust, making it difficult for the abused child to tell anyone. They may eventually talk to try and protect younger brothers or sisters from the same thing happening. Abuse should never be ignored and no matter what the victim is told, it’s never the fault of the person being abused.
Anger
More and more young people come to Off The Record because they have problems managing their anger. Anger is a very natural response when things don’t seem fair in life, or something bad happens. We all get angry sometimes. Just feeling angry should not be a problem – it’s how we express our anger that can get us into trouble. If we hold our anger in, it can build up and explode, usually in the wrong moment, and we can upset people and lose friends. But nobody wants their anger to control them, so that they regret the things they do. If it’s not appropriate (or safe) to show our anger, say, in school, it can help to talk to someone about how we feel instead.
In counselling we can explore and understand where our anger comes from, and what happens physically when we get angry. We may see family patterns of anger and how we’ve learnt our behaviour from other people. When we start to see the triggers that make us angry, we can find better ways to manage conflict. We can also learn to stand up and tell people calmly when we feel that something is wrong, without losing it. Anger can be a good thing when it pushes us to make positive changes in our life.
Anxiety and stress
Anxiety is a natural feeling that we all feel from time to time. It’s the body’s ‘fight or flight’ response to a threat or challenge, so in many ways it can be useful. But if a person gets anxious too often or at the wrong time it can start to affect their thoughts and behaviour in negative ways. For example, you can get panic attacks which can be very frightening, although they won’t do any real harm (you might feel sick and faint, sweat a lot, breathe fast or get palpitations). You might lose the confidence to try new things, find it hard to concentrate and have problems eating or sleeping. You might also have continual negative thoughts that bad things are going to happen.
Sometimes you know why you’re feeling anxious. Preparing for exams is a very stressful time. For some people social situations or events where you are the centre of attention are challenging. If a friend or family member is ill or had died, it’s not uncommon to feel insecure and worry about bad things happening to others who are close to you. Lots of changes in life are scary and difficult to manage, and when you get anxious suddenly everything can feel overwhelming. But talking about it to someone can help you begin to see the patterns and understand the causes better; it can put things in perspective and bring the anxiety back under control again.
Bullying
Bullying takes place in many ways. It can be physical – when a person or a group threatens, hits or kicks another person. It can be name-calling, teasing, spreading nasty stories about someone or excluding them from the group. People also use their mobile phones or the internet to threaten and torment others. You can be bullied for any sort of reason – like your race, sex, hair colour – there’s never any valid reason though; a bully will always find something to pick on. If this kind thing is happening to you and you feel you can’t cope, or to someone else you know, you should tell someone about it – sooner rather than later, so it can be sorted out before it becomes too serious. Bullying is taken very seriously and most schools have an anti-bullying policy, (although that doesn’t always mean they are good at dealing with it). But it is also recognised that the person doing the bullying has problems and probably needs help, which is another good reason for not keeping quiet! Telling an adult you can trust, like a parent, family friend, teacher, counsellor or social worker is probably the best place to start.

Depression
Most people at some time in their life will feel low, anxious, sad, lonely or tearful, but if it continues for several months, affecting your everyday life and stopping you from doing the normal things you want to do, then it is called depression. About 5% of teenagers, or 3 people in every class, suffer from depression. Symptoms can include; struggling to sleep or sleeping more than usual, losing your appetite, not wanting to go out with friends, feeling really tired and unable to concentrate on anything – either school work or fun stuff, and feeling like you’re useless, worthless and not very loveable. You might also feel suicidal or like self-harming.
These feelings can be very distressing and obviously affect all of your life and relationships. You can also feel hopeless about the future ever changing, but there is always a reason for depression, even if you don’t know what it is yet. Sometimes you have had a difficult time in the past, or experienced a stressful event. It may be a learned coping behaviour from your family or have some genetic influence.
Counselling can provide a safe space for you to explore the events that may have led to you feeling like this. It can also help you to recognise why you feel depressed and look at strategies to help you out of your depression. This might happen quickly or take a longer time, depending on what the cause of your depression is.
Bipolar Disorder or manic depression is a much more rare condition, and it is when you experience very extreme mood swings, going from feeling very high to very low.  You may consider trying medication which can help keep your moods on a more even keel.
Disability
There are many organisations you can contact for support with any sort of disability, such as RichmondAid  or outsiders
Domestic Abuse
This is any kind of violence which involves controlling or threatening behaviour by any person from age 16 upwards, to a partner or family member. It might include psychological, physical, sexual, emotional or financial abuse. The violent behaviour is aimed at making a person feel less important than the abuser, dependent on them, and therefore powerless to get help from outside. It may also make the victim feel stupid and frightened. It includes ‘honour based’ violence.
This violence often, but not always, happens at home, and may involve a parent, carer, partner, brother or sister or someone else in the house. It usually happens many times – some victims are attacked over 35 times before first telling the police. Sometimes the attacker is drunk or on drugs and afterwards promises never to do it again. The victim is often made to believe he/she deserves it, and so does nothing to stop it. Even if a child is not being physically hurt, seeing a parent being harmed, or living in fear of the next assault, is very upsetting. Talking to someone outside the situation can help you to get a clearer understanding of what is happening and how you really feel.

Victim Support helpline 0845 3030 900
Drugs & Alcohol
People take drugs for all sorts of reasons; maybe to try and forget their problems, or because their friends do, or because they think it’s cool. Most young people will ‘experiment’ to see what it’s like. But drugs don’t have the same effect on everyone and what makes one person feel good might leave another feeling awful! Your mood, who you’re with and where you are also make a difference. You may drink to have a good time but too much alcohol or mixing it with drugs can have very serious side effects. Also, alcohol and drugs can be addictive which means that rather than just wanting a drink or a ‘fix’ the body begins to need it. There are programmes to help people come off drugs and alcohol but the emotional effect an addiction can have on you and your family might take a lot longer to get over.

Eating Problems
Food is an important part of life and it’s quite normal to have patterns around eating. But food can become a problem when it’s used to help avoid or control painful feelings and stressful situations. When eating patterns become obsessive, an eating disorder can develop. Often low self-esteem is involved, but difficulties at home or at school, sexual or emotional abuse or any other problem can set it off. For teenagers, feeling insecure about how their bodies are changing may be the trigger. At first, the eating disorder may give them a sense of control over their life and their body, but as time goes on it’s clear that the eating disorder is controlling them.
If you’re aware that you’re starving yourself (anorexia), bingeing and then making yourself vomit (bulimia) or compulsively over-eating it’s important to find help because after a while it can do serious harm to your physical and mental health which can’t be repaired later. Telling someone might feel very scary but because of your behaviour and appearance, the people close to you have probably guessed what is happening, and talking about it yourself could be one of the most important steps to getting better.

Housing
If you are 16-17 and homeless, the council has an obligation to house you as soon as possible, but if you are older it is extremely difficult to get housing in Richmond borough. For more information and help on this area, contact the following organisations.

Obsessive Compulsive disorder
This disorder has 2 parts to it – the obsessive part where you have invasive or worrying thoughts, and the compulsive part where you feel driven to acting out rituals or behaving in stuck patterns, like constantly washing your hands; this might be in an attempt to stop the unwanted thoughts you’re having. Many people have a mild version of this behaviour which doesn’t really affect their life, but if it gets very bad it can make day to day life extremely difficult. It can be treated, so if you think you may suffer from this problem it’s worth asking for help.
www.ocduk.org/young-peoples-ocd-guide
Relationships & Family
All types of relationships can be difficult to manage – family, friends or partners. The truth is that everyone is on a lifelong learning curve trying to get it right. TV and films don’t help us, because they set out a romantic ideal of love and friendship which is very far from the truth. All relationship break-ups are usually very painful because we do need family and friends and it always hurts when someone rejects us, even if we tell ourselves it doesn’t.
Whether it’s our own relationships we’re struggling with, or our family that’s breaking up, it can be frightening, and we often feel that we have no control over what’s happening. Sometimes we feel to blame when our parents argue or split up, but it’s not our fault, and we can’t make things better either. The break-up is between your parents not you, although it will usually have a big impact on your life too, and will probably be a difficult time for you.
If you lose someone through family break-up, or through death, you are likely to feel a wide range of strong emotions, including loss, anger, regret, sadness, depression, and feelings of denial. It can take a long time to come to terms with any changes.
Because relationships are central to our life you may find that your school work begins to suffer and you lose concentration and interest in school, or anything else in your life.  If things get too confusing, talking to a counsellor may help you to understand your feelings and find a way to cope better with what’s going on, including any changes to your family life.
For support around divorce see www.divorceaid.co.uk or, if someone dies, you might contact www.rd4u.org.uk or www.winstonswish.org.uk
Self-harm
Self-harm is when someone hurts themselves deliberately, usually by scratching, cutting or burning their skin, or by hitting themselves. It can also include taking dangerous drugs, too much alcohol, not eating and neglecting themselves. Often they keep what they are doing very secret as other people can get angry with them and say things like ‘you’re only doing it to get attention’. But usually a person self-harms because the pain they feel when they do it balances with, or helps lessen, the pain they feel inside. Or it distracts them from their emotional pain, or helps them feel something instead of just feeling numb. Other people harm themselves because they feel like a bad person. People often self-harm as a way to cope with their feelings when they don’t know what else to do, but there are other ways to cope, and talking is a good place to start.
www.harmless.org.uk; www.selfharm.co.uk; www.thesite.org
Sexuality
This is to do with your sexual feelings and what turns you on – you may be attracted to the opposite sex, the same sex or both. For most of us it can take a long time to feel comfortable with our sexuality. But it can be even harder if you’re gay or bi-sexual because society contains many prejudiced people who disapprove. However, there’s nothing wrong with your sexuality, and there are many other people who will feel like you. You might have parents who blame themselves or say ‘it’s just a phase you’re going through’, but this is untrue. You may have known from an early age that you felt different from the majority of your friends. However, you don’t always know from the start if you’re gay or straight – you may have thoughts and feelings for some time which leave you confused, and you can also ‘change sides’ at different times in your life. All these things are normal, so if you can accept who you are and what you feel, you’ll become more confident about expressing yourself. This may include telling your friends or family or trying to meet other gay and bi-sexual young people (which definitely helps). Talking to a counsellor may also help.
www.tht.org.uk; www.pacehealth.org.uk; www.ligs.org.uk; www.queeryouth.net
You may have other gender issues such as gender dysphoria (transgender), where you feel that you were born the wrong sex. Talking to someone with experience in this area is always helpful. Contact www.genderedintelligence.co.uk or www.metrocentreonline.org

Counselling








 

 

 



What is counselling?
Counselling is when someone listens to how you feel
A counsellor won’t judge you or tell you what to do
Counsellors are there to understand and support you
If talking is difficult, you can also use drawing, clay or other play materials
Counsellors help you work things through when you have problem
What you say in counselling is confidential
Who can come to counselling?
Anyone between ages 11 and 24 who lives, works or studies in Richmond borough can come here.
Counselling is FREE for under 18s but we ask you for a donation if you are over 18 and in work.
How does counselling help?
Sharing a problem with someone who really understands can make it easier
You can use counselling to gain a clearer view of things, and make decisions or changes in your life
Sometimes you can’t change a situation, but together with your counsellor you may find better ways of coping
Sometimes just one session can make a big difference
What problems might you bring to counselling?

problems with family or friends
anxiety or depression
eating difficulties or self-harm
bullying or problems at school
feeling isolated or lonely
death or loss of someone close
sexual abuse – past or present
feelings of anger or violence
drug or alcohol problems
worries about your sexuality
self-esteem or confidence issues

You might also just be feeling down, and don’t know why. You can come and talk to us about anything at all. No problem is too big or too small. If we can’t help, we will do our best to find you someone who can. See our Issues page for more information.
How can you contact us?
Drop in during opening hours
Email us
Call us on 020 8744 1644
What happens next?
We’ll take your details and book you an initial appointment as soon as we can – usually within about 2 weeks (sooner if it’s urgent). You can then talk to the counsellor and decide whether counselling might be helpful to you.
There might then be a 2-4 week wait for your weekly counselling to start – but you can continue to use our drop-in service to come and talk if this is helpful.
Your appointments will be at the same time each week, and each session lasts up to 50 minutes. We can offer you 12 sessions of counselling in the first instance.
You can stop at any time, and you can see a male or female counsellor. If you’re not sure your counsellor’s right for you, ask to see someone else – it’s important to find the right person for you.
If you need to talk to someone now, call a 24 hour helpline:
Childline: 0800 1111
Samaritans: 08457 909090
NSPCC: 0808 800 5000
You can find other counselling services for young people in Richmond or neighbouring boroughs here
We can also provide support, information and referral to parents and carers of young people who are going through difficult times.

Our walk-in service is FREE and confidential.
You can drop-in (on your own or with friends), phone us on 020 8744 1644, or email us.

We can help by giving information and are happy to talk about anything that might be bothering you.

Home » About us 






Who we are
Off The Record provides counselling from trained volunteer Councillors, and a sexual health clinic staffed by nurses. Our centre is relaxed and non-clinical. We’re open after school and on Saturday mornings. Hundreds of young people, between the ages of 11 and 25 come here every year and receive a friendly welcome; they get confidential help, support and information for anything that worries them. They come to see the nurses when they are too scared to go to their GP.
We also offer support to parents and a consultation service to those working with troubled young people.
Background – Why we are needed
Children rapidly begin to fail when they don’t learn from parents how to cope with life. This has a huge effect on their performance at school. With our help, the children at your school will learn social skills and perform better. The earlier we help them, the quicker they can recover. We often see dramatic positive change in the children that come to us.

Event date: Friday 15th May, 7 PM
Event venue: St Mary’s Church Hall, Twickenham


Quiz and wine evening

Off the Record Twickenham is running a Quiz and Wine Evening on Friday 15th May at St Mary’s Church Hall, Church St, Twickenham. This fun event will start at 7pm with a wine tasting of five wines from the award-winning Doran Vineyards followed by a Ploughman’s supper of cheese, pate, bread and fruit. During the evening there will be several rounds of a not too fiendish quiz as well as a raffle and a cash bar for those who want to continue to drink the wine after the wine-tasting session.


wine tasting

This is an opportunity for friends to come as a team of 6 (for £90) to win a prize and the prestige that goes along with it, including a group photo on our website. If you want to come as an individual or a couple you will be asked to join other likeminded people on a table.

Funders
Off The Record has been running for 21 years, and is well-known in the borough.
We run the ONLY dedicated young people’s sexual health clinic, and the only walk-in information and crisis counselling service – set in an easy-access youth-friendly non-clinical venue.
We provide early intervention, non-stigmatizing services, accessible to all.
See our Business Plan for more information or last year’s Annual Report.
Our core services are delivered through direct grant-funding, primarily from the following

City Bridge Trust
Hampton Fuel Allotment Charity
Richmond Parish Lands Charity
Driver Youth Trust

We also receive funding to support a number of projects, including our satellite services, from:

Hampton Fuel Allotment Charity
Richmond Clinical Commissioning Group
Richmond Parish Lands Charity
Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd
Mrs Smith and Mount Trust

Richmond Parish Lands Charity and Hampton Fuel Allotment Charity have also generously provided funding for a major premises refurbishment project in 2017.  
Our grateful thanks to these organisations and to all those who support our work.
 
The need we serve
Many of our service users present with complex needs and are desperately seeking help. Richmond borough has above the national average in recorded incidents of neglect and emotional abuse in its young people, and a high level of mental health problems. Coping alone with problems can result in a lifetime of isolation, difficult relationships and low self-esteem, resulting in serious under-achievement throughout their lives. The benefits of having somewhere to turn in a moment of crisis range from crisis-prevention, such as suicide, to simply helping a young person get on with a normal life.
Because the service is free and confidential many young people come to us when they are too scared to go to their parents or GP, or to seek help from statutory services. Immediate walk-in access off the street, providing help when they need it, is essential in reaching ‘at risk’ and disaffected young people. A borough-wide survey by LBRUT Children’s Services in 2013 showed that 39% of young people who completed it knew of or had used our service.
Our statistics indicate that 1 in every 3 young people who live in this borough from the age of 11 to 24 will have accessed our service at some point.
Partners
We work alongside other borough mental health services, including GPs, and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), with schools, and a number of other charities. Many other services refer young people to us when they need in-depth therapeutic support. Over 50% of our counselling clients come via their GP. We are currently setting up a young people’s advisory group to directly inform our service’s priorities and delivery, and ensure its ongoing relevance.
Yearly Outcomes
We provide 3,000+ sessions of support to @1,000 new young people
Almost all young people giving feedback say that the service helped them
Over 90% of counselling clients felt better overall
80% of counselling clients understood themselves better and 60% understood others better
70% said that their family relations improved
95% of all our users didn’t want to change anything about Off The Record.
Counselling works
Counselling supports reflection and change in young people; their confidence and self-esteem increases and they develop resilience and a greater capacity to make more life-affirming choices for themselves. A counselling intervention helps young people remain in, or return to, school or college, or supports them to get a job. We help to change young people’s lives before patterns of dysfunctional behaviour and emotions become entrenched. This in turn supports the wider community to function better, both socially and economically.
Value for Money
The counselling service is provided by volunteer counsellors, and our premises are provided free by St Mary’s Church. With our partnership clinic with the Hounslow and Richmond Community Health Trust, the support of trustees, and voluntary administrative support, we receive at least £70,000 of donated services. Therefore we can offer a high-quality professional counselling service for under £35 per session.
Off The Record holds the Department of Health You’re Welcome quality mark for excellence in young people’s health services. We also hold Richmond borough’s Healthy Schools kite mark.

Sexual Health Service
If you are having sex, or thinking about it, you may be worried about getting pregnant or catching a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Why not drop in on any Monday for a chat.  You can talk to our specially trained nurses about anything to do with sex and contraception.
Anyone up to 24 years old can come and everything is FREE and confidential. As well as giving advice, we can provide:



Pregnancy testing
Contraception e.g. the pill, condoms, the contraceptive injection
Emergency contraception (morning after pill)
Chlamydia testing (and referral for other STI screening)
Referral for termination of pregnancy.



Please note that we cannot offer sexual health examinations, STI treatment or IUDS (intra-uterine devices), implants or cap fittings. However we can tell you where else to go for these.
If you are unable to drop in on Mondays, remember that condoms, plus chlamydia and pregnancy tests are available at all OTR walk-in times (see the panel on the right for our opening times).
Sexual Health FAQ
Can I get free contraception?
Yes. If you’re having sex and don’t want to get pregnant or catch an STI, you can come and get a supply of pills (or the injection, which lasts 3 months). Our nurse always gives out condoms, because only condoms can protect you from STIs.
Can I have a pregnancy test?
If your period should have started and hasn’t, we can test you. The test will only be accurate from the first day your period is due, not before then. If you’ve had sex as recently as the last 2 weeks it’s too early to get an accurate result.
What if I’m pregnant?
If you are pregnant the nurse will discuss with you what options you have. If you decide to have a termination, the nurse can make the referral to hospital for you. If you are 13+ your parents don’t have to know, but you will need an older friend to go to hospital with you. You can also get counselling support at OTR if you want it.
What if I need emergency contraception?
Emergency contraception (‘morning after’ pill) MUST be taken within 72 hours (3 days) of having unprotected sex – but the sooner you can take it, the better. If you can’t get to Monday’s clinic, the ‘morning after’ pill is available free for 13-24 year olds at:

Goodes Pharmacy, 22 London Road, Twickenham
Teddington Memorial Hospital – Walk-in Centre, Hampton Road, Teddington 020 8714 4004

What if I have a sexually transmitted infection (STI)?
Some STIs can cause soreness or discharge. Others, like chlamydia, may have no symptoms, but if left untreated can damage your reproductive system and leave you infertile. If you have any worries about catching an STI, it’s worth getting checked. We can test you for chlamydia and gonorrhea, which (like all STIs) are very easy to treat with antibiotics. For an examination or a full test covering all STIs, you need to go to a doctor or hospital sexual health clinic
Where else can I go for Sexual Health services?
Other sources of information and help are here
What if I’m having problems with my boyfriend/girlfriend?
The nurse will be happy to talk to you about any emotional or sexual problems you may be having. She may also refer you to a counsellor at OTR if you feel it would be helpful to have more time to talk.
Is the clinic open every Monday?
We are open every Monday throughout the year except for Bank Holidays.
